For assistance with research and access to participants, I would like to thank the Chinese Rugby Football Association, Beijing Xiannongtan Sports Institute, and the Shandong Sports Institute (Weihai).  This research would not have been possible without the warm welcome I have received from the Chinese rugby community for the past 12 years. I would like to thank Liu Kai for being my friend and guardian in China.

To my supervisor, Emma Cohen, thank you for going above and beyond for me. I am indebted for all the time you have invested in my development and my research.  To Bronwyn Tarr, thank you for stepping in, and for all your time and effort on my behalf.  To all at ICEA, thank you. Cole, Bahar, Megan, Adam, Hristo, Dan, and Kat.  Arran Davis --- you are a true companion and I cherish our connection.

I feel deep thanks for my family: Julia, John, and Sandy.  Above all, I would like to thank my partner, Nina, for her love and support.
