\section{Group hunting in Chimpanzees\label{sect:groupHunt}}
Group hunting has been well documented in various geographically distinct populations of Chimpanzees (i.e. by \textcite{Goodall1986}  in Gombe national park, by \textcite{Uehara1997} in Mahale Mountains National Park, and by \textcite{Boesch1989, Boesch1994} in the Tai National Park in Ivory Coast West Africa.  This triangulation of observations suggests a species-wide capacity for elaborate coordination combined with bouts of intense physiological exertion.   Observational studies suggest that the size and membership of hunting parties vary greatly, from a single chimpanzee to as many as 35 \citep{Stanford1994}.  In addition, hunting frequency appears to covary with fluctuations in group size  \citep[and particularly number of sexually receptive females in the group; see][]{Stanford1996}.
Observational studies suggest that the size and membership of hunting parties vary greatly, from a single chimpanzee to as many as 35 \citep{Stanford1994}: Typically, a group first gathers and then simultaneously fans out in search for a victim while reducing the chances of detection by avoiding vocalisations and using slow and careful steps to minimise noise \citep{Boesch1989,Mitani2001}.  There is also a division of labor based on roles that was characterized by Boesch and Boesch (1989) as collaboration: a ``blocker;'' a ``chaser;'' an ``ambusher;'' and others remaining on the ground to track the hunt and intercept a fleeing target if the opportunity arises.

The evolutionary function of group hunting in Chimpanzees may not be limited to a nutritional shortfall hypothesis (which suggests that chimpanzees hunt to compensate for seasonal shortages in food availability).  A second hypothesis argues that male chimpanzees hunt to obtain meat that they swap for matings \citep{Stanford1994}. A third hypothesis proposes that males use meat as a social tool to develop and maintain alliances with other males \citep{Mitani2001}.



\section{Neurobiological reward in exercise\label{sect:neuroRewardGE}}
A series of laboratory studies involving human and non-human subjects exercising on stationary exercise equipment (treadmills, watt bikes) show that sustained aerobic exercise at a moderate intensity ($\sim70-85\%$ of maximum heart rate)---but not low ($\sim45\%$) or high ($\sim90\%$) intensities---induces activity in the endocannabinoid (eCB) system \citep{Raichlen2013}, and similar results have been obtained in studies on the opioidergic system \citep{Boecker2008}.  Endocannabinoids appear to play an influential role in exercise-specific neurobiological reward, with studies showing activation eCB activation in moderately intense exercise and in cursorial mammals, such as humans and dogs \citep[but not non-cursorial mammals, e.g., ferrets;][]{Raichlen2012}.  In addition to direct peripheral (analgesic) and central (psychological well-being and alteration) effects, eCBs are responsible for activating ``traditional'' neurotransmitters (opioids, dopamine, and serotonin), which reward and reinforce behaviour \citep{Sparling2003}.  These findings lead Raichlen to propose eCBs as a key neurobiological substrate responsible for motivating habitual engagement in aerobic exercise, by generating ``appetitive'' and hedonic associations with exercise behaviour \citep{Raichlen2012}.
