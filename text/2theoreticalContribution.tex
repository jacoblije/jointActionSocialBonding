\section{The development of visceral agency in rugby's newest recruit\label{sect:SHW}}
Sun Hongwei arrived, escorted by his high school athletics coach, to the Beijing Temple of God of Agriculture Institute of Sport (hereafter the Institute) soon after I began my fieldwork in August 2015.  An 18-year-old with a slight build and timid demeanour---his gaze remained diverted to the ground during his first few months at the Institute---Hongwei later told me that he had never seen a rugby ball before that day he arrived.

Hongwei was from Hebei province, immediately surrounding the special prefecture of Beijing, China's capital.  Hongwei's coach had organised a trial for Hongwei with the Beijing Provincial men’s and women's Rugby Program (hereafter the Program) by calling upon social connections to the leadership of the Institute.  Athletes come to the Rugby Program from all over the country.  As I explain in more detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:researchSetting}, to represent Beijing at a provincial level in a sport like rugby can translate into the opportunity to gain entrance to one of China's top universities and enhanced career employment opportunities thereafter.

Rugby is not a popular sport in China, but its recent inclusion in the Olympic games (in the form of the modified seven-a-side version of ``rugby sevens'') means that it now occupies a prominent place in the Chinese sport system.  Rugby programs such as the one at the Institute now exist in 12 of China's 34 provincial level regions, either embedded within, or somehow associated with, tertiary education institutions.  Thus, although rugby and China are not commonly associated terms, rugby now affords Chinese athletes a rare and under-capitalised opportunity to pursue attractive life-course opportunities of education and employment in an intensely competitive education system.

Without exception, the athletes who arrive at the Institute to join the rugby team were not like me; they had not spent their childhoods playing rugby in their schoolyards or watching professional rugby on television. Many who come to rugby transition from other more popular sports such as athletics, basketball, or association football, and often---like Hongwei---have never seen a rugby ball before they arrive.  Most athletes start from scratch, so to speak, in terms of their grasp of the requirements of the highly interactive and technically complex team sport.  In addition to complex patterns of movement coordination, rugby also involves unrestrained body-on-body collisions and intense bouts of high physiological exertion.  To perform all of rugby’s technical requirements successfully requires a combination of speed, strength, agility, and endurance (see Chapter~\ref{sect:rugbyUnion}).  Learning the game of rugby from a baseline of essentially zero, while also navigating the inevitably demanding social and political dynamics within the team and the Institute, was clearly going to be a daunting task for Hongwei.


                        \begin{center}

 Even compared to other newly arrived junior athletes, I noticed that Hongwei was particularly timid and shy, especially in his interactions with the senior players and coaches (myself included).  Nevertheless, Hongwei clearly signalled diligence and commitment through his participation in team activities.  He arrived early to each training session, and carried more than his fair share of the training equipment---a task shared by the most junior members of the team.  Each time I passed Hongwei in the corridors of the Institute he would greet me with a polite bow and greeting, ``Hello Coach'' (\textit{'jiaolian hao'} `教练好').  In these instances, Hongwei would coordinate his greeting with a moment's eye contact, only to return his gaze to the floor and continue walking.

Due to his lack of familiarity with the basic techniques of rugby, Hongwei was initially unable to fully participate in normal training with the rest of the team.  Instead, during the first month or so, Hongwei remained on the sidelines of the field and practiced the basics with other athletes who were unable to fully participate in training due to injury. He began with the absolute basics: learning how to pass and catch the rugby ball, while stationary and running in-motion. In my eyes at least---eyes of an observer accustomed to instinctual grasp of these movements from a young age---I found Hongwei’s attempts to accustom himself with the skills of rugby jarring. The idiosyncrasies of rugby’s ovular ball often foiled him.  I would regularly see him on the sidelines of training chasing after a ball that he’d just fumbled; the idiosyncratic shape of the ovular rugby ball meant that it would change direction like it were a scurrying rabbit tactfully evading its pursuer.

                        \end{center}

I interviewed Hongwei approximately six weeks after he arrived at the Institute.  Hongwei's demeanour during the interview was consistent with the timid and shy one that he presented publicly at training.  As I explain below, he did show some signs of captivation with his new sport and social environment.  When I asked about his initial impressions of the on-field demands of rugby, however, Hongwei was quick to confess that he felt utterly unacquainted:

  \begin{quote}
    SHW: I still haven’t really started to practice any of the team plays or anything; all I can do so far is pass and run a little bit...(but) it's quite fun! \\
    JT: What do you think is the most difficult component of rugby? \\
    SHW: Um\textellipsis well, coordinating with teammates [on the field], particularly coordination in attack.  Because I can't figure it out.  When I first arrived, I didn’t even know what a ``switch play'' or a ``blocker play'' was.
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
    SHW: 战术没怎么接触，就是像传球啊、跑动什么的会一点了 \\
    JT: 感觉怎么样？\\
    SHW: 挺好玩的！\\
    JT: 你认为橄榄球最难的一部分是什么？ \\
    SHW: ...打配合，进攻的配合，因为搞不明白，刚来的时候也不知道什么交叉，后插什么的 \\
  \end{quote}

Hongwei was self-critical in this confession regarding his minimal grasp of the technical requirements of joint action in rugby.  The obvious stress and anxiety he expressed was indicative of a broader trend with the other athletes I interviewed, as I will explain in more detail in the ethnographic sections of this dissertation (see Chapters ~\ref{chap:ethnoField}\nobreakdash~\ref{chap:ethnoResults}). When athletes were asked in interviews about the most difficult aspect of rugby, on-field coordination with teammates was by far the most common answer, particularly among the new recruits and most junior athletes.

As I directed the interview towards topics beyond the on-field technical demands of rugby, Hongwei was more positive, framing rugby as an exciting new opportunity, and commenting that his friends and family were in awe of the fact that he is playing such an impressively ``strong'' (\textit{qiangzhuang} 强壮) physical sport like rugby.  When I asked him about something new that he had learnt through playing rugby, Hongwei automatically responded by emphasising the social dimensions to his experience at the Institute:

  \begin{quote}
    ...I think it's mainly this thing of having teammates. Before, when I was training for an individual sport, it was just me training by myself. [In that environment] it was a case of whoever trained well was successful.  But now with this team of brothers, elder teammates will take care of younger teammates. We all train together, and if you can’t do something, you can always ask your elder teammates...[Rugby] is so much better, because in an individual sport, if you can't master something, you have to go to your coach for help. Other athletes don't want to teach you, because if you surpass them, then they have to work even harder to keep up... I have had to learn about helping others, because rugby is not like an individual sport, where you look after your own performance and that's it.  In a team sport, if you don't do well, there's no need to get too frustrated or upset, because other athletes will help you out, and I will also help others out, that type of collaboration with each other.
  \end{quote}

Hongwei's explicit reference to the collegiality of the team, and his position as junior member, highlights that the technical skills of rugby were not the only novel components of his experience.  Hongwei's background was in track and field (his event was pentathlon, very much an individual sport), and the team environment was completely new to him.  This was also the case for many of the other athletes in the team.  As I listened to his experiences associating rugby and group membership, I could not help but associate the quality of these explicit declarations of group membership with his overly mechanical imitation of rugby's foundational techniques.  In both I saw his willingness and desire to signal commitment; but both lacked---at the outset at least---a certain level of grasp or conviction.  In the case of his explicit celebration of rugby's social resources in interview, for example, I got the impression that Hongwei was telling me what he thought he ought to say, without actually deeply believing these things to be unequivocally true.


                            \begin{center}
                              * * *
                            \end{center}

A few months passed, and Hongwei continued to train.  He was as eager and committed as when he began, and I did notice some gradual improvement in his grasp of rugby's basic skills.  But he also remained extremely reserved, keeping his head low at all times in team settings, unless addressed by senior players or coaches.

Then, one evening when I had returned to my room in the Institute dormitory from a three week hiatus in Australia for Christmas, I heard a knock on my open door, and to my surprise Hongwei took an assertive stride into my room, carrying in two arms a draw-string bag containing rugby balls (which were in need of more air before the next day's training session).  Hongwei had never ventured into my room before, apart from when I invited him in for our first interview two months earlier---but certainly never before had he entered on his own accord.  Hongwei looked me straight in the eyes with his head held high and energy radiating from his face and upright chest.  I could not help but smile and ask, with genuine intrigue, ``How have you found training recently?'' (最近练得怎样？)
``Very good'' （很好）he said, assertively and excitedly.  ``Much better than before.  At least now I know what’s going on at training, I can keep up with the plays!'' （比以前好多了, 至少现在训练的时候知道该干什么，战术什么的能跟得上！） A big smile spontaneously grew on his face as he continued to hold my gaze confidently.  ``Oh good!'' I said, a little bit shocked.  I congratulated him for his hard work in training while I had been away, and encouraged him to keep at it.  At this, Hongwei took leave by bowing politely and saying ``Thanks coach'' (谢谢教练).  ``Wow,'' I remember thinking to myself.  What quantity had all of a sudden possessed Hongwei? Was it possible that his diligent adherence to rugby over those first four months at the Institute had instilled him with a visceral sense of personal and social agency?

\section{Introduction}

%HW's change is a change in attitude (Bateson) agency
How can we scientifically account for the unmistakably visceral and agentic quality of Hongwei's transformation from timid newcomer to budding Beijing rugby player?  As the story of Hongwei anecdotally suggests, the physical and social dimensions of experience in group exercise may take time to develop.  Presumably in Adrian I witnessed the finished product: through many years of on- and off-field engagement with the sport of rugby, Adrian came to personally embody rugby as a social identity, and was thus able to profess its carnal mystery from a place of deep, intuitive knowing (see Chapter~\ref{sect:adrian}).  When I met him during my first stint of research at the Institute, Hongwei was only just beginning this journey.  Over an extended period of ethnographic research it became clear to me that---for Hongwei and others like him---an increase in familiarity with both the on-field technical requirements of rugby and the off-field social regularities of being an athlete at the Institute came an increase in personal confidence, and a sense of group membership.  As explained in the previous chapter, a scientific theory capable of accounting for these dynamic and interlocking physical and social dimensions of group exercise is yet to be fully formulated.

In this chapter, I draw on existing empirical evidence and prevailing theories of social cognition to formulate a novel theoretical account of team click in group exercise.  I introduce the phenomenon of team click as a psychological construct capable of explaining the relationship between joint action and social bonding in group exercise settings.  As explained in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, existing anthropological approaches to the question of human bondedness and social cohesion could benefit from a more dynamical model of social cognition, in which physiological and social processes are more integrated in an account of information transfer  \citep{Roepstorff2010,Badcock2012,Ramstead2017}.  Such a model would allow for scientific analysis of a fuller spectrum of component mechanisms and coordination dynamics in joint action that have been traditionally sidelined by cognitive and evolutionary approaches to human sociality \citep{Claidiere2007}.

%The theory proposed herein builds upon the hypothesis that group exercise is causally relevant to processes of social cohesion \citep{Dunbar2010,Whitehouse2014,Cohen2017}.
Synchrony and mimicry literatures:
The link between joint action and social bonding is well established in the behavioural mimicry and symmetry literatures \citep{Chartrand2009,Launay2016,Mogan2017}, but these studies do not investigate variation in uncertainty of joint action or evaluations of performance as a predictor of social effects.

UNCERTAINTY

of JA (suggested in the introduction), or its visceral and social dimensions (SHW as example, Adrian).
The role of cognitive uncertainty and unpredictability in dynamical and complex joint action scenarios on processes related to social bonding has not yet been the subject of focussed empirical research.
The physical--social link in joint action can be understood as a functional solution to the inherent uncertainty of joint action
Physical and social represent two ends of a continuum of cognitive strategies deployed by humans to reduce uncertainty inherent in joint action scenarios.
The result of effective physical coordination is enhanced social communication (including affective processes of affiliation and connection).  Likewise, effective social communication serves to establish, sustain, and enhance coordination of physical movement in joint action.
























As I explain in more detail below, there is evidence to suggest that the combination of cognitive complexity and physiological exertion in group exercise contexts will necessitate the deployment of more dynamical mechanisms of movement regulation in order to successfully establish and sustain joint action.  In turn

%team click
The phenomenology of team click captures a scenario in which coordination in joint action is perceived to be either optimal or maximal.  The visceral, and agentic dimensions of team click appear to set the foundation for high quality social bonding among co-actors.  While the social relevance of team click and the related concept of flow have evaded rigorous analysis within more traditional paradigms of social cognition \citep[for explanations as to why, see][]{Dietrich2004,Slingerland2014}, within the novel theory of social bonding through joint action proposed herein, team click can be explained in naturalistic terms as a special case of joint action in which the bonding effects of movement coordination are maximised.

%In this chapter I formulate a novel theory of social bonding through joint action, which could be mediated by team click.  I begin by introducing the phenomenon of team click---specifically its two core dimensions of viscerality and social agency (Section~\ref{sect:teamClickIntro}).  I then outline existing research suggesting a functional, bi-directional link between dynamical coordination of physical movement in joint action and social communication (Section~\ref{sect:physicalMovementSocialCommunication}).  With this theoretical grounding in place, I explain the parameters of joint action typical in group exercise contexts (Section~\ref{sect:JAinGE}), and propose team click as a construct capable of explaining a link between joint action high quality social connection---social bonding---in group exercise (Section~\ref{}).  The specific hypothesis of a general account of joint action, team click, and social bonding in group exercise are outlined in Section ~\ref{}.  I conclude this chapter by offering a road map for the  empirical studies that seek to test selected hypotheses from this general account.


%[e.g., emotional support, perceptions of common goal, and shared social identity]

%More so than most cultural variants that have traditionally formed the focus of scientific analysis, activities in which group exercise feature demand a dynamical conception of cognition.
%Current evidence suggests that group exercise contexts,  may demand higher levels of
%Group exercise invariably involves numerous brains and bodies engaged in ``in-the-moment'' and ``on-line'' joint action that unfolds over various timescales and engages multiple sensory modalities.  In addition, group exercise often involves sustained and rigorous physiological exertion, which appears to impose metabolic constraints on neurocognitive function \citep{Dietrich2011}.  In the case of interactional team sports, the goal of successful joint action within one team is often compromised by the competitive efforts of another team to foil their opponent's shared goal.  Taken together, all of these dimensions of group exercise serve to spike the cognitive uncertainty inherent in joint action.  Existing evidence suggests that regulation and management of cognitive uncertainty in group exercise requires canny recruitment of and coordination with the resources distributed throughout brains, bodies, and physical features of the specific joint action environment \citep{Clark2015}.

%In essence, just as team click can be understood as optimal or maximal coordination of physical movement, social bonding in joint action can be understood as optimal or maximal recruitment of social affordances for the functional purpose of reducing uncertainty in joint action and enabling ongoing adaptive behavioural coordination \citep{Ramstead2016}.
 %Specifically, I hypothesise causal relationships between 1) more positive perceptions of performance in joint action and higher levels of team click, and 2) higher levels of team click and higher levels of social bonding.  I conclude this chapter by outlining the predictions of a novel theory of social bonding through joint action (Section~\ref{}), which I test through empirical research in the chapters that follow.

%In particular, this research suggests that greater alignment of expectations, perceptions, and movements in joint action leads to greater perceptions of social connection.
%(see Chapter~\ref{sect:cogEvAnth}).

%In addition to ``cognitive'' processes (as they are narrowly defined by traditional stimulus-reponse paradigm of human cognition \citep[e.g.][]{Marr1985}), recent empirical research programs within cognitive and evolutionary anthropology have begun to draw attention the role of physiological mechanisms (e.g., neurobiological reward and autonomic arousal) in shaping human social behaviour, sociality, and cultural evolution.  As \textcite{Dunbar2010} suggest, it is impossible to accept that humans merely adhere to a ``dung fly'' model of social aggregation; clear scientific evidence now suggests, rather, that humans have evolved a species-unique tendency to actively congregate and cohere around shared cultural practices \citep[see][]{Tomasello2005}.

%In essence, to fully account for the diversity of profiles, subjective experiences, and social effects of group exercise, cognitive and evolutionary approaches require an appreciation not only of the singular operation of discrete proximate mechanisms (e.g., exercise-induced neuropharmacological reward or synchrony-induced self-other merging), but also a conception of how these discrete mechanisms dynamically \textit{coordinate} with each other in specific individuals and socio-cultural ecologies to produce subjective experience.  In this chapter I consider how physical and social processes interlock in joint action; in order to explain how social connection can emerge in instances in which joint action clicks.






\section{The empirical phenomenon of team click \label{sect:teamClickIntro}}
In this section I draw upon evidence from sporting anecdote, psychology, and anthropology in order to outline teh empirical foundations for the phenomenon of team click.  In addition, I point to evidence for the potential of team click as an explanatory construct linking joint action and social bonding in group exercise---a proposal which I justify theoretically in the following section.

One of the big mysteries of competitive team sport, particularly at the elite level, is the elusiveness of peak team performance.  While each individual athlete may exhibit expert level competence in sport specific skills, the much sought after aggregation of these components, i.e., a team that consistently performs ``in the zone,'' and ``firing on all cylinders,'' in reality often proves frustratingly difficult to achieve and sustain.  As \textcite[568]{King2011} note in their ethnography of the 2008 Cambridge University rowing crew who participated (and who were eventually victorious) in the famous annual Boat Race against Oxford University, the search for collective rhythm is a universal in human social interaction, but  the physiological and psychological complexity of finding that rhythm ``...is extremely difficult to attain; collective performance is a possibility not a certainty.''   The moment in which everything ``clicks'' into place in team sport can, for various reasons, disappear as abruptly as it arrives, if indeed it arrives at all.

But, when team click is somehow cultivated, and even sustained, it is celebrated as the ultimate, albeit often inexplicable magic of sporting feats. Consider Leicester City Football Club's unbelievable outhouse-to-penthouse title run in the 2015 English Premier League, the recent dominance of the Golden State Warriors in the American National Basketball Association (NBA), or the astonishingly consistent performance of the New Zealand men's national rugby union team (the ``All Blacks'').
    \footnote{The All Blacks are arguably the most successful sporting team ever, with a winning percentage of 77\% in the last 150 years (and 88\% in the last 6 years) \citep{Kerr2013}.}
All of these successful teams carry with them a powerful ``aura'' associated with their capacity to effectively coordinate their behaviours on the field over extended time scales: individual games, seasons, and, in the case of the All Blacks, entire generations.  The aura associated with such rare instances of sustained collective performance in elite sport can spur limitless fascination, fandom, and elaborate exegesis.

    %In this thesis I commit to the more banal task of naturalising the phenomenon of team click, by locating it within a novel theory of social bonding through joint action.

For athletes, coaches, and spectators alike, team click can be a hugely powerful sensation.  As theologian Michael Novak explains, ``[f]or those who have participated on a team that has known the click of communality, the experience is unforgettable, like that of having attained, for a while at least, a higher level of existence'' \citep[11]{White2011}. For the purposes of this dissertation, I use the term team click to describe the phenomenology of peak performance within a team of athletes engaged in joint action, but the term has potentially broader applications beyond group exercise (for example, in music making, spoken conversation, or other similar activities).

As explained in Chapter~\ref{sect:linksComplexClick}, the experience of optimal performance in sport has been extensively documented in the psychological literature of flow \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992,Jackson1995,Jackson1999,McNeill1995}.  Psychologists and neuroscientists have scientifically studied the experience of flow, and have tabled a series of neuropharmacological \citep{Boecker2008}, neurocognitive \citep{Dietrich2006,Dietrich2011,Labelle2013}, and psychological \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992} theories for its emergence.  The vast majority of flow research has focussed on the experience of the individual---the athlete, musician, or performer.  Some attempts have been made to extended an analysis of flow and its antecedents to the level of the group and dynamics of interpersonal coordination---a phenomenon termed ``group flow'' \citep{Sawyer2006}---but these attempts lack coherence and development.  Anecdote and observational evidence suggests that in addition to the components of flow already identified at the level of the individual, successful performance of technically complex
\textit{joint} action could have distinct psychological and social consequences.

In this thesis, I suggest that team click is distinct from flow in that it specifically delineates perceptions of joint action from individual action, and therefore implicates physiological, cognitive, and social mechanisms unique to joint action \citep{Vesper2010}.  In particular, team click in joint action entails an added level of complexity owing the the cognitive uncertainty inherent in coordinating behaviour with autonomous co-actors.  As I explain in more detail in the theoretical section below, there is evidence to suggest that the cognitive uncertainty of dynamic joint action may also be the source of social effects characteristic of social bonding, specifically when the uncertainty of joint action is mitigated via successful coordination of movement.

% the complexity systems dynamics associated with participating in a socially-coordinated, multi-agent system of physical movement \citep{Kelso2009,Riley2011}.

    %The experience of flow has by now been extensively studied by psychologists and neuroscientists, from which a series of neuropharmacological \citep{Boecker2008}, neurocognitive \citep{Dietrich2006,Dietrich2011,Labelle2013}, and psychological \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992} theories for its emergence have been tabled.  The vast majority of flow research has focussed on the experience of the individual---the athlete, musician, or performer.  Some attempts have been made to extended an analysis of flow and its antecedents to the level of the group and dynamics of interpersonal coordination---a phenomenon termed ``group flow'' \citep{Sawyer2006}---but these attempts lack coherence and development.

\subsection{Phenomenological components of team click}
It is possible to assume that the psychological phenomenon of team click will share many similarities with the visceral and autotelic components of experience associated with flow.  In addition, it is likely that team click will also involve an extra phenomenological dimension, owing to its inherently social features.  Team click is anecdotally present in a wide range of joint action contexts, and is often associated in these contexts with psychological processes of positive affect and wellbeing, as well as personal and social agency, social affiliation, and group membership \citep{Jackson1995,Marsh2009,Wheatley2012,Slingerland2014}.

Tightly synchronised activity in particular, found in team sports such as rowing, can help dissolve the boundaries between individual and social agency: ``In rowing...it feels like you have at your command the power of everybody else in the boat. You are exponentially magnified. What was a strain before becomes easier. It is absolutely the ultimate team sport'' \citep[x]{Brown2016}.
The blurring of agency between self and team may be responsible for facilitating affiliation and trust between teammates in competitive athletic environments such as professional rugby, which often involves high physiological stress and uncertainty.  As Jeremy Paul, a famous Australian Rugby player commented of his late teammate, Dan Vickerman: ``...you always wanted a guy who would go into the trenches with you and he always played consistently well...he could really play and was just one of the good lads that you enjoyed his company'' \citep{Fox-Sports2017}.  As this excerpt suggests, the experience of team click may act as a social diagnostic tool, whereby perceptions of successful performance with co-actors could drive attribution of social inferences of competence and reliability to co-actors.

The experience of team click, like flow, also often involves an experience of awe or exhilaration arising from perceptions of successful performance of joint action.  While elite athletes presumably always aim for optimal joint action, the experience of actually achieving that desired state, and even exceeding it---often with the help fo co-actors---appears to be a powerful, and somewhat ``surprising'' experience.  In the 1990s, psychologist Susan Jackson conducted a number of qualitative studies documenting athletes' (in this case elite figure skaters) experience of flow in solo and joint action

    \begin{quote}
      Oh, it's awesome! Everything's at peace...the crowd was involved, we were involved as a pair team, and we were just aware of everything, it just kept snowballing, like we weren’t going to miss, and it was great, it was an awesome experience \citep[168]{Jackson1992}.
    \end{quote}

Here, the athlete appears to be surprised and in awe of the achievement of optimal collective performance.  Part of the awesomeness may derive from the rare feeling of absolute alignment between self and co-actor(s):

    \begin{quote}
      What was really so special about this performance was that there was nothing between (partner's name) and I but flow.  You know, through the whole three minutes.  That meant that her mind and my mind were clear and in the same...in a partnership. It's always adjustments for ``Am I?'' and ``Are You?'' and ``Where Are We?'' and stuff like that.  That day was really a marriage of (partner) and (self) and the ice.  So I think it's a different kind of flow experience than a single skater who has much more control over themselves. \citep[173-4]{Jackson1992}.
    \end{quote}

This passage draws attention to the fact that joint action---more so than individual action---entails additional cognitive demands of attending to the movements and intentions of others \citep{Vesper2010}.  The achievement of click in joint action appears to be associated with the reduction or down-regulation of cognitively effortful processes of monitoring self and other contributions to joint action \citep{Dietrich2004b}. Research suggests that optimal coordination in joint action may be defined by a combination of patterns of fluent, ``co-confident'' movement \citep[in place of effortful monitoring; see]{Noy2015,Noy2017}, and a ``we-mode'' of social agency in which the contributions of ``you'' and ``I'' are momentarily transcended or abandoned \citep[see][]{Gallotti2013}.
The experience of team click could therefore be a powerful signal of shared commitment to joint action and willingness to cooperate \citep{Reddish2013a}. \\

In sum, team click refers to perceptions and experiences of peak team performance in group exercise contexts.  Based on this brief review of anecdote and evidence from psychology, anthropology, and further afield, an individual's perception of team click should contain some or all of the components outlined in Figure ~\ref{tab:teamClickComponents}.  Team click can involve tacit (rather than explicit) understanding between co-actors, experience of autotelic flow or coherence of joint action, a quality of aura or atmosphere around the team, a blurring of agency between self and teammates or group, and perception of reliability of others and self in performing their roles.  These six phenomenological components of team click can be reduced to two main dimensions: viscerality, and social agency.  As I develop in more detail in the theoretical section of this chapter, there is evidence to suggest that the combination of viscerality and social agency provide a cognitive template for processes of social affiliation and identification characteristic of social bonding.

\subsection{The theoretical challenge for a scientific understanding of team click}
Researchers have pointed out that flow---a concept that shares many similarities with team click---has traditionally escaped rigorous scientific analysis \citep{Dietrich2010a,Slingerland2014}.  Dietrich, for example, explains that flow presents a paradox that is difficult to explain according to traditional theories of attention and mental effort, which tend to assume better performance, on any task, is associated with increased conscious effort allocated to that task \citep{Dietrich2004b}.  As \textcite{Slingerland2014} surmises, flow reflects a paradox in which an individual in flow appears to be ``trying not to try.''  Flow appears to entail spectrum of both effortful (intentional, mental) and seemingly effortless (implicit, automatic) cognitions---some of which appear to depend on the resources beyond the brain.  Team click, like flow, is a multidimensional process involving mental, embodied, emotional, and social dimensions.  In this thesis, I consider the suggestion that the most effective way to reconcile the analytical paradox associated with flow, team click, and the mystery of group exercise more generally, is via a more dynamical and integrative model of cognition \citep{Clark2015}

In the sections that follow, I outline the building blocks necessary to formulate a novel theory of social bonding through joint action.  In particular, I review existing theory and research that suggests that the visceral and agentic dimensions of experience in team click are underwritten by a functional bi-directional link between dynamical coordination of physical movement and social communication in joint action.  The physical--social link in joint action is the groundwork that supports the hypothesis explored in this thesis, that more effective coordination of physical movement in joint action generates higher levels of social bonding.  In addition, I demonstrate how the unique parameters of complex coordination and physiological exertion in group exercise contexts create conditions conducive to high quality social bonding, especially when the team clicks.  Within this theory, team click is proposed as a mediating construct, through which the bonding effects of joint action can be causally explained.


%This passage demonstrates the key elements of distinction between the experience of click in solo and joint action. As I will explain in more detail below, joint action requires constant finessing (adjustments) of behaviours and intentions between co-participants in which individuals are consulting internal models of self, other, and joint action \citep{Pesquita2017}.

\section{A theoretical account of team click in group exercise}

To formulate a general account of team click in group exercise, I begin by developing a theoretical grounding for team click based on the proposed relationship between dynamical coordination of physical movement and social communication in joint action.  Emerging dynamical perspectives on social cognition suggest that positive perceptions of team performance in joint action and social bonding may be causally linked by an overarching mandate to reduce levels of uncertainty in joint action.  I suggest that the visceral and socially agentic experiences of team click can be explained as responses to instances of (unexpected) perceived success in team performance.  In particular, positive violation of expectations concerning team performance could set the foundation for experiences of agency and viscerality.  Finally, I present evidence to suggest that experiences of agency and viscerality characteristic of team click could provide a necessary sensorimotor template for more elaborate and culturally-mediated processes characteristic of social bonding.

Following this review, I formulate two sets of hypotheses: one set that accounts for a relationship between perceptions of team performance and social bonding mediated by team click (Hypothesis 1), and a second set that predicts positive expectation violation as an underlying mechanism linking evaluations of team performance and team click.  Specifically, higher levels of uncertainty in joint action will lead to higher levels of team click when team performance is perceived to be more successful relative to prior expectations (Hypothesis 2; see Section ~\ref{sect:hypotheses} for a full list of sub-hypotheses).




\subsection{Perceptions of team performance and social bonding are functionally linked by an overarching mandate to reduce uncertainty in joint action}

In this section I outline evidence that links dynamical coordination of physical movement and social communication in joint action.  This physical---social link serves as a foundation for a theory of social bonding through joint action in group exercise.

Emerging perspectives on social cognition suggest that positive perceptions of team performance in joint action and social bonding may be causally linked by an overarching mandate to reduce levels of uncertainty in joint action.  Humans are hyper-social \citep{Tomasello2012a}, to the extent that our capacities for social interaction---particularly those that are more basal and implicit---like physical movement coordination---have stabilised in as an often taken-for-granted aspect of our phenotypic repertoire \citep{Wheatley2016}.  It is important to realise, however, that successful coordination in joint action poses a cognitively improbable challenge, for which a suite of canny physiological and social mechanisms are required.

The uncertainty associated with coordinated physical movement in multi-component living systems was first described by neurophysiologist Nikolai \textcite{Bernstein1967}.  Bernstein noted that, in the case of human intra-personal movement, an impressive balance is somehow struct between flexibility, precision, and control, whereby hundreds of muscles and joints coordinate to perform many different tasks of everyday life.  When we grasp a cup or catch a ball, many individual muscles and joints---each with their individual degrees of freedom---work together in fine concert.  Bernstein found it unlikely, from a computational perspective, that the central nervous system would be able to finely control all the possible movements (the degrees of freedom) of each single muscle individually to create coherently directed movements---it would be computationally impossible.  Rather, he suggested that muscles and joints form  ``functional synergies''---flexible function-specific self-organising assemblies---by locally coupling and constraining each other’s degrees of freedom to greatly reduce the amount of control needed.  Thus, Bernstein predicted that successful action control would necessitate both dynamical mechanisms of physical movement coordination in concert with executive control functions.

The uncertainty inherent in joint action pose an even greater challenge to successful performance.  Intra-personal and interpersonal human movement both rely on the nervous system’s capacity to anticipate, attend, and adapt to the conditions of the environment \citep{Keller2014}.  In the case of intra-personal human movement, successful coordination is made possible by the nervous system's direct access to information concerning the spatiotemporal position of the body and its relationship to the environment.  Privileged access to this information enables habituated coupling of movement control system to the organism's various degrees of freedom, and therefore the emergence of self-organisng functional synergies \citep{Riley2011}.  By contrast, interpersonal movement coordination poses a much more significant challenge.  In the case of interpersonal coordination, the combination of 1) limited reliability of sensory modalities as a source of information about the action of others \citep{Wilson2005,Wolpert2003,Frith2007} and 2) the informational complexity associated with a cognitive system comprising multiple autonomous agents \citep[each with their own movement degrees of freedom; see][]{Turvey1978} predicts that successful performance in joint action will be defined by higher levels of uncertainty relative to successful performance of actions under individual control.

Cognitive scientist Natalie Sebanz and colleagues \citep{Sebanz2006,Vesper2010} have proposed that joint action requires individuals to adhere to the following minimal conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Represent a shared goal, as well as representing one’s own individual contribution to the shared goal.
  \item Apply monitoring and prediction processes to each partner’s actions. This includes monitoring the extent to which shared goals or tasks are being fulfilled while at the same time predicting a partner’s actions.
  \item Facilitate continuous coordination via coordination smoothing, defined as the process of continuously improving one’s prediction of the partner’s action.
\end{enumerate}


Considered from a dynamical perspective, the challenge associated with meeting these minimal requirements will vary as a function of the level of uncertainty in a given joint action scenario \citep{Turvey1982}.  Joint action scenarios subject to experimental analysis usually involve relatively low levels of uncertainty owing to their simplistic structure and task requirements.  The synchrony and social bonding literature, for example, usually involves simple dyadic manipulations of synchrony or joint action, so that variables of interest can be successfully operationalised and manipulated.  By contrast, many real-world joint action scenarios are striking for extremely high levels of uncertainty.  Real world joint action scenarios often involve many actors engaged in various hierarchically organised layers of nested joint goals over various spatiotemporal scales that, in turn, recruit various sensory modalities \citep{Keller2014}.

Above and beyond normal day-to-day instances of communication and exchange, joint action in group exercise is defined by extremely high levels of uncertainty.  Not only fo many group exercise scenarios such as group dancing or sport not only involve complex (multidimensional) joint action structures (layers, timescales, sensory modalities).  In addition, the on-line and ``in the moment'' demands of action executionm and even---in the case of interactional team sports---the presence of competition between co-actors \citep[whereby one individual or team of individuals actively attempts to foil or disrupt the actions of another individual or team of individuals;  see][]{Reimer2006}, serves to amplify uncertainty in joint action to the extreme.

In addition to these heightened cognitive challenges associated with joint action in group exercise, it has also been suggested that uncertainty in group exercise will be modulated indirectly via the neurocognitive effects of physiological exertion on brain function.  As Neuroscientist Arne Dietrich points out, physical exercise is at its core a stressor that will necessitate an energy tradeoff in the brain, whereby energetically costly brain regions inessential to movement execution are temporarily down-regulated \citep{Dietrich2004b}.\footnote{Dietrich suggests that experiences of flow and the ``runner's high'' in exercise could be the result of temporary down-regulation of energetically costly brain regions inessential to movement execution  \citep{Dietrich2004b}.  Dietrich and colleagues propose candidate areas of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responsible for self-monitoring and proprioceptive sensory attenuation \citep[commonly known as the ``inner critic'' regions of the brain, see][]{Limb2008}.}

As Bernstein pointed out, considering the uncertainty in joint action outlined above, it is unlikely that adherence to thee minimal requirements of representing, monitoring, and sustaining joint action could be driven solely by central, executive control processes in the central nervous system---joint action would be too slow and costly \citep{Dietrich2004b}.  It is similarly unlikely that processes of unconstrained automatic alignment (with no higher-level coordination) could possibly enable joint action of the type observed in humans \citep{Fusaroli2014}.  Rather, it seems more plausible that joint action is facilitated by a continuum of mechanisms spanning executive control through to more direct physical coupling with the environment \citep{Frith2008}.  Thus, it can be assumed that, based on the sheer uncertainty inherent in joint action (relative to individual action), successful performance will demand a suite of mechanisms---spanning both physical and social domains.

Indeed, existing evidence confirms the notion that physical and social processes in joint action are part of a continuum of cognitive strategies that work together to reduce uncertainty.  Humans display fine-tuned sensitivity to the quality of joint action and readily infer social significance from the outcomes of joint action ~\citep{Wheatley2016}.  As early as 1944, psychologists \textcite{Heider1944} demonstrated that complex social intensions and emotions could be deciphered from the motion trajectories of simple shapes.  Individuals readily extract social information (such as gender, emotion, and personality) from dynamic point-light displays \citep{Atkinson2004,Clark2005a,Johansson1973}.  Neuroscientific evidence suggests that auditory, visual, and biological motion
are processed by shared neural cortices \citep[e.g., the right superior temporal cortex; see][]{Zatorre2007,Beaucousin2007,Beauchamp2007}, and patients with aprosodia (inability to convey or interpret dynamical properties of speech) and amusia (the inability produce or interpret music) display correlated deficits in recognising gestures and facial expressions.  Taken together, these results suggest shared neural mechanisms for multisensory perception of dynamical motion and social communication \citep{Wheatley2012,Wheatley2016}, which could aid the the achievement of minimal requirements of joint action described above.

It has been hard to conceptualise the link between the two:
CR and MES -- focus on more explicit forms of communication.
In the following section, I introduce core tenets of an emerging paradigm within social cognition that enables the formulation of a theory of social bonding in joint action based on the way in which higher levels of uncertainty in joint action recruit more dynamical mechanisms of physical movement coordination, and more effective, efficient, and affective mechanisms of social communication.   This relationship---between uncertainty, dynamical coordination of physical movement, and social communication---sets the foundation for a a relationship between perceptions of success in team performance and social bonding, mediated by the phenomenon of team click.











\section{Joint action in group exercise \label{sect:JAinGE}}

Joint action in group exercise creates a unique environment for social cognition, defined by extreme levels of cognitive uncertainty.  Group exercise involves high cognitive load associated with complex joint action requirements involving many actors, many hierarchical layers of joint goals over various sensory modalities and spatiotemporal scales. The ``in the moment'' execution demands also constrain cognitive processing, and encourage a reliance on cognitive resources located in extra-neural and bio-external domains \citep{Bourbousson2016}.  In addition, strenuous physical exercise could also entail neurocognitive tradeoffs that further strain individual ability to reduce free energy in joint action \citep{Dietrich2004b}.

Evidence discussed above suggests that optimal solutions to joint action typical of group exercise may tend to favour the recruitment of more extra-neural resources as a way of minimising free energy, whereas less efficient solutions to joint action may rely on more computationally intensive procedures in order to reduce free energy (see Section ~\ref{sect:extraNeural}).  The social cognition of these processes in joint action have not yet been closely considered \citep[but see ][]{Marsh2009,Lumsden2012}.

    \subsection{Group exercise spikes uncertainty of joint action}

    \myparagraph{Group exercise involves multi-agent (and not just dyadic) joint action}
    Above and beyond normal day-to-day instances of communication and exchange, joint action in group exercise contexts such as sport place extreme cognitive load on participants. The active inference approach to joint action outlined above is based on preliminary models of dyadic joint action involving turn taking \citep[i.e., in bird song exchanges][]{Friston2015}.  Group exercise contexts, particularly modern sport contexts, often involve large numbers of co-participants, in either ``inter-active'' or ``co-active'' modes of coordination.
        \footnote{
        In co-active sports (e.g., bowling, archery), team members perform separately and the team outcome is a product of combined individual performances. In interactive sports (e.g., volleyball, soccer, rugby), goal accomplishment requires the establishment of complex patterns of interaction and coordination among team members \citep{Filho2014}.
        }
    Thus, achieving cognitive synchronisation in joint action of group exercise contexts may be much more difficult.  Evolutionary Anthropologist Robin Dunbar \textcite{Dunbar1992} proposes that the ratio of human neocortex size to total brain volume imposes an upper cognitive limit on real-time coordination of behaviour of approximately four to five individuals.  The sheer computational burden of modelling multiple agents in group exercise may place an unmanageable cognitive load on our normal healthy processes of active inference.  Indeed, at the very least, multi-agent joint action poses a challenge for the existing theoretical model for joint action (PJAM), which is formulated primarily based on dyadic interactions \citep{Pesquita2017}.


    \myparagraph{Joint action in group exercise is ``on-line'' and ``in-the-moment''}
    Particularly in the case of interactive team sports, interpersonal movement coordination is often executed ``on-line'' and ``in the moment,'' as opposed to step-by-step turn taking.  This fact poses a challenge to Friston and Frith's proposal that active inference in joint action comprises two modes (either actively attending to sensory stimuli, or else moving while in a state of sensory attenuation, see Section ~\ref{sect:activeInfJA} above).  Exactly what occurs when actors need to concurrently move and sense others moving at the same is poorly understood.  What happens to the precision weightings---the volume gauges---on proprioceptive, interoceptive, and exteroceptive prediction errors In instances of dynamic interactive joint action involving co-occurence of movement between agents in joint action?   What is the impact of on-line and in the moment join action on the experiences of agency in group exercise?  Empirical research is yet to provide answers to these questions.

    \myparagraph{Joint action in group exercise often involves competition}
    As if the cognitive load of multiple agents and on-line coordination of complex schemas for joint action was not enough for the humble human brain, interactional team sports also usually involves \textit{competition}.  While competition in sport is usually adorned with elaborate social meanings surrounding the ethics of winning and losing \citep{McNamee2008}, on a cognitive level, competition in joint action entails one individual or team of individuals actively attempting to foil or disrupt the predictive models of another individual or team of individuals \citep{Reimer2006}.  The competitive dimension of interactional team sports thus serves to further spike cognitive uncertainty between co-actors in joint action.  The uncertainty involved in competitive joint action scenarios could have further implications for the ability of second-order Bayesian inference concerning the reliability of sensory inputs \citep{Pezzulo2014}.

    \myparagraph{Group exercise involves metabolic tradeoffs in the brain}
    In addition to these heightened cognitive challenges associated with complex and dynamic joint action in group exercise, high levels of physiological exertion characteristic of group exercise could also serve to spike uncertainty.  Neuroscientist Arne Dietrich draws attention to the fact that physical exercise is at its core a stressor that places extreme energy demands the organism \citep{Dietrich2011}.
    Such a situation will necessitate an energy tradeoff in the brain, whereby energetically costly brain regions inessential to movement execution are temporarily downregulated \citep{Dietrich2004b}.  Dietrich suggests that experiences of flow and the ``runner's high'' in exercise could be the result of temporary downregulation of energetically costly brain regions inessential to movement execution  \citep{Dietrich2004b}.  Dietrich and colleagues propose candidate areas of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responsible for self-monitoring and proprioceptive sensory attenuation \citep[commonly known as the ``inner critic'' regions of the brain, see][]{Limb2008}.  It is currently not well understood precisely whether or how neurometabolic tradeoffs in the brain could impact upon joint action and the experience of team click.  However, it is conceivable that metabolic tradeoffs in the brain owing to prolonged physiological stress may have implications for the second-order inferential processes of precision weighting sensory inputs.









































\subsection{The active inference framework}
An emerging body of research in social cognition conceives of physical and social processes associated with action and perception as adhering to an overarching mandate---derived originally from non-equilibrium thermodynamics \citep{Schrodinger1944}—--of reducing uncertainty \citep[referred to as variational or information-theoretic free energy][]{Friston2015}.  Now commonly referred to as the active inference framework \citep[hereafter ``AIF''][]{Firston2006,Friston2010,Clark2015,Linson2018}, this emerging paradigm, now enlists the neurocomputational paradigm of predictive coding \citep[hereafter PC, see][]{Rao1999} in order to operationalise the concept of uncertainty
in the brain as a process of prediction error minimisation \citep{Clark2013}.  PC posits a dynamical and hierarchical process of ``generative modelling'' in which predictive ``forward models'' for action and perception, rather than being auxiliary to, are \textit{integrated} into action and perception \citep[as the instructions for action and perception themselves; for a more detailed review of Auxiliary Forward Models and Integrative Forward Models, see Appendix~\ref{app2:motorControl};]{Pickering2014}.  PC allows for the integration of traditionally disparate processes (e.g. physical, emotional, cognitive, or social) in one integrative inferential framework \citep{Clark2015}.

In a radical inverse of traditional models of cognition and motor control, in the PC framework, hypotheses concerning likely causes of sensory stimuli are adjudicated through an inferential process likened to ``empirical Bayes'' \citep{Clark2013}.  Hierarchical predictions are informed by three calculations: 1) prior experience, 2) available sensory evidence, and 3) precision-weighting---a second-order calculation of the relative precision or reliability of the available sensory evidence.  Second-order precision weighting of sensory evidence enables flexible direction of attention to prediction errors occurring at multiple levels of generative model (e.g. lower-order sensorimotor levels or higher-order perceptual or conceptual levels), and deriving from exteroceptive (relating to stimuli that are external to an organism, i.e. visual, auditory, haptic perception), interoceptive \citep[relating to stimuli produced within an organism, particularly by the body's organs (viscera) e.g., ``gut feelings,'' or elevated heart rate; see][]{Seth2013,FeldmanBarrett2015}, or ``proprioceptive'' information \citep[relating to stimuli that are produced and perceived within an organism, especially those connected with the position and movement of the body][]{Friston2011a}.  Iterative learning adjusts the precision weighting mechanism to strengthen prior probability distributions of models for future inference \citep{Robbins1964}.

In effect, second order Bayesian inference allows the brain to decide which prediction errors to pay attention to (e.g., exteroceptive or proprioceptive) at which level of the coding hierarchy \citep[for example, high and conceptual or deep and sensory][]{Friston2015}.  Each error signal is conditioned with a precision weighting, which functions to either ``dial-up'' or ``dial-down'' the volume on that signal's influence on the overall predictive model \citep{Clark2015}.  Precision weightings are proportional to the inverse variance of the model prior for each sensory input \citep{Ernst2004,FitzGerald2014}.  In other words, the volume of more reliable or more commonly encountered sensory inputs will be dialled-up; while the volume on less reliable or less commonly encountered sensory inputs will be dialled-down. This process of Bayesian precision weighting can be understood as the thermodynamic cognition's version of attention \citep{Ramstead2016}, which functions by selectively promoting certain predictions over others as a strategy to reduce overall uncertainty.

The AIF proposes a revitalisation of affordance theory \citep{Gibson1979} in order to theorise the role of extra-neural resources in affording more effective and elaborate strategies in uncertainty minimisation \citep{Friston2012}.  In essence, affordances can be understood as devices to which generative predictive models couple to reduce uncertainty.  Such affordances range in their complexity, from basal affordances of the immediate physical environment, through to cultural affordances which are coupled to more elaborate and culturally contingent processes \citep{Ramstead2016}  Research suggests that cultural norms function as affordances that smooth coordination via a shared referent for joint action \citep{Vesper2017}.  Taken together, these proposals offer a conceptualisation of the way in which features of a specific activity or cultural context can reliably pattern and shape human experience of joint action, without necessarily fundamentally altering cognitive and evolutionary principles based on universally shared genetic basis \citep{Roepstorff2010}.

To summarise, the AIF proposes that physical and social processes in joint action are linked as part of a continuum of strategies that adhere to an overarching mandate of reducing uncertainty.  Traditionally-termed lower cognitive processes of physical movement regulation form the base layer of hierarchically organised predictive models, while traditionally-termed higher order cognitive processes associated with declarative language form the higher layers of the same model, given that the model successfully serves to reduce uncertainty \citep[over the lifespan of the organism][]{Ramstead2017}.  Thus, in the case of joint action, more successful models will be those which successfully reduce uncertainty through a coordinated (i.e., hierarchically organised) assemblage of both physical and social strategies, engaging neural, physical, and cultural affordances \citep{Clark2015}.  The AIF proposes a radical reconceptualisation of cognition such that physical and social processes are collapsed into one inferential framework.

In so doing, the AIF provides a formal theory through which to test the proposition---substantiated by anecdotal and empirical evidence---that more positive perceptions of team performance in joint action generate experiences characteristic of team click and social bonding.  In essence, the AIF predictions that when uncertainty in joint action in high, successful performance will necessitate more effective and efficient mechanisms of movement coordination, which will in turn facilitate higher quality social communication characteristic of social bonding.  Below, I review evidence that substantiates the interlocking of physical and social mechanisms as two ends of a cognitive continuum designed---through processes of ontogeny and phylogeny---to reduce uncertainty in humans' thoroughly social evolutionary niche \citep{Ramstead2017}.



\subsubsection{Was it a thief or just the wind?\label{sect:windThief}}
In this subsection, I provide a contrived example to help develop an intuition for the AIF (\textit{Readers more familiar with the AIF may skip this section}).

Consider the following example used by cognitive scientist Giovanni \textcite{Pezzulo2013}.  Imagine you wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of your bedroom window creaking.  At the higher levels of the predictive coding architecture, competing perceptual hypotheses emerge to explain the likely causes of the sensory experience.  For simplicity, assume that two plausible hypotheses emerge: 1) the wind outside caused the window to creak (wind), or 2) a thief is trying to break in to your house (thief).  The probability that the sensory experience of the window creaking is due to the wind can be represented by the equation in Figure ~\ref{fig:windThief}.  The predictive coding proposal is that the brain formulates a probability estimate based on:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(wind)$: the model \textit{prior} formulated by previous experience (e.g., it has been windy at night recently, or in the case of $P(thief)$, there have been some recent thefts in the neighbourhood)
\item $P(evidence|wind)$: the \textit{likelihood} that the sensory experience is caused by the wind (this value could be informed by other sources of information, e.g., the trees outside are also rustling, the dog is not barking (which may be the case if it were a thief, ($P(evidence|thief)$)
\item Precision weighting: the reliability or certainty associated with your sensory inputs (it is dark in your room and so you may not trust your visual perception, you just woke up so could have been dreaming, etc.).  The precision weight is factored into the ``evidence.''
\end{enumerate}

      \begin{figure}[htbp]
      \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=.5]{images/windThief.png}
        \caption{Bayesian model for the prediction of wind as the cause of the window creaking. Source: Pezzulo (2014)}
          \label{fig:windThief}
      \end{center}
      \end{figure}

These two hypotheses (wind and thief) effectively compete on the basis of how well they explain the sensory stimuli.  The brain's capacity to quantify the uncertainty (precision) of any given sensory state facilitates optimal selection between competing predictions pertaining to the same bottom-up sensory signals.  In this example, based on the the priors ($P(wind) = .8$ (it has been windy recently) and $P(thief) = .2$ (no recent reports of theft)), and the (precision-weighted) evidence ($P(evidence|wind) = .6$ and $P(evidence|wind) = .5$ (roughly equivalent because it is dark and you have just woken up), the probability of wind ($= .8276$) is much higher than the probability of thief ($= .1724$).  In this case, the prediction that wind caused the window to creak wins out, and guides action and perception accordingly (you decide to go back to sleep).

What makes the AIF ``active''?  Original models of PC dealt primarily with ``exteroceptive'' information \citep[relating to stimuli that are external to an organism, i.e. visual, auditory, haptic perception][]{Rao1999,Friston2010}.  In the wind vs. thief model considered above, only exteroceptive evidence is considered, in the form of the auditory stimulus of the window creaking.  Research has since demonstrated that the PC approach can also account for ``proprioceptive'' information (relating to stimuli that are produced and perceived within an organism, especially those connected with the position and movement of the body), as well as ``interoceptive'' information  \citep[relating to stimuli produced within an organism, particularly by the body's organs (viscera) e.g., ``gut feelings,'' or elevated heart rate; see][]{Seth2013,FeldmanBarrett2015}.  Incorporating proprioceptive and interoceptive information sources into PC allows researchers to theoretically demonstrate that human cognition is both ``embodied''---inference is rooted in and contingent upon visceral, interoceptive information \citep[][]{Pezzulo2014}, as well as ``active''---in the sense that humans can rely on physical movement to reduce the discrepancy between proprioceptive predictions and actual body states, and thereby reduce free energy \citep[see][]{Friston2010,Clark2015}.  In the case of motor systems, agents like humans are able to move their sensors in ways that amount to actively seeking or generating the sensory consequences that they (or rather, their generative models) expect \citep[][1349]{Friston2003}.

Consider an ``active'' revision of the wind vs. thief example.  Two key differences in the model become apparent.  First, the evidence considered is broadened to include both interoceptive and proprioceptive information, in addition to exteroceptive evidence.  Assume that before you went to bed you just watched a horror movie, and when you woke up to the sound of a window creaking your heart began to pound and you immediately fixated on the hypothesis that a thief was causing your window to creak.  Fixation on the thief hypothesis can be explained by the contribution of interoceptive information (e.g., autonomic stress response, heart beat, etc.) to sensory the evidence \citep{Pezzulo2014}.  In addition, the incorporation of proprioceptive information into the model (for example, the possibility of moving to turn on the bed-side lamp) creates additional cognitive affordances through which higher level predictions could be strengthened (or free energy can be minimised).  This difference in the model demonstrates how perception, emotion, and action are functionally integrated in human cognition.

Second, broadening sensory inputs in the model also introduces the problem of differential reliability of sensory inputs.  The wind vs. thief example describes a situation in which exteroceptive information is relatively unreliable: it is dark, so visual inputs are restricted, and what you heard is unreliable because you just woke up and maybe it was part of a dream.  By contrast, interoceptive information is usually quite certain: you can be certain that your heart is pounding and that you feel unnerved.  In this particular case, interoceptive inputs may have a greater influence on the overall inference due to their reliability.  As explained above, evidence suggests that the brain deals with multiple sensory inputs via a process of ``Bayesian multisensory integration'' \citep{Ernst2004}, with the reliability of each sensory input proportional to the inverse of its variance.  In the wind vs. thief example, the interoceptive information from your body will be precision-weighted as the most reliable source, and will likely tip the balance of the model to favour the hypothesis that it is a thief.  If this is indeed the case, and you fixate on the thief hypothesis, you will move your body in a way so as to reconcile the discrepancy between proprioceptive predictions that also correspond to the thief hypothesis (and therefore also tuned to a higher volume in the model).  The result of this trajectory of action and perception may be that you act by turning on your bedside lamp \citep{Pezzulo2014}.















\subsection{Successful performance in joint action is facilitated by a link between dynamical coordination of physical movement and social communication}

The AIF predicts that successful performance in joint action will entail the flexible deployment of various hierarchically organised cognitive strategies designed to reduce uncertainty.  In particular, evidence suggests that, in joint action scenarios defined by higher uncertainty, more successful coordination of physical movement sets a sensorimotor foundation for more efficient, fluent, and rewarding social connection, and vice versa.  In this section, I argue that the implication of this line of research is that, under conditions of higher uncertainty in joint action, higher levels of successful performance should facilitate higher levels of social connection, i.e., social bonding.

\myparagraph{Successful performance in joint action is associated with functional interpersonal synergies and action-perception coupling}
``Functional synergies'' are known to exist on multiple levels of human behaviour, from brain function \citep{Yufik1998,Sengupta2013}, to interpersonal interactions \citep{Kelso2009,Riley2011,Fusaroli2014}, to large-scale human societal dynamics \citep{Nowak2017}. This cross-sectional evidence   suggests that functional synergies can function as effective and adaptive solutions to uncertainty inherent in multi-component or multi-agent interactions across multiple biological timescales \citep{Kelso2013}.

There is evidence to suggest that functional synergies in joint action facilitate successful performance by reducing uncertainty and facilitating social communication in joint action.  In joint action, functional (interpersonal) synergies (FIS) are defined by instances in which movement degrees of freedom of a multi-component system couple together to 1) reduce (or ``compress'') the number of overall dimensions of the system and 2) increase reciprocal compensation \citep[the ability of one component of a synergy to react to changes in others; see][]{Riley2011}. Evidence supports the existence of FIS in real-world joint action tasks, ranging from ensemble music performance \citep{Keller2012,Miyata2017}, dancing \citep{Chauvigne2017}, martial arts \citep{Schmidt2012}, to team sports \citep{Duarte2012,Passos2014}.\footnote{In these studies, specific component degrees of freedom are modelled as coupled oscillators \citep[using the HKB model, which describes the change in the relative phase between two oscillatory components.   See][]{Haken1985,Kelso1986}.  Models are analysed for non-random fluctuations in relative phase over multiple time scales.  This type of synchronisation is said to be of a fractal or semi-fractal organisation, also known as 1/f scaling or ``pink noise'' \citep{Caron2017}.}

The suggestion that performance in joint action is aided by  uncertainty-reducing FIS is supported by research showing that direct action-perception links between co-actors facilitates enhanced prediction and communication in joint action \citep{Novembre2014}.  Parallel strands of research in psychology \citep{Prinz1990,Prinz1997,Prinz2013}, neurophysiology \citep{Rizzolatti2004,Rizzolatti2010}, and neurocognition \citep{Wolpert1998,Wolpert2000} indicate that interpersonal behavioural coordination in joint action is facilitated by the intrinsic coupling—--under certain circumstances---of action perception and action execution in the human brain.  Action perception links refer to the representation of a perceptual effect (say the sound of a middle-C on a piano) can trigger the movement necessary to produce the effect itself (motor instructions for playing the middle-C key on a piano).  Importantly, evidence suggests that sensory-motor coupling emerges primarily as a result of motor learning: having only visual \citep{Candidi2014} or auditory \citep{Lahav2007} experience with a given action is not sufficient to trigger these motor responses—--active motor learning is necessary.  As such, most research into action-perception coupling occurs with individuals who have mastered a certain sensorimotor task, such as expert musicians, whose movements and intended sounds become strongly associated \citep{Novembre2014}.  In terms of its function for joint action scenarios, action-perception coupling is regarded as a basic link between sender and receiver that provides procedural, perceptual, and emotional common ground between individuals \citep{Rizzolatti1998}.

In behavioural experiments in which samples of musicians are compared to non-musician controls, researchers demonstrate that auditory perception primes action if strong action-perception links have been established through instrument-specific training \citep{Drost2005,Drost2005a,Drost2007}.  For example, Drost and colleagues showed that sound cues incongruent with the prescribed action response (the sound cue of a D chord when the prescribed action response is a C chord) delayed execution time \citep{Drost2005} and induced more false responses \citep[i.e., production of the heard chord, instead of the imperative one,][]{Drost2005a} in pianists but not non-pianists.  \textcite{Keller2006} showed that mental images of anticipated action effects can prime responses to a similar degree as is observed with congruent and incongruent sounds, highlighting the role of action-perception coupling in action preplanning (i.e., before sounds are actually perceived).  Further studies demonstrated that action-perception coupling does not only enhance the efficiency of action planning, but also facilitates timing accuracy and economical force control by optimising movement kinematics \citep{Keller2010}.

It has been argued that action-perception coupling supports a neurophysiological capacity to anticipate our own as well as other's  (i.e., observed) actions. \textcite{Maidhof2009} and \textcite{Ruiz2009} conducted two similar EEG studies in which they examined the ERPs preceding the execution of piano errors in pianists and non-musicians.  In pianists (but not non-musicians) errors were detected prior to their execution (the EEG signal was found to anticipate the actual mistake by 100 ms \citep{Maidhof2009} and 50–70 ms \citep{Ruiz009}.  These data indicate that the coupling of sensory and motor cortices has a strong anticipatory function that, given the existence of an association between movements and their ensuing effects, permits the generation of predictions about the state of our own body and the sensory consequences of our movements.  In addition,  action-perception links can be used for monitoring and integrating (e.g., timing or combined pitches) the actions of other ensemble members with self-generated actions \citep{Loehr2013}, and these effects appear to be stronger in individuals with high perspective taking skills \citep{Novembre2012,Loehr2013}.  The overlap between mechanisms for action production and action observation suggests that individuals may represent their own and others' actions in a commensurable format.  Training-induced motoric representation of self and other actions may thus facilitate various capacities important for joint action, such as prediction, adaptation, and entrainment.

Studies of highly skilled practitioners in joint action demonstrate that more technically competent practitioners generate more accurate predictive models for joint action than less technically competent practitioners \citep{Tomeo2012,Aglioti2008,Mulligan2016}.   In studies involving skilled versus non-skilled practitioners in dyadic interactions, it has been shown that more skilled practitioners create stronger dynamical coupling through flexibly modulating their actions with others \citep{Schmidt2011,Caron2017}. These findings are corroborated by other studies that find that professional footballers (versus novice controls) are able to more accurately predict the direction of a kick from another player's body kinematics (\cite{Tomeo2012}, see also \cite{Aglioti2008,Mulligan2016} for similar results with basketball and dart players).



\myparagraph{FIS and action-perception links facilitate social communication}

In line with the predictions fo the AIF, evidence suggests that mechanisms of dynamical coordination of physical movement facilitate strategies for social communication, which in turn enables successful performance in joint action.  Experimental evidence has shown that FIS facilitate performance of social cognitive or linguistic tasks, such as gaze coordination and turn taking in conversation \citep{Miles2010,Richardson2005,Shockley2009}.  Conversely, being psychologically distanced from another individual can inhibit the emergence of interpersonal synergies \citep{Miles2010}.

Evidence relating to the movement signatures of functional interpersonal synergies suggests that the successful dynamical coupling of movement could be responsible for feelings of being ``in the zone'' with a co-actor.  Working within the common dyadic ``mirror game'' paradigm, Noy and colleagues \textcite{Noy2011,Noy2015,Hart2014} have developed an experimental proxy for an optimal state of togetherness in joint action.  ``Co-confident motion'' (CC motion) is canonical movement pattern of synchronised motion characterised by smooth and jitter-less motion, without the typical jitter resulting from reactive control in more commonly encountered leader-follower patterns.  In CC motion, different players appear to shift their basic motion signatures to a movement shape that is altogether different from their individually preferred shapes \citep{Hart2014}. Importantly, the pattern of CC motion shares the same sine wave shape as the optimal solution of the minimum jerk model, a well-known motor control model for rhythmic motion \citep{Hogan2007}.  Furthermore, participants appear to use smooth elementary strokes of CC motion as the building blocks for more complex motion \citep{Noy2017}. Noy and colleagues suggest that it is possible that during CC motion periods of joint action, two players converge to a canonical pattern stemming from an optimal state of each participant’s motor control system.  The resulting motion may be easier to predict and to agree on.

This observation raises the possibility that CC motion, a state of alignment in which individual components converge in a transcendent, functional synergy, could set the cognitive foundation for more efficient and effective higher level processes of communication and information transfer \citep[15]{Lerique2016}.  This evidence accords with the proposal that joint action is underwritten by the fact that two or more agents share functionally and formally equivalent ``shared narrative'' that transcend self and other agency, and instead involve a ``we'' mode of social cognition \citep{Gallotti2013}.


%1. F:Coupling and action-perception leads to enhanced prediction and information sharing (Fusaroli), performance (rocking chair etch-a-sketch?), and liking (Marsh2009), and shared agency


An accumulation of evidence suggests that action-perception links facilitate processes of co-representation, which in turn facilitate accurate attribution of self and other agency in joint action. Agency refers to the feeling of control (attributed to self, other, and/or group) over actions and their consequences \citep{Moore2016}. The perception agency in joint action can thus be understood as a social inferential process with roots in sensorimotor (physical) processes. Agency enables the delineation of roles in joint action and effective routing of sensory information for inference and action-execution \citep{Sato2008,Friston2015,Kelso2016}.  Experimental evidence suggests that co-actors generate internal models of self and other either spontaneously and involuntarily---as in the commonly used social simon task experimental paradigm \citep{Sebanz2003,Atmaca2008}---or more deliberately---as in a coordinated dyadic horizontal jumping task \citep{Vesper2012}.  Studies also show that the capacity for co-representation of self and other action plans is modulated by mood \citep[positive or negative affect, see][]{Kuhbandner2010}, self-concept and social orientation \citep{Colzato2012,Colzato2012a}, and processes of group membership \citep{DeBruijn2008,Aquino2015}. This evidence lends support to the proposal that active inference involves coupling with various natural and conventional affordances in order to flexibly integrate information deriving form various sensory inputs.

Beyond immediate linkages between sensorimotor mechanisms engaged in physical coordination and attributions causation (agency) in joint action, evidence suggests that individuals also generate ``type-based'' social evaluations of self and others in order to reduce uncertainty \citep{Moutoussi2014}.  It is well established in psychology that that people automatically prescribe beliefs and traits to self, other, and the target social group based on 1) perceived to social outcomes of joint action (e.g., ``success'' or ``failure''), 2) perceived capabilities in joint action (e.g.,``weak'' or ``talented'') and 3) perceived preferences for acting \citep[e.g., ``good,'' ``fair,'' or ``trustworthy'';][]{Bem1967,Fowler2006}.  Clinical interpretations of this line of research has suggested a functional role for self-representation (i.e., self-esteem) as an indicator of one's likely social evaluation by the social milieu \citep{Leary1995}. From the perspective of the AIF, self evaluations of this nature function as useful heuristics that serve to drastically reduce the computational burden associated with prediction movement coordination in joint action \citep{Moutoussis2011}.  Conversely, an inability to generate functional perceptions of agency and type-based evaluations has been associated with mental health disorders such as ASL \citep{Frith2015}, Schizophrenia \citep{Frith2007}, and Depression \citep{Moutoussis2011}.

In addition to attribution of agency and performance of type-based evaluations of self and others communication via cultural affordances also appears to function as a heuristic for reducing uncertainty.    In the context of joint action in particular, cultural conventions can be understood as shared frames of reference that set the macro-contextual coordinates for joint action \citep{Clark2013}.  Joint actions that involve complex sequences and divisions of labour between participants appear to rely heavily on capacities to explicitly signal intention for the assigning of roles, forward planning, and repair of failed coordination \citep{Frith2010}.  These ``coordination smoothers'' \citep{Vesper2017} often function to reduce spatial and temporal variation in action by providing a shared spatiotemporal referent for co-alignment of predictions.  Depending on the context of the joint action, it could be subject to a pre-existing, mutually recognised power relations typical in the established culture (e.g., favouring hierarchical or egalitarian communication, \citep[see]{Cheon2011}) and the particular situational context (e.g., formal or informal).  Establishing roles, such as leader or follower, also has a similar smoothing effect, and often the affordances in the task environment shape the smoothing strategies available to co-actors \citep{Marsh2009}.  The AIF predicts that coupling of lower levels of generative models via mechanisms of FIS and action perception links will facilitate reinforcement of higher levels of the same models dedicated social communication, such as attributing agency, making type-based evaluations of self and others, and utilising shared cultural affordances as heuristics for computationally tractable performance in joint action.

To summarise, in this section I reviewed evidence to suggest that the observable link between perceptions of successful team performance and social bonding in group exercise can be most productively understood from the perspective of uncertainty.  The emerging AIF suggests that instances of dynamical coordination of physical movement---such as those identified in FIS and action-perception links between skilful practitioners---and processes of social communication, including attributions of agency and performance evaluations of self and others, and mutual recognition of shared cultural affordances are functionally connected by an overarching mandate to minimise uncertainty in exchanges with the environment.  In this conception, mechanisms that facilitate successful physical strategies of coordination will also facilitate successful social strategies of communication, and vice-versa.  In effect, physical and social mechanisms work together to help manage the uncertainty inherent in joint action (relative to individual action).


Taken together, this evidence suggests a that successful performance of joint action will be underwritten by an association between dynamical mechanisms of physical coordination (e.g., FIS and action-perception coupling) and social communication.  The implication that flows from this body of work is that, in joint action scenarios involving higher uncertainty, more successful perceptions of performance could generate perceptions social bonding.  As I discuss in the following section, team click may be a necessary mediatory phenomenon in this process.  The visceral and socially agentic experience of team click may offer the crucial ingredients conducive to more elaborate and culturally contingent processes characteristic of social bonding.





%Thus, The bi-directional link between dynamical coordination of physical movement and and social communication can serve as a theoretical foundation for an hypothesised relationship between perceptions of successful team performance and social bonding in group exercise.  In particular,

%While the social bonding effects of joint action have been reliably demonstrated in the synchrony literature, very few of these studies have manipulated uncertainty of joint action, while maintaining (successful) performance constant.  As I discuss in the next section, uncertainty in joint action appears to play an important role in processes of sensory attenuation and integration that, in turn, appear to bear upon perceptions of agency and viscerality.









\subsection{Theoretical substantiation for the visceral and agentic foundations of team click}

Theory outlined in this section supports two core claims of the general account of team click in group exercise.  The first claim is that perceptions of successful team performance are associated with perceptions characteristic of team click, namely, viscerality and social agency.  In turn, evidence also suggests that these same perceptions may provide a foundation for higher order processes characteristic of social bonding.

In addition to these two core claims, I identify positive violation of expectations concerning team performance as a potential mechanism for explaining the link between perceptions of team performance and team click.  When uncertainty in joint action is high---as it invariably is in group exercise contexts---expectations concerning successful team performance will be inherently low, which will result in more positive expectations of violations concerning team performance when performance is deemed to be successful. More heightened and positively valenced attention to team performance resulting from more positive violations of expectations could serve as an precedent for team click and, in turn, social bonding.

As an added consideration, research also suggests that a relationship between perceptions of team performance, team click, and social bonding may be moderated by individual variation in technical and social competence.  In the case of joint action scenarios involving highly technical demands, such as music making and sport, an individual's level of technical competence may constrain an ability to achieve physical coordination and social connection with co-actors. In addition, an individual's social and communicative dispositions and preferences, expressed in constructs such as personality type, may also impact upon the social effects of joint action.  However, while I make note of these possibilities, existing research does not motivate the dedicated testing of these concepts in this thesis.

% Team click may be underwritten by positive expectation violation, whereby higher levels of uncertainty in joint action facilitate lower expectations concerning the likelihood of successful team performance, which leads to more positive violations of expectations when team performance is ultimately evaluated as successful.


\subsubsection{Positive perceptions of team performance are associated with experiences of viscerality and social agency}

%Experiences of viscerality and social agency deriving from positive perceptions of team performance can be explained by the ways in which uncertainty bears upon processes of sensory attenuation and integration during joint action.

Empirical evidence and sporting anecdote mentioned in Section ~\ref{} above indicates that team click is associated with an experience of social agency in which the distinction between individual and other agency is blurred. such that individuals feel that their individual agency is extended by the abilities of others.  What's more, athletes feel a level of certainty concerning the ability of self and others to contribute successfully to team performance.  In addition, team click is associated with perceptions of tacit understanding between teammates, or an atmosphere or aura surrounding the team. In addition, athletes may experience team performance action as flowing and coherent \citep{Jackson1998b}.  What cognitive mechanisms can account for these experiences?

Evidence suggests that experiences of social agency and viscerality associated with evaluations of performance in exercise can be explained in terms of the ways in which uncertainty in joint action bears upon processes of sensory attenuation and integration \citep{Seth2013,Pezzulo2014}.  In brief, uncertainty in joint action appears to impact on individuals' ability to optimally integrate sensory information deriving from the actions of others and the external environment, which has consequences for processes such as attribution of agency and evaluations of the performance of self and others in joint action.


\myparagraph{Uncertainty surrounding team performance is associated with (mis)attribution of agency}
Existing empirical evidence suggests an inverse relationship between uncertainty in joint action and attributions of agency, such that more predictable action affords more reliable and accurate attributions of agency.  Research has shown that agency in action is strongly correlated with an individual's ability to anticipate individual contribution to action.  For example, \textcite{Sato2008} and colleagues demonstrated that discrepancy between prediction and sensory input can alter the experience of agency: unpredicted sensory input can lead to ascribing agency for that input to an external source, for example, other participants in joint action or the external environment \citep{Sato2005,Frith2007}.  It is generally understood that this result can be explained by by the role of sensory attenuation that reliably occurs when individuals anticipate action:  researchers have shown a strong correlation between attenuation of proprioception (predictions relating to individual contribution to action) and experiences of self agency \citep{Wolpert2003,Sato2008}, as well as an inverse correlation between sensory attenuation and ascribing agency to sources external to the self \citep{Brown2013}.  As has been well documented in the case of schizophrenia, attribution of agency in social interaction may be modulated by individual variation in ``locus of control'' (the degree to which events are perceived to result from one's own actions or not), and this may be related to improper function of the parietal cortex \citep{Frith2000}.
Thus, here, individual variation in dispositions for social interaction appears to be important to perceptions of agency in joint action.

Research addressing the question of how people experience agency or other social inferences in actions they intentionally produce in coordination with others (joint agency) is less abundant \citep[but see][]{VanderWel2012,VanderWel2013}.  \textcite{VanderWel2012}, for example, argue for \textit{consistency} between action and the original intention as the most important condition for attribution of agency in joint action.  The authors present results of a study in which perceptions of self agency do not decrease when an individual transfers from performing a solo action to performing the same action with a partner.  Individuals do, however, experience a boost in agency when they transfer from performing a joint action to the same action solo, suggesting that this transfer may induce enhanced consistency owing to the greater reliability of predictions pertaining to action that is individually controlled \citep{VanderWel2012}.

- While research has dealt with X
- To my to my knowledge at the time of writing, no research has addressed the question of how individuals experience a boost in agency resulting from unexpected contributions of others to joint action.  - This gap in the literature around perceptions of unexpected shared agency demands further empirical investigation.
- Limitations of existing theory.

Drawing upon the proposed relationship between uncertainty and attribution of agency \citep{Frith2007}, it is possible that less predictable (less likely) performance outcomes in joint action will facilitate attributions of higher levels of agency to sources external to the self when (unexpected) performance outcomes come to fruition \citep{Sato2005}.  Due to the uncertainty inherent in joint action characteristic of group exercise, it can be expected that predictions concerning successful team performance will be low; individuals will face difficulties accurately modelling the contributions of others (and self) to joint action, and will subsequently---in the language of the AIF---dial down the volume of prediction errors deriving from team components of performance. In instances in which team performance is successful, attributions of agency to the team will be encouraged.

Here, it is worth noting that positive expectation of violation concerning team performance appears to be an important preceding mechanism to the experience of social agency in joint action. As I explain in the next section, positive expectation violation concerning team performance also appears to be relevant to proposals concerning the experience of viscerality in joint action.


\myparagraph{Uncertainty surrounding team performance is associated with perceptions of viscerality}
Viewed from a dynamical perspective, experiences of viscerality associated with successful team performance (such as experiences of tacit understanding, team aura, and flow) will arise when information available to individuals to evaluate team performance is limited to interoceptive and proprioceptive (as opposed to exteroceptive) inputs \citep{Pezzulo}.  The uncertainty of dynamic joint action scenarios often involves constraints on availability of sensory information, particularly concerning the actions and intentions of others.  According to the theory of Bayesian multisensory integration \cite{}, it can be expected that individuals in joint action will dial-down the volume on prediction errors pertaining to exteroceptive inputs (e.g., the contributions of others to team performance) and dial-up the volume of interoceptive and proprioceptive inputs (those most reliable in an otherwise uncertain terrain of sensory inputs).

%However, in the case of dynamic joint action involving action and perception will need to attenuate proprioceptive predictions during action execution,

The relationship between perceptions of successful team performance and viscerality can be best explained through a return to the wind vs thief example mentioned above.  In some respects, waking up in a dark room in the middle of the night is not too dissimilar to taking the rugby field: exteroceptive information will be less reliable than information generated internally, via interoceptive and proprioceptive inputs. As such, it could be predicted that the interoceptive and proprioceptive inputs to the total evidence will be weighted more reliable than exteroceptive inputs.
Second, consider that group exercise requires constant execution of movement, contemporaneous with the movement of others. As discussed above, movement requires the attenuation of proprioceptive information (so as not to interrupt the flow of movement itself). Thus, it can be predicted that the volume on proprioceptive error signals will at times be turned down low, at least while participants are executing movement. There may need to be some optimal tradeoff here, in which the volume is not turned down too low, so as to keep track of the movements of others while moving \citep{Pesquita2017}.  In this situation, with the volume on exteroceptive information turned down, and proprioceptive inputs attenuated to allow for movement, it can be seen that interoceptive inputs could enjoy the most precision of all available sensory sources. This situation could conceivably explain the tacit ``gut feel'' of team click.  Interoceptive information could therefore provide an embodied grounding for the viscerality of team click.

To my knowledge, no research has attempted to directly tested the role of uncertainty in joint action on evaluations of task performance or perceptions of experiences of agency or and viscerality.



\subsubsection{Potential preceding mechanism: Positive violation of expectations concerning team performance}

As noted above, positive expectation violation appears to precede both perceptions of social agency and viscerality in joint action. There is evidence to suggest that expectation violation could be an important precedent to click, due to the way in which violations of expectation  appear to function in the AIF to direct attention.

It is now well understood in cognitive neuroscience that positive and negative affect associated with prediction errors (expectation violations) function as important mechanisms in the regulation of behaviour.  There is evidence to suggest that affect serves as feedback for prediction errors.  Cortical processes of prediction error management appear to be mediated by the activity of the dopaminergic system \citep{Schultz2016}, while subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as those responsible for producing norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and endogenous opioids, appear to be involved in attuning cortical processing to signals from the body and environment that are important for survival \citep{Lewis2005}.  There is now evidence to suggest that complex cognitive processes (traditionally understood to be confined to cortical regions) and subcortical neuromodulatory systems (traditionally understood to be responsible only for affective response and exogenous to the brain’s inferential processes) work in a loop of reciprocal interaction in order to enhance processes of error management \citep{Damasio1994,Lewis2005,Miller2017,Barrett2017}.

It is generally assumed that affective feedback following prediction errors should strike a neuroeconomic balance between rewarding and encouraging exploitation of accurate predictions, and exploring novel environments of uncertainty \citep{Chetverikov2014}.  Recently, \textcite{Chetverikov2016} have proposed a model for affective feedback in the AIF, in which affective feedback is weighted with the inverse prior probability of the prediction, so that more probable predictions on balance receive \textit{less} positive feedback.  In other words, confirmation of more probable predictions yields less positive feedback than confirmed less probable predictions.  By contrast, less likely outcomes will be weighted with higher affective reward. In this proposal, the authors demonstrate how the AIF serves to explain away the ``dark room dilemma'' associated with traditional (non-dynamical) models theories of prediction error management  \citep{Friston2012}.

In the wind vs thief example, in which $p(thief)=.2$ and $p(wind)=.8$, the level of surprise attributed to the confirmation of the thief hypothesis would be .8 (whereas the wind hypothesis would be only .2). In this case, however, the surprise associated with encountering a thief would likely not be experienced as pleasant. In the case of team click, by contrast, the reward associated with successful joint action appears to be positively valenced surprise. As already mentioned, it is likely that the lower probability of team performance success in joint action could to generate relatively high levels of positive affective feedback when team performance is perceived to be successful.

To extend this interpretation of the joint agency study conducted by van der Well colleagues (2012), it is possible that individuals experienced a boost in individual agency over action owing to more positive violations concerning (individual) performance in action relative to prior expectations for action control \citep[developed in the previous task in which their control over action was shared with another participant;][]{VanderWel2012}.  As I will explain in more detail below, positive expectation violation resulting from unexpected but (but desirable) outcomes in joint action appears to be underwritten by neuroeconomic

Individual variation according to technical competence: Less technically competent and or less experienced athletes might experience more volatile surprise (both positively and negatively valenced), owing to the high variance of prior probability distributions owing to a poverty of experience and precision in their inferential models pertaining to
Also baseline levels of conservatism or personality





\subsubsection{Theoretical substantiation for the social bonding effects of team click}

In the previous section I use the AIF to formulate predictions concerning how joint action can be responsible for the visceral and socially agentic dimensions of team click. In this section, I substantiate a relationship between perceptions of team click and perceptions of social bonding.  Social bonding in joint action includes perceptions of emotional support, common goal \citep[see][]{Dunbar2012,Wolf2015}, and shared social identity between co-actors \citep{Whitehouse2014}.  Here, as with previous sections of this theoretical review, the relationship between team click and social bonding can be explained in terms of the tethering of physical and social cognitions via hierarchical generative architecture of the AIF.  In brief, it appears that the bonding effects of team click relate to processes whereby viscerality and social agency become associated with more elaborate and culturally-contingent cognitions characteristic of social bonding.  As with the link between joint action and team click, the link between team click and social bonding is driven by the overarching mandate of uncertainty minimisation.

As outlined above, team click is a phenomenon generated by bodies and brains in motion, which directs attention to interoceptive and lower order prediction errors during joint action.  The AIF proposes that lower level sensorimotor processes are tethered to higher order cognitions via an hierarchical generative architecture \citep{Ramstead2016}.  In this proposal, higher order cultural affordances couple with lower level sensorimotor processes in order to reduce overall uncertainty by explaining away lower order perceptions.  Pezzulo invokes fear-driven belief in the Bogeyman as an example of this phenomenon at work:

    \begin{quote}
      You quite literally recognise a bogeyman with your body, and with your fear in particular.  As a consequence, the bogeyman idea is a form of \textit{self-fulfilling prophecy}, because a terrified child can take his or her terror as evidence that the bogeyman exists (and is probably close), and the terror itself can increase due to the circular causality [of active inference] \citep[909]{Pezzulo2014}
    \end{quote}

Here, the bogey man functions as an affordance enlisted to ``explain away'' lower level sensorimotor experiences.  In the same sense that there is no material evidence for the bogeyman (or a universal moralising high god, for example), team click does not exist as a concrete object that an athlete can see or touch when off-line and off the field.  Instead, concepts such as tacit understanding, group flow, and team atmosphere are all examples of higher-order linguistically mediated concepts (cultural affordances) that enable reconciliation between lower and higher levels of generative models architecture.


\myparagraph{Emotional support and common goal derive from an attribution of individual viscerality to agency of others}
It is possible that perceived emotional support and common goal with teammates may arise from the reinforcement between
individually-felt viscerality promoted in joint action defined by high levels of uncertainty,  and the social category of others or team.
        - process of 2nd-order precision precision-weighting: reinforcing a visceral cognition
        Distributed agency

Theoretical evidence substantiates the proposal that team click is defined by the combination of viscerality and social agency.


According to the AIF, it appears that viscerality becomes associated with the agency of others through a process of 2nd-order precision precision-weighting: reinforcing a visceral cognition
Distributed agency: others act as the affordance to which you distribute the internal visceral feeling to explain way its persistence.

\section{Research hypotheses}


Based on research questions set out in Chapter 1, and the empirical and theoretical evidence reviewed in this chapter, I formulate the following hypotheses for a general account of team click in group exercise:

\myparagraph{Hypothesis 1: Core hypothesis}

The core hypothesis of this thesis tests the relationship between joint action, team click and social bonding.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Team click will mediate a relationship between perceptions of success in team performance and social bonding.  Specifically:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item More positive perceptions of success in team performance will generate higher levels of team click
      \item Higher levels of team click will lead to higher levels of social bonding
      \item More positive perceptions of success in team performance will generate higher levels of social bonding
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


In addition, I also formulate an hypothesis concerning preceding mechanism to team click:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Better-than-expected execution of joint action will mediate a relationship between prior levels of uncertainty and team click.  Specifically:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Higher levels of uncertainty in joint action lead to lower expectations of successful team performance.
    \item Higher levels of uncertainty will therefore lead to more positive perceptions of team performance when team performance is perceived to be more successful.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}






















                                              \end{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}

%These behavioural and neurophysiological data, taken together, indicate that musical training leads to the emergence of cross-modal action-perception coupling, where perception of the effects of musical actions (either the sounds produced or the visual presentation of the movement patterns) triggers proprioceptive predictions for the movements necessary to produce these effects. Interestingly, these effects have also been observed in trained non-experts \citep{Bangert2003,Lahav2007}.  Lahav and colleagues (2007), for example, trained non-musicians to play a piano piece by ear (without notation) over a period of five days and found that activation of the frontoparietal motor-related network (comprising Broca’s area, the premotor region, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior parietal region) increased most strongly for the trained pieces, versus untrained (but motorically known) and familiar but motorically unknown pieces.

%Neurophysiological evidence suggests a neural signature for action-perception coupling in the motor cortices.  Haueisen and Knosche \citep{Haueisen2001} conducted a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study (of piano players with and without experience) and showed that perception of piano pieces led to an increase of neural activity over the motor cortex hand area in piano players but not non-musicians.  Bangert and colleagues \textcite{Bangert2006} ran an fMRI study where professional pianists and non-musicians heard novel piano sequences that were synthesised online (and therefore could not be familiar).  Compared to non-musicians, professional pianists showed a broad network of motor areas responding to the piano sequences, including both primary motor and premotor (BA 4/6) regions.  Besides auditory- and visual-motor coupling, tactile, proprioceptive and haptic sensory feedback has been shown to induce coupling \citep{Schulz2003,Kuchenbuch2014}.

%In essence, action-perception coupling refers to the ostensive co-occurrence of a stimulus for action and its motor representation.  For example, the representation of a perceptual effect (say the sound of a middle-C on a piano) can trigger the movement necessary to produce the effect itself (motor instructions for playing the middle-C key on a piano).   Importantly, evidence suggests that sensory-motor coupling emerges primarily as a result of motor learning: having only visual \citep{Candidi2014} or auditory \citep{Lahav2007} experience with a given action is not sufficient to trigger these motor responses—--active motor learning is necessary.
