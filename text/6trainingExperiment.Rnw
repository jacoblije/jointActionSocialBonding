In this chapter I will present results of a field experiment  designed to further test the relationship between joint action, team click, and social bonding.  58 Professional Chinese rugby players (men = 30) participated in a between-subjects design involving two manipulations of a common rugby training drill known as ``invasion drill'' \citep{Passos2011}.  In the ``low uncertainty'' condition, athletes were primed with information to suggest that the training drill would be very easy to complete (2/10 difficulty rating).  In the ``high uncertainty'' condition, athletes were primed to expect the training drill to be relatively difficult (8/10 difficulty).
Pre and post survey measures were recorded, along with video footage of each experimental trial.  It was predicted that those athletes in the high-uncertainty condition would experience higher levels of team click and social bonding owing to higher than expected positive violation of expectations around group performance.
Athletes in the ``low uncertainty'' condition would on average experience less positive violations of expectations, and thus would feel less strongly the phenomenon of ``team click'' and flow-on feelings of social bonding.  Video footage was analysed for evidence of dynamic coupling between co-actors as well as defenders \citep{Schmidt2011,Richardson2012,Passos2012}, and these data were compared to psychological measures.  Results are yet to be fully analysed.
