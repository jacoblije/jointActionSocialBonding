\section{Abstract}


\section{First night in Beijing, August 2015}

Adrian, Kai, and I waited for Mr Shi to arrive in the upstairs area of the Korean BBQ restaurant in a quiet Peking willow lined street just inside Beijing's East 4th Ring Road.  Adrian, the host of the dinner, was an elder of Chinese rugby.  He was captain of the second graduating class of rugby players the Chinese Agricultural University (CAU), the home of China's first official rugby union program, established in 1990.  I first met Adrian two years earlier through my good friend Kai.  Kai was a more recent graduate of CAU (2007), a former Chinese National rugby team representative, and since graduation, a lawyer in Beijing.  Mr Shi, the guest of honour for whom the three of us were waiting, was a technical producer for Chinese Central Television's Sport Channel, CCTV5.

World Rugby, the international governing body of rugby, had recently given CCTV5 the broadcasting rights to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, to be held imminently in England during September and October 2015.  Mr Shi had been charged with the technical production of the 48-match Tournament, but was completely new to rugby, and so needed help making rugby accessible and understandable for a Chinese audience.\footnote{The Rugby World Cup is the third largest sporting event in world sport, behind the Summer Olympics and the Football World Cup. The broadcast of the 2015 World Cup was the first time international rugby was televised on Chinese national television.}  Mr Shi reached out through his network in Beijing and soon tracked down Adrian; Adrian, in turn, tracked down Kai.  Both were well connected to the Chinese rugby community and fluent in English, and so were well placed to assist Mr Shi in the tasks of translating relevant rugby materials and organising expert commentators for the broadcast.

My arrival in Beijing was timely for this project, and Kai was quick to recruit me to join them at dinner.  I was eager to catch up with old friends as well as begin my fieldwork. And so, despite my jet lag, I accepted the invitation and set off to the Korean BBQ restaurant on that first Saturday evening with my notebook and audio recorder (i.e., my mobile phone) in hand.

Adrian naturally held the floor while the three of us waited for Mr Shi to arrive.  He reminisced fondly about his time playing rugby at CAU, as well as his time after graduation playing with the Beijing Devils, a rugby club in Beijing whose members were predominantly expats.

\begin{quotation}
      Rugby was so much fun in those days, not like today (in the professional era of Chinese rugby).  Everyone was just scraping together the money to go on tour, we all payed our own way, sometimes you'd get a bit of help from someone or whatever. It was for the love of the game, not for any other reason.
\end{quotation}

When Mr Shi finally arrived, Adrian continued the nostalgic story telling mode, but naturally shifted his target audience from Kai and me to Mr Shi.  When Adrian began to describe in rich detail the experience of camaraderie between he and his Beijing Devils team mates when they participated in overseas rugby tour, he interrupted his own story with an explanatory aside directed at Mr Shi, accommodating for the fact that Mr Shi was relatively unacquainted with the sport: ``This sport of rugby union, it's actually very mysterious. If you haven't played it yourself you might not know this type of feeling,'' Adrian respectfully suggested to Mr Shi.  ``Because rugby, you know, you're all on the field together, there's body contact between...'' he paused to find the right phrasing,  ``...its a very `carnal' type of feeling. Everyone is very close.''  His attempts to enrich his communication by gesticulating had led him to have both of his hands clenched as fists in front of him like they were cradling a rugby ball, a lit cigarette smouldering between the index and middle finger of his right hand.  Adrian concluded by reiterating: ``Its very mysterious.'' Adrian shook his head as if baffled and finally released his clenched fists to dab the ash from his cigarette into the ashtray in front of him. After taking another drag from his cigarette he finally added: ``So it means this rugby circle here in China is very tight...'' (a short pause for another dab of his cigarette) ``...but it doesn't mean that this circle is not also not also completely chaotic!''\footnote{Circle (\textit{quanzi} 圈子) is a common way to refer to a social group or community of people}.  The wisdom of Adrians's final punchline was confirmed with a knowing chuckle from all of us, including Mr Shi. Adrian concluded silently, with a long, satisfying drag of his cigarette.

%英式橄榄球这个项目其实特别神秘，没玩过的话您可能不知道这种感觉，因为英式橄榄球么，大家在场上有身体接触，是一种``肉''的感觉，大家互相都特别亲，特别神秘。
%所以在橄榄球这个圈子特别亲, 但这不是说这个圈儿也不乱！

I was both captivated and somewhat shocked by Adrian's monologue. I was not expecting, so early into my fieldwork, to happen upon a declaration in which the link between visceral (i.e., carnal \textit{rou} 肉) sensations associated with on-field joint action and more abstract social processes of interpersonal emotional affiliation (\textit{qin}) and group cohesion of the rugby community (\textit{quanzi}) was so explicitly and spontaneously emphasised.  It was clear that, some fifteen years after he had finished playing, rugby's carnal dimension continued to capture Adrian emotionally---leading to clenched fists and a shaking head.  I was also intrigued that the source of this emotional capture was to him at once both very specific (derived from playing together with others on the field) and at the same time ultimately ``mysterious.'' The aim of this dissertation, which I was well aware of that night, was to explain group exercise in terms of its social, historical, physiological, and psychological components and dynamics.  In essence, the aim was to move from phenomenological mystery to scientific mechanism.

I did not fully realise it at the time, but Adrian's closing caveat concerning the messiness of the Chinese rugby circle also helped guide my observations during the ensuing months of fieldwork.  I came to experience first hand the complexity beneath Adrian's sarcasm.  In the case of the group of professional athletes of the Beijing men's rugby team, with whom I conducted extended ethnographic research, the experience of on-field joint action in rugby was used by athletes as a source for explaining social discord as much as it was cited as a source of cohesion, and social connection and affiliation appeared to co-exist at times with the ``chaos'' of interpersonal competition, bickering, and hierarchy.  In reality, the on-field demands of rugby were central to any rugby program in China, these demands were only one part of the larger social game that the athletes, coaches, and officials I observed were constantly playing.  And, while the on-field demands of rugby were relatively unfamiliar to Chinese athlete, off-field social interactions were structured by familiar institutionalised incentives and chronic cultural dispositions that have existed in China well before (and well beyond) the introduction of modern interactional team sports such as rugby union.

Nonetheless, as I peeled back these layers of context in the research setting, I found evidence that on-field experience of joint action in rugby was indeed highly relevant to processes of social affiliation and group membership.  In this dissertation I present ethnographic and experimental evidence that a relationship between joint action and social bonding is resilient to the chaos of rugby in China.

Needless to say, I left that first dinner eager to investigate the sources of Adrian's experience of mysterious carnality and social connection in rugby's joint action.  My next stop, on Monday morning, was the Temple of God of Agriculture Sports Institute, where I had organised to conduct ethnographic research with the Beijing Provincial rugby program.

\section{Scientific explanations of group exercise}
Competitive team sports, whirling Sufi dervishes, late-night electronic music raves, Maasi ceremonial dances, or the fitness cults of Cross-fit and Soul Cycle---endless examples can be plucked from across cultures and throughout time to exemplify the human compulsion to come together and move together.  How is it possible to explain the prevalence of physiologically exertive and socially coordinated movement in the human record?  In this dissertation I contribute to a scientific understanding of physiologically exertive and socially coordinated movement (hereafter simply ``group exercise'') by way of a focussed study of the social cognition of joint action among professional Chinese rugby players.

%ATQ: something about greater attention to mechanisms and dynamics of movement regulation in multi-agent human cognitive systems.
%TEXT BOX:{Definition of Group Exercise}

Because physical movement is a metabolically expensive endeavour for all biological organisms, it is justifiable, in an evolutionary sense, only if the benefits somehow outweigh the costs.  It is easy to imagine how physiologically exertive and coordinated group activities would have served important survival functions in our ancestral past, such as hunting, travel, communication, and defence \citep{Sands2010}.  In more recent domains of human history, however, the task of explaining the persistent recurrence of group exercise is  more complicated.  At least since the late Pleistocene era (approx. 500ka), and particularly since the Holocene transition (approx. 11ka) from hunter-gatherer to agricultural, and later industrial and post-industrial societies, group exercise can be identified in shared cultural practices as varied as religion, organised warfare, music, dance, play, and sport.  Unlike group hunting or defence, the fitness-relevant benefits of these activities are not always as immediate or obvious.

Instead, the prevalence of group exercise in a diverse array of cultural practices in the more recent human record must be understood with the full appreciation of humans' species-unique evolutionary trajectory, defined by increasingly complex cognitive and cultural capacities, including technical manipulation of extra-somatic materials and ecologies; advanced theory of mind; and information-rich, malleable, and scaleable communication systems \citep{Fuentes2016}.  A theory capable of satisfactorily explaining group exercise within these distinctive evolutionary parameters is yet to be fully formulated \citep{Cohen2017}.

In this dissertation I draw attention to the way in which humans coordinate and regulate movement as a plausible source of social bonding.  Group exercise contexts invariably involve multiple actors who coordinate behaviours in time and space, usually in pursuit of a shared goal.  I concentrate on the cognitive mechanisms and system dynamics that enable and constrain joint action in group exercise, and draw attention to the social and psychological effects that occur when joint action functions optimally---i.e., when joint action ``clicks.''
The interactive team sport of rugby union serves as a highly suitable case study for studying team click in joint action.  (Contrived environment of high uncertainty). The cultural setting in China adds an extra dimension to my theoretical and empirical contributions.

The core prediction of this dissertation is thus that the widely identifiable phenomenon of ``team click'' mediates a relationship between joint action and social bonding.  I present ethnographic and field-experimental evidence that tests and confirms this core prediction, and I evaluate these results in terms of their implications for understanding the proximate cognitive mechanisms, ecological system dynamics, and ultimate evolutionary processes relevant to the anthropology of group exercise.

In this introductory chapter, I introduce existing cognitive and evolutionary accounts of group exercise, under what can be called the social high theory of group exercise and social bonding. I point out key knowledge gaps in the social high theory, before proposing the research domain of social cognition of joint action as the most suitable candidate for the formulation of a novel theory of social bonding through joint action scenarios common in group exercise.  I preview this novel theory (which is outlined in detail in Chapter ~\ref{theoryContribution}), including the theoretical predictions of this study.  I conclude the introduction with an outline of the empirical contributions of this dissertation.


\subsubsection{The ``social high'' theory of group exercise and social bonding}

In this section I outline existing cognitive and evolutionary accounts of group exercise.  Existing research detailing the immediate physiological, cognitive, and social mechanisms associated with group exercise suggests that group exercise is responsible for generating a psychophysiological environment conducive to social affiliation and trust.  This evidence lends support to the hypothesis, long speculated by social scientists \citep[see, for example][]{Durkheim1965}, that cultural activities in which group exercise feature foster social cohesion.  It is not yet clear, however, precisely how or whether group exercise uniquely generates social cohesion, or in what ways particular mechanisms vary by activity and cultural context.

Recent research has made a ceremony of invoking one particular passage from Durkheim (1965, pg. 217) to capture the ``collective effervescence'' of exertive and coordinated group activity found in arenas as diverse as music making, dance, military drills, and sport:
``Once the individuals are gathered together,'' reads the passage, ``a sort of electricity is generated from their closeness and quickly launches them to an extraordinary height of exaltation'' \citep{McNeill1995,Konvalinka2011,Fischer2014,Mogan2017}.  This passage powerfully captures the role of collective activity in generating positive emotional states and joint arousal, and, as I will discuss below, lends itself neatly to the prevailing hypothesis of the social high theory: that the ``electricity'' of group exercise is attributable to neuropharmacologically mediated affective mechanisms associated with pain and reward\citep{Dunbar2008,Cohen2009,Fischer2014,Launay2016}.

\myparagraph{Proximate: group exercise generates a psychophysiological environment conducive to social affiliation and trust}

The proximate mechanisms commonly identified in the social high theory of group exercise and social bonding (hereafter simply the ``social high theory'') tend to relate to one of two dimensions of group exercise: 1) the level of physiological exertion and 2) the level of coordination of movement between co-actors.

\subparagraph{Physiological exertion}
The health and wellbeing benefits associated with regular exercise, including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, autonomic dysfunction, early mortality, neurogenesis, enhanced cognitive ability, and improved mood, are becoming increasingly well-known \citep{Blair1994,Nagamatsu2014}.  It is now understood that strenuous and prolonged physical exercise is modulated by the same neuropharmacological systems responsible for regulating pain, fatigue, and reward \citep{Boecker2008,Raichlen2013}.  Common to all goal-oriented (human) behaviours that impose risks or high energy costs are neurobiological reward mechanisms, which are thought to condition these fitness-enhancing activities \citep{Burgdorf2006}.  Neurobiological rewards in exercise are associated with both central effects (improved affect, sense of well-being, anxiety reduction, post-exercise calm) and peripheral effects (analgesia), and appear to be dependent for their activation on exercise type, intensity, and duration \citep{Dietrich2004}.  Exercise-specific activity of neurobiological reward systems offers a plausible explanation for commonly reported sensations of positive affect, anxiety reduction, and improved subjective well-being during and following exercise---extremes of which are popularly referred to as the ``runner's high'' \citep{(Dietrich2004,Boecker2008,Raichlen2012}.

A series of laboratory studies involving human and non-human subjects exercising on stationary exercise equipment (treadmills, watt bikes) show that sustained aerobic exercise at a moderate intensity ($\sim70-85\%$ of maximum heart rate)---but not low ($\sim45\%$) or high ($\sim90\%$) intensities---induces activity in the endocannabinoid (eCB) system \citep{Raichlen2013}, and similar results have been obtained in studies on the opioidergic system \citep{Boecker2008}.  Endocannabinoids appear to play an influential role in exercise-specific neurobiological reward, with studies showing activation eCB activation in moderately intense exercise and in cursorial mammals, such as humans and dogs \citep[but not non-cursorial mammals, e.g., ferrets;][]{Raichlen2012}.  In addition to direct peripheral (analgesic) and central (psychological well-being and alteration) effects, eCBs are also responsible for activating ``traditional'' neurotransmitters (opioids, dopamine, and serotonin) also responsible for rewarding and reinforcing behaviour \citep{Sparling2003}.  These findings lead Raichlen to propose eCBs as a key neurobiological substrate responsible for motivating habitual engagement in aerobic exercise, by generating ``appetitive'' and hedonic associations with exercise behaviour \citep{Raichlen2012}.  This neurobiological evidence maps on to more extensive literature concerning the psychological effects of exercise, which indicates a duration and intensity ``sweet spot'' for exercise and positive affect, whereby moderate intensity exercise for durations of $\sim45$ minutes appears most optimal \citep{Reed2006}.

It is possible that the function of exercise-induced positive affect extends to the realm of social bonding, particularly when achieved in group exercise contexts \citep{Cohen2009,Machin2011}.  Endocannabinoids and opioids have been implicated in mammalian social bonding \citep{Fattore2010,Keverne1989}, and in humans specifically, there is evidence that endorphins (a particular class of endogenous opioids) mediate social bonding \citep{Dunbar2012,Shultz2010}.

\subparagraph{Behavioural synchrony}
Meanwhile, experimental evidence, predominantly from social psychology, suggests that time-locked coordination of behaviour between two or more individuals in the stable attractor/equilibrium states of either in-phase or anti-phase synchrony is conducive to psychological processes of self-other merging, liking, trust, and psychological affiliation. Relative to non-synchronous group activities, behaviourally synchronous movement increases social bonding and pro-social behaviour---an evolutionarily important outcome of bonded relationships \citep{Reddish2013,Reddish2013a,Wiltermuth2009}.  Recent studies have also found that, compared to solo and non-synchronous group exercise, synchronous group exercise leads to significantly greater post-workout pain threshold \citep{Cohen2009,Sullivan2014,Sullivan2013a, Sullivan2013b}.

In a recent review of the behavioural synchrony literature in social psychology, Mogan and colleagues
identify three candidate mediators of the relationship between behavioural synchrony and social bonding: 1) lower cognitive affective mechanisms implicating neuropharmacological reward systems (e.g., opioidergic), 2) neurocognitive action perception networks responsible for the experience of self-other merging, and 3) and processes of group-centred cognition responsible for perception and reinforcement of cooperation.  Mogan and colleagues speculate based on current evidence that affective physiological mechanisms may be more relevant to joint action involving larger group sizes in which generalised feelings of euphoria and pro-sociality are common (e.g., group), whereas neurocognitive mechanisms linking joint action and social bonding may be more applicable to smaller group sizes in which individuals can share intentions through ostensive signals and implicit (emotional) cues \citep{Semin2008,Frith2010}.

Studies linking synchrony with social bonding and cooperation are supported by a literature than connects nonconscious mimicry with liking and affiliation\citep{VanBaaren2009}.  The experimental studies above predominantly refer to dyadic synchronisation of behaviour.   There is also experimental evidence to suggest that exertive and social or coordinated dimensions of group exercise interact to produce social effects.  Recent experimental evidence suggests that social features of the exercise environment (for example, perceived social support, level and quality of behavioural synchrony, etc.) modulate exercise-induced mechanisms of pain, and reward \citep{Cohen2009,Sullivan2014,Tarr2015,Davis2015,Weinstein2016}. This work is bolstered by existing literature on the social modulation of pain \citep{Eisenberger2012a} and links between pain and prosociality \citep{Bastian2014a}.

\myparagraph{$The social high = synchrony x exertion$}
The social high theory of group exercise and social bonding thus tells a story in which positive affect---associated with neuropharmacologically-mediated pain analgesia and reward—--is extended to the social group via synchrony-activated cognitive mechanisms of such as self-other merging and perception and reinforcement of in-group cooperation.

Davis and colleagues recently designed two experiments to test different components of this theory \citep{Davis2015}.  In the first study, the authors manipulated exercise intensity and synchrony in novice rowers, finding an effect of exercise intensity (but not synchrony) on social bonding, with participants in the moderate intensity exercise conditions (i.e., in the neurobiological ``sweet spot'') contributing more to a public goods game than those in the lower intensity exercise conditions.  In a further study, an elite, highly bonded team of rugby players participated in solo, synchronised, and unsynchronised warm-up sessions, followed immediately by a familiar high intensity anaerobic running task; participants' anaerobic performance significantly improved after the brief synchronous warm-up relative to a non-synchronous warm-up.  These findings provide preliminary evidence for the role of rigorous, coordinated movement in processes of social bonding and cooperation.  These mechanisms of group exercise may crucially enable the electric ``collective effervescence'' necessary for social bonding and physiological endurance.

\myparagraph{Group exercise is ``grooming at a distance''}
It is possible to infer from this evidence that an adaptive value of group exercise pertains to the way in which it fosters social cohesion.  In so far as tightly bonded and well coordinated groups face better survival odds than those which are less so, bonding activities that foster social cohesion and trust can be considered collectively advantageous and adaptive \citep{Dunbar2010}.  It is plausible that group exercise has been subject to processes of cultural group selection, whereby the shared cultural activities in which group exercise commonly feature (music, dance, ritual, sport) have proliferated and fixated in human populations, owing to the assemblage of adaptive benefits which they bestow to individuals and groups \citep{Dunbar2010,Whitehouse2004,Atkinson2011a}.

The ultimate evolutionary explanation for group exercise has its roots in studies of social grooming in non-human primates. Dunbar and colleagues propose a neuropharmacologically mediated affective mechanism linking dyadic grooming practices with group-size maintenance \citep{Machin2011}.  The capacity for social cohesion is thought to have arisen in primates as an adaptive response to the pressures of group living.  Aggregating in groups serves to reduce threat from predation.  At the same time, it can be individually costly due to stress arising from interactions at close proximity and conflict over resources among genetically unrelated individuals.  These pressures are hypothesised to have led to selection for social bonding (e.g., via dyadic grooming).  Resulting coalitional alliances among close partners allow for the maintenance of the group by buffering the stresses of group living.  Primate social grooming, for example, is associated with the release of endorphins, presumably leading to sustained rewarding and relaxing effects.  While other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, oxytocin, or vasopressin may also be important in facilitating social interaction, endorphins are argued to reinforce individuals (who are not related or mating) to interact with each other long enough to build ``cognitive relationships of trust and obligation'' \citep[1839]{Dunbar2012}.  It is thought that, as the homo genus evolved more complex collaborative capacities for survival in interdependent group contexts, grooming-like behaviours sustained social bonding in larger groups where dyadic grooming would cumulatively take too much time \citep{Dunbar2012}.

Experimental studies suggest that neurophysiological mechanisms activated by activities that involve physical exertion and coordinated movement, such as group laughter, dance and music-making, exercise, and group ritual can bring groups closer together, mediated by the psychological effects of endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid release \citep{Cohen2009,Fischer2014a,Fischer2014,Sullivan2014,Tarr2016,Tarr2015}. Group exercise can in this sense be understood as a form of ``grooming at a distance.''

\subsubsection{Knowledge gaps in evolutionary approaches to group exercise}
The social high theory of exercise and social bonding offers an explanation for the types, intensities, and durations of exercise that 1) adhere to the currently prescribed ``sweet spot'' for exercise-induced neuropharmacological reward and positive affect, and 2) contain immediate contextual or behavioural cues of social support (e.g., synchrony).  While explanatory and testable, the social high theory of group exercise and social bonding remains rudimentary in its development.

As Adrian attempted to articulate to Mr Shi that first night in Beijing, there is an unmistakably ``visceral'' dimension to the experience of group exercise that is yet to be fully comprehended by current scientific theory.  One problem with Durkheim's oft-cited quote about the ``electricity'' of rigorous group activity (mentioned about), is that it has nothing to say about the subjective experience of group exercise on the part of its participants.

A cursory survey of the spectrum of group exercise contexts identifiable in human sociality today reveals that many group exercise deviate markedly from the narrow profile of moderate intensity physiological exertion, exact time- and space-locked synchrony, and a feel good social high.  In this section, I outline some of the noticeable knowledge gaps in the social high theory, offer some explanation for the sources for these gaps, and draw upon adjacent literature from the cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of ritual in order to suggest a way forward for developing a cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of group exercise.

%There is no concern for the cognitive processes---of individual and joint movement regulation---that enable the group activity to materialise; and no mention of whether or not the group activity was performed as participants expected, worse than expected, or better than expected.  These processes and others like them, far from being mysterious, pertain to specific scientific literatures in psychology and cognitive science, and could be centrally important to the relationship between group exercise and social cohesion.

\myparagraph{Extreme cost}
While many group exercise contexts meet the intensity and duration duration for physiological exertion, it is also clear that many group exercise contexts require extreme (as opposed to moderate) levels of physiological exertion.  Furthermore, many group exercise contexts appear, on the surface at least, to be more fundamentally defined by pain, coercion, discipline, and even violence, instead of hedonic enjoyment. Sports that come to mind here include high-stakes professional competitive sporting contexts (international-level sports, rowing or ultra-marathon running, for example), extreme adventure sports (big wave surfing, free-diving), or high-intensity contact (Rugby Union, NFL, Ice Hockey) or combat  sports (MMA, boxing, wrestling).  Although it is expected that extremely physiologically costly exercise contexts will involve activation of neurobiological reward mechanisms outlined above, some may on average exceed (or alternatively never reach) the intensity and duration sweet-spot for optimal activation of neurobiological reward \citep{Raichlen2013} or positive affect \citep{Ekkekakis2011,Reed2006}.

\myparagraph{Profound meaning}
It is also apparent that exercise offers to its participants and observers an opportunity for profound meaning.  Many people do not engage in exercise \textit{just} for health or enjoyment; rather, in some contexts sport forms part of a life of purpose and self-discovery \citep[see, for example][]{Jackson1995,Jones2004,White2011}.  Modern sport has always been much more than ``just a game,'' and instead offers an arena in which virtues and vices are learned, and the ``morality plays''—--of community, nation, or globe—--thus performed \citep{Elias1986,McNamee2008}.  Athletes at the elite apex of their sports commonly report the autotelic experience of ``flow''--—described as full immersion in the ``here and now,'' effortlessness, or optimal experience \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992,Dietrich2004}.  Whereas the social high theory predicts motivation for exercise based on ``hedonic'' enjoyment, anecdotal and ethnographic perspectives (discussed below) emphasise instead the ethical and moral dimensions of athletes’ experiences, and contextualise these experiences within political processes relating to the construction of the self, community, and nation-state \citep{Alter1993,Brownell1995, Downey2005b,Wacquant2004}.  In many instances, it may be that the primary psychological motivation for exercise is not immediate, reward-induced hedonic wellbeing, but instead \textit{eudaimonic} wellbeing, or the psychological awareness of a process through which life becomes ``well-lived'' \citep{Fave2009,Huta2013}.

\myparagraph{Fine-grained quality of joint action}
The quality of coordination in joint action is heavily scrutinised in technically demanding group exercise contexts such as competitive interactional team sports or, music-making and dance.  For their success, these activities depend upon highly complex coordination of behaviours between individuals, in which the movements of one individual must align precisely in time and space with the movements of another.  For highly skilled practitioners who develop a fine-grained sensitivity concerning the perceived outcome of joint action, often the ecstasy of group activity is contingent not just on participation, but on the extent to which joint action with co-participants ``clicks.''

The psychological literature of optimal human experience (also known as ``flow'' \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992}) offers extensive documentation of the positive psychological and social effects of technically complex movement in individual and, to a lesser extent, joint action. To date, however, very little research has dealt directly with the relationship between perceptions of \textit{quality} joint action and processes of social bonding and group formation \citep[but see][]{Marsh2009}.  In this dissertation I develop the social high theory of group exercise and social bonding by looking beyond the generalised neuropharmacologically-mediated electricity of ``collective effervescence,'' to the social cognition of human movement.

The sources of positive affect in group exercise context may be dependent on more than just whether or not an adherent achieves a broad sweet spot of physiological exertion, or rudimentary behavioural synchrony. Clear variation in them types, intensities, and durations of group exercise, and the complexity of subjective experience of and motivation for group exercise presents an opportunity for further research into explanatory cognitive, evolutionary, and social mechanisms.


\myparagraph{Existing anthropology of group exercise}
A broader spectrum of motivations and experiences in group exercise are reflected in the social and cultural anthropological accounts, with various monograph-length studies  focusing less on the affective or sensorial experience of the athlete, and more on the personal and cultural commitments and meanings negotiated at the site of the athlete’s body in various cultural contexts.

Social anthropologists and sociologists have for some time emphasised the social function of exercise and sport in diverse cultural contexts, and various attempts have been made to analyse the phenomenological experience of exercise in terms of its sociological and psychological meaning \citep{Bourdieu1978}.  Social anthropologist Joseph Alter (1993), for example, argues that, for wrestlers in north India, the body functions as a nexus through which the symbolic and material structures of the state, family, and the individual coalesce.  In a similar vein, Susan Brownell (1995), in a seminal ethnography of sport in China, argues that sport functions as a crucial national symbolic practice for the Chinese nation-state in a project of ``rejoining the world,'' and that the ``micro-techniques'' (c.f. Foucault, 1975) of this project entail significant cost (and rich meaning) to the individual athlete.   Similarly, French sociologist Loic Wacquant (2004), in an ethnography of boxers in Chicago’s south side, describes a ``social logic'' of physical activity, claiming that the daily dedication and high technique that training demands; the regimented diet; the control, mutual respect, and tacit understandings necessary for actual fist-to-fist competition serve to create for the boxer ``an island of order and virtue'' (2004, p. 17).  In a recent extension of this line of ethnographic work, researchers have attempted to theorise the cognitive implications for different social-cultural frames of belief and understanding surrounding skill-acquisition and performance in sport and exercise \citep{Downey2005bDowney2007,Marchand2010}.

These samples of the social anthropology of sport represent an attempt to interpret an ethnographically observed connection between adherence to group exercise and the social and psychological meaning that appears to be tethered to this adherence.  While compelling and rich in ethnographic detail, these accounts do not explicitly engage in the project that is the central focus of this dissertation—--i.e., an \textit{explanatory} account of group exercise in human sociality.


\myparagraph{Bifurcation in the science of sport and exercise}
Noticeable gaps in cognitive and evolutionary accounts of group exercise can be in part explained by the specific history of the study of sport.  Social scientists of the past few centuries have occasionally included sport and group exercise as pseudo ritual-like activities responsible for producing social cohesion \citep{Durkheim1965,Mauss1935,Turner1977}.  However, core biological, cognitive, and evolutionary questions surrounding sport and exercise remain largely unexplored by the behavioural sciences, including anthropology \citep{Blanchard1995,Downey2005a}.

While efforts to identify proximate cognitive and psychological mechanisms underlying the social function of religion and ritual began soon after the modern evolutionary synthesis \citep{Huxley1942} and cognitive revolution \citep[e.g.,][]{Turner1986,1987}—---the continuation of which has matured as a program of research in evolutionary anthropology and the cognitive science of religion \citep{Barrett2002,Lawson1993,Sperber1996,Whitehouse2004}---an equivalent program of research is yet to emerge around sport and exercise \citep{Blanchard1995,Downey2005a}.  Sport and exercise has meanwhile been investigated within modes of scientific analysis concerned instrumentally with either the health benefits of exercise \citep{Fiuza-Luces2013,Morris1994}, or athletic performance \citep{Beedie2015a}, all the while neglecting to consider the cognitive or evolutionary role of exercise in human psychology or sociality \citep{Balish2013,Coulter2015}. A strict instrumental focus on athletic adherence and performance in sports psychology has restricted the psychology of exercise to an analysis of an ``athletic personality'' and the diverse motivations of the ``whole person,'' including the moral, ethical components of exercise, have been neglected \citep{Coulter2015,Laborde2014}.  As such, the cognitive and evolutionary dimensions of group exercise have escaped rigorous empirical analysis.

In sum, a review of existing literature in the anthropology of group exercise exposes a bifurcation of knowledge along two branches---one in which focus on causal physiological, cognitive, and social mechanisms of exercise is driven by priorities of athletic performance and public health outcomes, and another in which the study of group exercise forms part of a broader discipline in which social, ethical, and moral hermeneutics is more dominant than cognitive and evolutionary theory.  This bifurcation has created a scenario in which the evidence available for the cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of group exercise has been been derived either very close to the treadmill---from laboratory paradigms in which components and effects of group exercise (e.g., exact behavioural synchrony and direct or assay measures of neuropharmacological activity) are hyper-essentialised for experimental manipulation and operationalisation---or, alternatively, very far from the treadmill---by ethnographic researchers whose priorities do not include identifying or testing causal processes.  The existing social high theory of group exercise and social bonding suffers somewhat from this bifurcation in anthropology, and would benefit from attempts to address the space between the treadmill and the social field.  In this dissertation, I actively address the knowledge gaps in the social high theory of group exercise and social bonding, using an inclusive human science integrating psychology, cognitive and neuroscience, and anthropology \citep{Whitehouse2012,Downey2014}.



\subsubsection{Team Click and the social cognition of joint action}

In this section I introduce the phenomenon of team click.

One of the big mysteries of competitive team sport, particularly at the elite level, is the elusiveness of peak team performance.  While each individual athlete may exhibit expert level competence in sport specific skills, the much sought after aggregation of these components, i.e. a team that consistently performs ``in the zone,'' and ``firing on all cylinders,'' in reality often proves frustratingly difficult to achieve and sustain.  As King and De Rond \textcite[568]{King2011} note in their ethnography of the 2008 Cambridge University rowing crew who participated (and who were eventually victorious) in the famous annual Boat Race against Oxford University, the search for collective rhythm is a universal in human social interaction, but  the physiological and psychological complexity of finding that rhythm ``...is extremely difficult to attain; collective performance is a possibility not a certainty.''   The moment in which everything ``clicks'' into place in team sport can, for various reasons, disappear as abruptly as it arrives, if indeed it arrives at all.

But, when team click is somehow cultivated, and even sustained, it is celebrated as the ultimate, albeit often inexplicable magic of sporting feats. Consider Leicester City Football Club's unbelievable outhouse-to-penthouse title run in the 2015 English Premier League, the recent dominance of the Golden State Warriors in the American National Basketball League, or the astonishingly consistent performance of the New Zealand men's national rugby union team (the ``All Blacks'').  The All Blacks are arguably the most successful sporting team ever, with a winning percentage of 77\% in the last 150 years (and 88\% in the last 6 years) \citep{SOURCE}.  All of these successful teams carry with them a powerful ``aura'' associated with their capacity to effectively coordinate their behaviours on the field over extended time scales: individual games, seasons, and, in the case of the All Blacks, entire generations.  The aura associated with such rare instances of collective performance can seduce fascination and elaborate exegesis.  In this thesis I commit to the more banal task of naturalising the phenomenon of team click, by locating it within a novel theory of social bonding through joint action.

I use the term team click to describe the phenomenology of peak performance within a team of athletes engaged in joint action.  For athletes, coaches, and spectators alike, team click can be a hugely powerful sensation. As theologian Michael Novak explains, ``[f]or those who have participated on a team that has known the click of communality, the experience is unforgettable, like that of having attained, for a while at least, a higher level of existence'' \citep[11]{White2011}. It has been extensively documented in the psychological literature of flow and optimal human performance in sport that athletes engaged in team coordination often report total absorption in and complete focus on the task at hand, a transformation of the experience of time (either speeding up or slowing down), and a blurring or transcendence of individual agency, or a ``loss of self''   \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992,Jackson1995,Jackson1999,McNeill1995}.  Research suggests that flow often occurs in scenarios in which there are clear goals inherent in the activity, as well as unambiguous feedback concerning extent to which goals are either being achieved or not.  In addition, scenarios most conducive to the experience of flow are those in which the technical requirements are challenging but achievable if practitioners are able to extend slightly beyond their normal capabilities\citep{Fong2015}.
The coalescence of these factors is intrinsically rewarding and autotelic\citep{Csikszentmihalyi1975}, activating both ``hedonic'' and ``eudaimonic'' dimensions of subjective well-being \citep{Huta2010,Fave2009}.

Importantly, team click appears to have important flow-on consequences relevant to social bonding and affiliation. Tightly synchronised activity in particular, found in team sports such as rowing, can help dissolve the boundaries between individual and social agency: ``In rowing...it feels like you have at your command the power of everybody else in the boat. You are exponentially magnified. What was a strain before becomes easier. It is absolutely the ultimate team sport'' \citep{Brown2016}.
The blurring of agency between self and team may be responsible for facilitating affiliation and trust between teammates in competitive athletic environments such as professional rugby, which often involves high physiological stress and uncertainty: ``...you always wanted a guy who would go into the trenches with you and he always played consistently well...he could really play and was just one of the good lads that you enjoyed his company'' \citep{Fox-Sports2017}. In this sense, the experience of team click may act as a social diagnostic tool, a powerful signal of commitment to joint action and willingness to cooperate \citep{Reddish2013a}.

The experience of flow has by now been extensively studied by psychologists and neuroscientists, from which a series of neuropharmacological \citep{Boecker2008}, neurocognitive \citep{Dietrich2006,Dietrich2011,Labelle2013}, and psychological \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992} theories for its emergence have been tabled.  The vast majority of flow research has focussed on the experience of the individual---the athlete, musician, or performer.  Some attempts have been made to extended an analysis of flow and its antecedents to the level of the group and dynamics of interpersonal coordination---a phenomenon termed ``group flow'' \citep{Sawyer2006}---but these attempts lack coherence and development.

Team click shares many similarities with the psychological states associated with ``flow'' and peak performance \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992}, but is distinct in that it specifically delineates perceptions of joint action from individual action, and therefore implicates physiological, cognitive, and social mechanisms unique to joint action \citep{Pesquita2017}, as well as nonlinear systems dynamics associated with participating in a socially-coordinated, multi-agent system of physical movement \citep{Kelso2009}.  Team click is anecdotally present in a wide range of joint action contexts, and is often associated in these contexts with psychological processes of positive affect and wellbeing, as well as personal agency, social affiliation, and group membership \citep{Jackson1995,Marsh2009,Wheatley2012,Slingerland2014}.

While the contextual antecedents\citep{Fong2015}, neuropharmacological \citep{Boecker2008} and neurocognitive mechanisms \citep{Dietrich2004,Dietrich2011,Cheron2016}, and psychological consequences \citep{Wheatley2012} of flow and related states have been well researched, the way in which these processes are modulated by the action of others and the ecological dynamics of the task-specific environment are less well understood. Further still, very few researchers have attempted to situate flow and related group-level psychological phenomena within a broader evolutionary framework \citep[but, for a general theoretical proposal, see][]{Slingerland2014}).  Reasons for these knowledge gaps within cognitive and evolutionary approaches to flow and joint action include 1) the way in which assumptions of established neo-Darwinian theory serve to occlude dynamical properties of biological phenomena \citep{Laland2011}, including the interactive informational processes distributed beyond and between individuals and 2) the methodological difficulty in quantifying non-linear dynamics of human movement \citep{Kelso2009}.

\subsubsection{The social cognition of joint action}

In this section I review evidence from the social cognition of joint action, which can be used to formulate a novel theory of social bonding through joint action.

Representation,

Recent advances in neuroimaging technologies \citep{Frith2007}, emerging neurocomputational theories of brain function \citep{Friston2010,Frith2010,Clark2013}, and constructive attempts to extend the theoretical paradigm of human social cognition to account for inter-individual processes of interaction and coordination \citep{Sebanz2006,Dale2014}, now provide an opportunity to address significant knowledge gaps within the cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of group exercise.  Owing to innovative research within this domain, it is now more clearly understood that basal human capacities for physical movement regulation and coordination set the foundation for social cognitive systems whose resources are distributed between brains, bodies, and physical features of task-specific environments \citep{Hutchins2000,Kirsh2006,Semin2008,Semin2012,Coey2012}.


Furthermore, it has been shown that the quality of coordinated movement within these cognitive systems has implications for psychophysiological health and subjective well-being \citep{Wheatley2012}, and is relevant to the effective function of more complex goal oriented social activities, including the large-scale reproduction and transmission of shared cultural practices \citep{Dunbar2012,Roepstorff2010,Claidiere2014,Launay2016}. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that the ``visceral'' dimension of group exercise, traditionally occluded by theoretical convention and methodological challenges, can now be accessed by interrogating the ways in which cognitive mechanisms and system dynamics of joint action are responsible for processes of social cohesion.

A key facet of the paradigm shift in social cognition outlined above is the overhaul of traditional individual-centred computational models of information processing (originally inspired by the mechanics of the electronic computer), which tend to render movement as the final product of a linear sequence of sensory perception, amodal mental representation, and action selection \citep{Lewis2005}.  By contrast, the prevailing neurocomputational paradigm of ``predictive processing,'' also known as ``predictive coding,'' \citep[see][]{Frith2007,Kilner2009,Clark2013} offers a model of brain function in which perception, representation, emotion, and action are functionally and temporally integrated in the service of informational processes.  Perception, cognition, and action work closely together to minimise sensory prediction errors by selectively sampling, and actively sculpting, the stimulus array. It has been suggested that the cognitive principle of error minimisation should be understood as a consequence of an overarching mandate of an organic system to minimise the informational degrees of freedom or ``free energy'' in that system's exchanges with the environment \citep{Friston2010}.


PJAM:


\myparagraph{Functional interpersonal synergies}
The establishment and perpetuation of joint action itself resembles a cognitive system whose resources are distributed throughout other actors.  For a brain in the business of prediction error and free energy minimisation, interpersonal interactions with other agents present a computational challenge due to the moving parts.  The large number of independently controllable degrees of freedom of multiple agents places computational burden to the central nervous system, dubbed by Bernstein \textcite{Bernstein1967} as the ``degrees-of-freedom problem'' \citep[see also][]{Turvey1982,Turvey1990}.  From a system dynamics perspective, a solution to this problem is to work in such a way that the degrees of freedom residing in different actors and environmental features are coupled to form low-dimensional, reciprocally compensating synergies, known as ``functional interpersonal synergies'' \citep{Riley2011}.

Research into the coordination dynamics of joint action has shown evidence of dynamic coupling (functional synergy) in joint action tasks, such as dancing, martial arts, moving objects like furniture.  In studies involving skilled versus non-skilled practitioners in dyadic interactions, it has been shown that more skilled practitioners create stronger dynamical coupling through flexibly modulating their actions with others \citep{Schmidt2011,Caron2017}. Experimental evidence has shown that functional interpersonal synergies facilitate performance of social cognitive or linguistic tasks, such as gaze coordination and turn taking in conversation \citep{Miles2010,Richardson2005,Shockley2009}.  Conversely, being psychologically distanced from another individual can inhibit the emergence of interpersonal synergies \citep{Miles2010}.  The ways in which functional interpersonal synergies facilitate adaptive information transfer between individuals and within groups suggests that psychological mechanisms and cultural practices responsible for generating these synergies could have been subject to cultural evolutionary forces of selection and attraction \citep{Claidiere2014,Mesoudi2016a}.


The link between interpersonal coordination and social bonding has been addressed in the behavioural mimicry and synchrony literatures \citep[e.g.,][]{Wheatley2012,Launay2016,Mogan2017}, but there is less substantive evidence in relation to dynamic interpersonal coordination in natural joint action settings such as those found in group exercise contexts \citep{Marsh2009,Miles2009,Lumsden2012}.

More recently, however, analysis of dynamic coupling of co-actors in joint action scenarios reveals that synchronised movement implicates an array of implicit and pre-perceptual cognitive processes of alignment and prediction error minimisation \citep{Schmidt2011}, which, in addition to more explicit forms of communication, could be central to the generation of feelings of self-other merging, self-other distinction, and perceived reliability and trust associated with social bonding \citep{Marsh2009}.


\subsection{Affect}
Observation and anecdote in sport suggests that part of the exhilarating nature of team click is the way in which the experience of joint action induces positively valenced surprise, or in other words, positively violates athletes' prior expectations for joint action \citep{Jackson1999}.

unsuccessful joint action appears to induce an inverse, negatively valenced violation of expectation, linked to emotional states of displeasure \citep{Ekkekakis2003}.

Surprisal in this inferential cognitive process is simply due to a prediction error that is subsequently fed-back to the cognitive system for the purposes of tuning and enhancing models of future action and inference\citep{Clark2013}.

Processes of prediction error management and minimisation are underwritten by neurobiological systems of reward, particularly the dopaminergic system \citep{Schultz2013} and the opioidergic system to which, there is some evidence to suggest, the dopaminergic system may be yoked \citep{Pecina2013,Laurent2014}.

It has been hypothesised that affective responses from to expectation violation perform an evolutionary function as signals for adaptive organismic regulation, which includes the updating of shared task representations and motivations for future behaviour\citep{Cosmides2000,Barrett2017}.







While many details of the link between expectation violation and global emotional states experienced by individuals and collectives remain poorly understood, evidence suggests that surprise is a basal emotion that can carry both positive or negative valences \citep{Ortony1990}. In the case of joint action in particular, it can be predicted that unfolding joint action will either confirm or violate an individual's prior expectations, which are informed by both explicit and implicit informational inputs.  Expectation violation could be \textit{positive}, in the case that unfolding joint action is of higher quality than expected.  Expectation violation could also be \textit{negative}, owing to the perception that the unfolding joint action was of lower quality than expected.  It is also possible to predict that this spectrum of prediction error management contributes in a meaningful way to equivalent spectrum of emotional states \citep{Pessoa2014}; as-expected or better-than-expected coordination could, for example, contribute to a positively valenced emotional response, in the form of euphoric arousal.  Negative violation of expectations could lead to a negatively valenced dissonant emotional response.

\subsection{Study Predictions}


    The overarching prediction of this thesis is that the psychological phenomenon of team click mediates a relationship between joint action and social bonding.

    Within this main hypothesis, I also formulate the following sub-hypotheses:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Athletes who perceive greater success in joint action will experience higher levels of felt ``team click.'' I predict that relevant perceptions of joint action success will relate to athlete perceptions of:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item a combination of specific technical components; or
          \item an overall perception of team performance relative to prior expectations; or
          \item an interaction between these two dimensions of team performance.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Athletes who experience higher levels of team click will report higher levels of social bonding.
      \item More positive perceptions of joint action success will predict higher levels of social bonding, driven by more positive:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item perceptions of components of team performance;; or
        \item violation of team performance expectations; or
        \item an interaction between these two predictors.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Outline}

These predictions set the foundation for a particular study focussed on the relationship between joint action and social bonding in the case of professional Chinese rugby players. The specific ethnographic context (sport in China) demands a careful consideration of the predictions formulated above.  Culturally specific processes of self-construal and social group formation challenge some of the assumptions built in to the literatures mentioned above.  However, I argue that the predictions outlined above are robust to these cultural specificities, due to the fact that they are grounded in an agent neutral distributed social cognition framework. Indeed, despite distinct cultural variation processes of team membership, ethnographic analysis reveals that the experience of team click is strongly identifiable.

In order to test these predictions, I conduct a series of three interrelated studies.  The first study consists of extended ethnographic research with one Chinese professional rugby team, the Beijing Provincial men's rugby team (see Chapters ~\ref{4partAIntroMethod}\nobreakdash~\ref{6ethnographicResults}). From this ethnographic starting point, I then broadened the scope of analysis to include all available Chinese professional provincial rugby players. Participants for the second study ($n = 174, men = 93$) were athletes in a Chinese national tournament, in which fifteen different teams from nine different provinces competed over two days for the 2016 Championship (Chapter ~\ref{5ethnographicField}).  The tournament offered the opportunity to investigate hypotheses concerning the relationship between joint action, team click, and social bonding \textit{in situ}, in a real-world instance of high intensity, high stakes joint action.  Subsequently, in order to more definitively assesses the causal mechanisms identified in the predictions of this dissertation, I conducted a controlled field experiment ($n = 58, male = 29$). In a between-subjects design, I manipulated the level of predicted difficulty prior to athletes participating in ostensibly different (but in fact identical) training drills.
