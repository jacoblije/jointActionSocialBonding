\section{abstract}


The attributes of the overall sample of athletes are displayed in Table  The average training age of athletes was 4.22 years (SD = 2.11), with athletes having spent on average 5.64 years in the team. 36.21\% of the sample were full-time employees of their provincial team, and the remaining athletes were either employed on a full-time (but fixed term) contract
(13.79\%)), a ``student contract'' (27.59\%), a short term training contract (13.79\%))), or on a short-term trial basis ((3.45\%))).

Items relating to training group team click (tacit understanding, general atmosphere, click pictorial, and ability extended by the group) were subjected to EFA.  Correlations between the remaining were very high (all $r's > 0.29$), which suggested that one factor was appropriate (see Table ~\ref{tab:groupClickCorrTable}). The KMO index and Bartlett's test both suggested high sampling adequacy, ($KMO =  0.72, \chi^2(6, N = 116) = 127.86, p < .001$). One factor, labelled ``Group Click'' was imposed on the data, which explained 47.7\% of the overall variance ($SS Loading = 2$). $Guttmans \lambda = 0.73$ and $Cronbachs \alpha = 0.77$ indicated that the data reduction was appropriate and reliable.
