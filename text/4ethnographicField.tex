ABSTRACT:
Fieldwork in Beijing

















Qingdao:
Kai's hometown was Qingdao, and so we travelled down together on the high speed train after Kai finished work on the Friday evening in time to watch the Asia Sevens Tournament on the Saturday.  The Asia Sevens is an annual series of three regional rugby sevens tournaments featuring men's and women's national sevens teams.  The men's series has been held regularly since 2009, and the women's series was established in 2013. The series usually consists of two three annual Tournaments, alternating between various locations including Hong Kong, South Korea, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Malaysia, India, Singapore, and Thailand.  In 2015, The Asia Sevens Series Tournaments were held in Colombo, Bangkok, and Qingdao. Would be played on the Saturday and Sunday, and then the National Tournament would follow immediately after on the Monday and Tuesday.



Olympic Qualification:

When I arrived at the stadium in time for the beginning of the Asia Sevens Series, I met a number of coaches and athletes in the stands who I knew from my time in Beijing in 2008 and then coaching in 2013. I sensed from my various interactions that there was an air of nervousness around the Tournament, particularly on behalf of the Chinese women's team.   The Qingdao tournament was the final tournament before the Olympic Qualification Tournaments, to be held in Hong Kong and Tokyo in November 2015.  The top ranked team from those two legs would qualify for the Rio Olympics in 2016.  The Chinese men's team were not in serious contention for Olympic qualification, given the clear superiority of the more established men's rugby programs like Japan and Hong Kong. The Chinese Sports Commission did, however, expect the Chinese women's team to qualify for the Olympics.

Since the Chinese women's team was first established in 2002, China had made great strides in women's rugby, in both Asia and globally.  Not including occasional losses to closest rivals Kazakstan, between 2002 and 2012 the Chinese women's sevens team was the dominant women's team in Asia, easily outcompeting Japan and Hong Kong, and at times was competitive against the world's best including New Zealand and Australia.  The main reason for China's dominance in the women's game during this period was that other traditional rugby nations, despite having developed professional infrastructure for the men's game, lacked almost entirely an equivalent infrastructure for the women's game. China`s state sponsored sport system, on the other hand, was relatively agnostic towards gender in sport. According to the incentive structures of the Chinese sports system a gold medal is a gold medal, regardless of the gender of the recipient. (This is not to say that there are not distinct gender inequalities in relation to sport in China).
Indeed, beginning with the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team's gold medal victory at the LA Olympics in 1982, China has enjoyed a comparative advantage in women's sport due to the fact that the Chinese sport system was comparatively more supportive of women's sport.

Alarmingly for the Chinese women's rugby team's hopes of Olympic qualification, by 2014 it had become obvious that other more traditional rugby playing nations in Asia, namely Japan and Hong Kong, had begun to make up serious ground on China and Kazakstan in the women's game.  This naturally prompted nervousness among the GAS and CRFA.  In mid 2015 it was decided by the GAS and CRFA that they would enlist the services of a foreign coach.  According to sources close to CRFA, apparently the original plan was for the appointed foreign coach, BG, to act as a consultant for LXH and his existing group of coaches.  By the time I arrived in Qingdao in early September, however, the initial arrangement had since transformed into a situation in which BG was given 100\% control over the program as head coach, and LXH was more or less sidelined as coach.

The complication was that before being dethroned, LXH preferred to use his own athletes.  Most of the starting team at the LDN7s in June 2015 were indeed Shandong athletes, many of the women who had won gold at the National Games in 2013.  When BG took over the reigns as head coach, as directed by the GAS and CRFA, he set about reorganising the starting team and also scouting for new talent outside the squad, which was predominantly made up of Shandong athletes.

When I arrived in Qingdao it appeared that tensions between the old and new guard were at their peak.  LXH and many of his favoured athletes had been relegated to the bench, and some had been completely removed from the squad altogether.  There were 6 weeks to go before the all important first Olympic qualification tournament in Hong Kong.  I sat and watched the first few games of the women's Tournament, and I was indeed surprised to see that the Chinese women's side was missing some of its usual stalwarts, and indeed appeared in my eyes to lack the flow and familiarity that I had come to expect in LXH's clan.  In the stands I came across a group of Shandong women, one of which, QGG I knew quite well from when she toured to Australia with the Shandong team when I was still with the Australian rugby sevens team in early 2013.  I asked QGG why she wasn't playing for China, and it turned out that she was injured, and so wasn't eligible for selection.  But a few of the other women around her, who were all wearing Chinese national team uniforms, were all part of LXH's clan who had been effectively stood down by BG. ``How do you think they're playing?'' She asked me, after we had exchanged pleasantries. ``Not great'' I commented, hesitating, not knowing how much I should prime her, but also feeling obliged to be honest: ``it feels like they’re not coordinating together very well at the moment.  What do you think?'' （一般吧。感觉她们的配合不太好,目前。你觉得呢？） I asked.  ``They’re out there playing as individuals, not playing as a team! They can't get it together; there's no shared goal.'' `(她们都在打个人的，不打团体提的。打不到一块儿去啊，没有共同的目标.)  ``Hmm. Yes it does look like that.'' ``Hey, Lijie...'' she asked me quietly, ``...don’t you think they’re not even playing as well as our Shandong team could play?'' （嘿，李杰，是不是她们现在打的没有我们山东队打的好，是吧？）

As was common on my journeys through the world of rugby in China, I often did not quite grasp all the details and pieces of the puzzle that contextualised the interactions I was having until after the fact.

Later that day I bumped into LS, who had been assistant coach of China with LXH and now BG since 2014.  LS was a Qingdao local, a CAU graduate, and a member of the Beijing Men's team from 2010-2013.  I asked him about the current situation with the Chinese women's side and their prospects 6 weeks out from the first Olympic qualifier.  ``Chinese athletes need to see the (individual) benefits if they are going to put their bodies on the line and put in for each other'' he insisted, and he went on to explain why for these athletes, there were no obvious benefits available sufficient to motivate them.  There were indeed very few material benefits associated with representing China in rugby at the national level.  Athletes were payed a nominal USD100 per month on top of their provincial contracts when training and touring with the national program.  If athletes were injured while playing for China, CRFA at the time did not have access to sufficient health insurance to cover the costs of treatment, and athletes had no choice but to return to their provincial programs and seek treatment at the expense of the province.  The less tangible benefits of playing for China, for example, access to high quality coaching, or the pride of representing the country in a sport, or even the promise of a trip to the Olympics, were heavily outweighed by other less tangible costs: long stints of time away from family, the constant risk of falling out of favour with provincial programs...  In effect, the lack of incentives at the national level meant that athletes were by definition more committed to their provincial systems---the programs that provided athletes with the benefits that they were most interested in obtaining, such as tertiary education, future employment, modest but compared to CRFA, a reasonable salary (most national level players were paid 3-8k RMB/month). ``Its no wonder these athletes aren't performing well,'' LS exclaimed.

Cultural Modes of group membership and social cognition:

\subsection{Modes of group membership and self-construal}
An analysis of literature concerning the cultural psychology of self-construal can provide important insights into the way in which macro cultural processes interact with micro-dynamics of social interaction to structure and constrain cognitive processes implicated with joint action, team click, and social bonding.  As Anthropologists have emphasised for some time \citep{Strodtbeck1961,Kluckhohn1961,Mead1967,Fei1992}, and as cultural psychologists are now beginning to demonstrate in experimental paradigms, processes of group membership appear to vary cross-culturally \citep{Markus1991,Nisbett2001}.  Based on recent cross-cultural research, social and cultural psychologists have developed a theoretical spectrum of group membership processes, the two poles of which can be described as categorical and relational \citep{Hofstede1980,Brewer2007}.  Whereas some cultures, traditionally ``Western'' cultures such as the US, the core of self-definition is based on individual autonomy and separation from others.
The self-concept of relational societies, traditionally understood to be predominantly East Asian cultures, by contrast, is defined primarily based on social embeddedness and interdependence with others comprising their in-groups\citep{Leung2012}.

Unsurprisingly, much of Anglo-American social psychology of the 20th Century is rooted in a categorical mode of representing and measuring group membership.  The canonical self-categorisation paradigm of social psychology \citep{Turner1987}, for example, requires that a bounded individual (experimental subject) make an identification between abstract categories of the self and the in-group or out-group.  Categorical group membership is thus achieved when the perceived differences between the self and other in-group members are smaller than the differences between in-group and out-group members \citep{Yuki2014}.  In distinction to a categorical mode of group membership, relational group membership involves attention to maintaining and harmonising intragroup relationships, engaging in intergroup categorical comparisons \citep{Yuki2003}.
In a relational mode, social identity is less a function of distance between abstract categories of self and in-group, and more a degree of commitment to cultivating a network of hierarchically structured---but more or less self-centred and self-enhancing---network of relationships \citep{Liu2009,Nisbett2003}.

These two predominant modes of group membership—--categorical and relational—--have been shown to vary across cultures (i.e. East Asian versus Western European or North American, see \citep{Markus1991,Nisbett2001,Yuki2003}, within groups (according to sex and personality differences \citep{Yuki2014}, and indeed, within individuals (depending on contextual and situational primes, \citep{Lee2014,Wong2005}).  While the durable persistence of cultural and linguistic institutions appear to be responsible for the prominence of one mode of membership over another (East versus West, for example), recently researchers have suggested that divergent modes of group membership—categorical and relational—may be mediated by context-specific socio-ecological factors such as the level of relational mobility in any given environment \citep{Oishi2010,Takagishi2014,Yuki2005}.  Both modes of group membership have been shown to shape attention, cognition, and behaviour \citep{Nisbett2003} and as such have important implications for the task of identifying and measuring social bonding mechanisms of joint action

Experimental evidence suggests that categorical group processes facilitate fast and effective identification with arbitrary minimal groups \citep{Diehl1990,VanBavel2014}, the arousal of intrapersonal cognitive dissonance between the self and experimentally constructed in-group \citep{Festinger1957, Stone2001}, higher levels of cooperation with categorically similar strangers in economic games \citep{Yuki2005,Yuki2003}, and greater attention to and memory recall \citep{Buchan2006,Ng2016}.  In cultural environments where relational processes of group membership are more prominent or salient, on the other hand, the inverse is usually observed. First, minimal group paradigms have had very little (if any) success in East Asian (particularly Japanese) contexts \citep{Liu2009}.  Relational group processes, on the other hand, allow for the arousal of cognitive dissonance only when it is constructed interpersonally (as opposed to intrapersonally) between an individual and specific individuals to which that individual is connected by a meaningful social relationships \citep{Hoshino-Browne2005}.  Likewise, individuals with a predominantly relational group awareness are more willing to cooperate with and attend to strangers with whom they share relational rather than categorical ties \citep{Ng2016,Yuki2005}.

Relational group membership has a long history in China, rooted in Confucian \citep{Hwang1999}, folk-cultural axioms \citep{Wang2009}, agricultural modes of production \citep{Talhelm2014,Fei1992}, dynastic rule, and modern reinventions of these cultural forms by processes of the nation-state\citep{Liu2014}. The metaphor of the family is particularly salient and pervasive in modern public representations.  On almost every scale of social organisation, from dyadic extra-kin friendships through to workplace interactions and macro-social organisations (cities, provinces, nation), the family and its relational priorities are consistently invoked to aid coordination and coerce participation in collection action.
In addition, the last 150 years of Chinese modern history has also entailed the introduction of categorical group processes associated with the activities of the nation-state, leading to a contemporary Chinese indigenous psychology in which a relational mode is predominant, and a categorical mode is contextually-activated, especially when categories such as ``China'' are threatened or challenged internationally \citep{Liu2009}.

\subsection{Implications for the present study}
The literature reviewed above potentially poses an interesting challenge to the way in which social bonding is understood within cognitive and evolutionary anthropology.  The professional Chinese rugby players that form the focus of this dissertation are young men and women predominantly from rural areas of China's northeast, and are therefore likely subject to relational modes of group membership made predominant and durable by persistent cultural and linguistic processes associated with group membership in contemporary China \citep{Liu2009}.  In addition, athletes are members of a relatively small and stable team environment, for which access to benefits should require attention to the maintenance of productive intragroup relationships, more so than processes of intergroup mobility or comparison \citep{Schug2010}, even though intergroup comparison is an inherent component of competitive interactional team sport. However, given the fact that rugby is an imported team-based interactive sport, for which categorical modes of group membership are required and celebrated, I also expect athletes to exhibit a categorical mode of group membership.
In addition, I expect the metaphors of family to be prominent in the scaffolding of team processes, and I also expect to find a tension between loyalties to the team, and loyalties to an athlete's pre-existing relational networks of family and friends\citep{Yang1994}.  Thus, the specific cultural setting is such that I do not necessarily expect to encounter the type of public representation or testimony of group membership common in Western sporting parlance, more indigenous to the rugby pitches and boathouses of Oxford or any high school American Football movie produced in the 1990s.  Instead, I expect to find evidence of a link between joint action, team click, and social bonding expressed and embodied in cultural representations that may vary distinctly in structure and content from Western intuitions based on a predominantly categorical mode of social cognition.




\subsection{My history with rugby and China (Qualifications of the researcher)}
It had been two years since I had last spent a long period of time in China, the last time being in 2013 when I spent eight months coaching the Chinese men's youth rugby 7s team in the lead up to the Nanjing Asian Youth Olympics.  Before that, I had spent one year studying on Exchange at Beijing University in 2008, and another year before that on an intensive Chinese language course at Liaoning University, Shenyang, in 2006.  Rugby featured heavily in both instances.  In 2006, an Australian classmate and friend Ed had caught wind of the fact that there was a rugby program down the road from Liaoning University at the Shenyang Sports College (SSC).  Despite the fact that we had both been diligently attending class and courageously deploying our elementary Chinese to order food at restaurants and befriend local taxi drivers, Ed and I were, nonetheless, three months into our intensive language exchange and feeling that our Chinese skills were floundering.  We suspected that this was in large part due to the fact that we had met very few local Chinese people our age.  So one afternoon we rode our bikes over to the Shenyang Sports College in time for the rugby team's afternoon training session.  Less than six months later, we were boarding an overnight train from Shenyang to Shanghai with the SSC rugby team to compete in the annual Shanghai Rugby 7s Tournament.  We had become closely integrated into the community of rugby athletes at SSC, due in part to the common language of rugby that we all shared, and perhaps mostly due to the overwhelming hospitality of the SSC rugby team.  The decision to find the rugby team may have also helped us improve our Chinese. Ed and I were the only two in our cohort to finish the year in Shenyang with a Level 6 in the Chinese Proficiency Exam, which qualified us to study alongside Chinese local students at an undergraduate level.

Buoyed by this experience with the SSC rugby team in 2006, I followed a similar template two years later when I arrived at Beijing University on exchange from Sydney University to study sociology at Beijing University.  I had just finished working at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At that time in Beijing, the only Chinese rugby program was based out of the Chinese Agricultural University, a forty minute cycle north of Beijing University.  It was during my time training and generally ``hanging out'' at CAU that I met and developed a strong friendship with Kai, who was at the time playing for CAU and China, while also finishing a Master's degree in Labour Law.  I also met and developed relationships with many rugby players, coaches, and general fans of the Beijing rugby community.  The CAU rugby program was the strongest in the country: CAU consistently outperformed its rivals at the time (Shanghai Sports Institute, the People's Liberation Army, and SSC) and it was awarded with the responsibility of hosting the Chinese national team.  When the International Olympic Committee announced in late 2009 that rugby would be played in the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Olympics, it was subsequently decided in 2010 that rugby would be inducted into the the state sponsored sports system and played in the next Chinese National Games in 2013.  Following this announcement, many of CAU's athletes and coaches dispersed to various professional provincial rugby programs, the main ones being Beijing and Shandong.

Between 2009 and 2013 I returned to Australia to finish my undergraduate degree, during which time my own rugby career also rapidly developed. After a successful season in the Sydney premiership competition in 2009, I was selected to play for the Australian Rugby Sevens team. I represented Australia in Sevens from 2009 through to the end of 2012.  In 2013, during the 9 month gap between my Australian rugby contract ending and the start of my graduate studies at Oxford University, I returned to China to coach the Chinese Youth Men's 7s program in their lead-up to the 2013 Nanjing Asian Youth Olympics.  Along with a small team of Chinese coaches and management, I coached a core group of roughly 25 athletes aged between 15 and 18 years old. Our athletes trained 6 days a week for approximately 6 months, with only occasional breaks for National holidays, or for athletes to return to their home provinces to complete compulsory exams.  The program was based predominantly in Anhui province, and we travelled from Anhui to other provinces further afield to find suitable practice opportunities against provincial programs.  Soon after the completion of the Asian Youth Olympics in Nanjing, the Chinese National Games were held in Shenyang. Rugby was played for the first time in National Games history, with dramatic consequences.



\section{The Beijing provincial men's rugby team}
I focus my ethnography on the Beijing provincial men's rugby team ($n=26, avg. age=21.3, range = 17-27, SD = 2.96$).  The Beijing provincial men's and women's rugby programs are based at the Xiannongtan Sports Institute in Beijing (one of Beijing's four major sports institutes, and home to seven different full-time sports programs, hereafter Xiannongtan).  These athletes represent Beijing at a provincial level, playing against other provinces in annual tournaments, and every four years at the all-important National Games.  Five athletes have previously represented China in international rugby sevens tournaments.  There is also a Beijing women's rugby team at Xiannongtan, but I was not able to accompany the activities of both teams closely enough to perform adequate ethnographic research.

Members of the Beijing men's rugby sevens team are either already-contracted (n=13) or aspiring professional athletes (n=13) who live and train 6 days a week at Xiannongtan and occasionally attend university or high school classes as part of their ongoing education---what can only be termed part-time education.  A head coach and assistant coach look after the day to day organisation of team schedules and training, and these two coaches are assisted by a further two player-coaches, who are in the gradual process of moving from athlete to coach status.  One of Xiannongtan's four principals is responsible for the management and administration of the rugby program, and is occasionally present at team meetings and national competitions.

Athletes are all from relatively modest socio-economic backgrounds, many hailing from suburban and rural areas of northern China (Shandong (11), Beijing (6), Jiangsu (3), Liaoning (2), Hebei (2), Anhui (1), Henan (1), Heilongjiang (1)).  The squad consists of 10 fully contracted senior athletes (\textit{xieyi}), three provisionally-contracted athletes \textit{shixun}, and six student-athletes \textit{erjiban} who do not receive a salary but receive training, food, board, and educational support.  The remaining athletes (7) are classed as athletes in training \textit{jixun} and are effectively on trial until they either show promise or withdraw from the squad either voluntarily or upon suggestion by the head coach.  Provided that they meet the relevant academic and athletic requirements, contracted and student athletes are able to attend the Beijing Sports University—considered to be the country's most prestigious sports university and one of China's ``top brand universities'' (\textit{mingpai daxue}).

The average rugby training age (years spent playing rugby) of Beijing athletes is 3.12 years ($range = 0.16 – 10 years$).  Contracted senior athletes ($average age = 24.3 years$) have trained for an average of 5.4 years, whereas the average training age of junior non-contracted athletes (average age = 19.3 years) was 1.7 years.  Over half of the athletes have a background in other sports (15 athletes from track and field, one from football, one from basketball), usually beginning part-time or full-time physical training at the age of 11-13.  Those who transferred to rugby did so either at the beginning of senior high school (16 years) or at university age (18yrs).  The rest of the group had no particular sporting background before starting at Xiannongtan, and were scouted by school athletics coaches based on their basic athletic attributes (running speed, strength, coordination, and potential for physical growth).  Of the 26 athletes in the squad, three junior athletes who were part of the squad when I arrived in September 2015 have now left, and three new athletes have arrived. This movement of non-contracted players in and out for trials is quite common.

\subsubsection{Training schedule}
Every year between April and September there are five national tournaments held in different locations across the country.  October –-- February constitutes the off- and pre-seasons for these yearly competitions, during which time teams travel to domestic or international training locations depending on amount of program funding and training strategy.  In 2015, before an unexpected change in coaching team at the end of December, plans were to travel to Yunnan in the new year province for altitude training (January) before moving to sea-level somewhere in the south (February/March).  Following the coaching leadership change, the team did not leave Beijing until after Chinese New Year (15th February), which meant that training during this period was influenced by Beijing's cold winter weather and air pollution.

Below is a table of a typical weekly training schedule. A typical week consists of 10x2.5hr training sessions, three of which are strength and conditioning sessions, seven of which are on-field rugby sessions.  In addition, two one hour evening skills sessions are also added for junior athletes to hone their basic skills of passing, catching, and game-play.  Athletes live full-time on campus at XNT in dormitory accommodation (usually 3 athletes per ensuite room), and are permitted leave on the weekend after the conclusion of Saturday morning training.  Athletes with family in Beijing usually take this leave, while the remaining athletes spend weekends at XNT.  Athletes break at the end of season (September) for two weeks, and occasionally around Chinese New Year for 7-10 days, unless New Year interrupts pre-season training plans, in which case training continues throughout.

\section{Research methods}
Ethnographic data included: unstructured and semi-structured interviews with athletes and coaches (yet to be analysed in-depth), general and activity-specific surveys, and field notes based on participant observation of daily activities of the team.


\subsubsection{Participant observation}
For 6 months in 2015-16 and 6 weeks in summer 2016, I lived and trained full time with the team at XNT, during which time I took daily field notes using a note taking application (Evernote, version 6.11), which was synced between my mobile phone and personal computer. I collated, summarised, and tagged these notes weekly or fortnightly.

\subsubsection{Interviews}
In addition to ad-hoc unstructured interviews with athletes, coaches, and other officials XNT officials and individuals in the Chinese rugby community (n = 15), I conducted 26 semi-structured interviews, each lasting between 15 and 70 minutes.  All interviews were conducted in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) and were recorded with participant consent using a sound recording application on my smartphone or laptop computer.

During semi-structured interviews, I asked athletes about their personal background (including their family situation), their motivations for adherence to rugby, perceived costs and benefits of adherence to rugby, their perceptions of role in the team, their experience of playing rugby (particularly feelings of flow, dissonance, and team click).  The structured interviews also involved two tasks, one in which the athlete was required to rank motivations for adherence to rugby, and one in which the athlete was asked to report their three closest friends in the team, the three team members most willing to sacrifice on behalf of the team, and three most competent athletes in the team (see Appendix for full script). Athletes answered these questions using a pen and paper. I later collated and uploaded these responses to Evernote.


\subsubsection{Surveys}
 I conducted a number of informal surveys designed to understand athletes' general and specific experiences group membership.  I conducted surveys following three training sessions: a session in which athletes (predominantly junior athletes) ran an aerobic fitness test involving straight-line running shuttle-running at and above the aerobic threshold (Beep Test), and two training sessions involving internal game-like scenarios.  In addition, I asked athletes about their general experiences of team membership agency over the team (weak-strong), role in the team (central-marginal), individual performance (weak-strong), team performance (weak-strong), training intensity (\textit{qiangdu})(light-heavy) at two three-month intervals.

I arrived in Beijing late on a Friday evening at the end of August in 2015.  My close friend Kai---a former Chinese National rugby team representative, and now a lawyer working in Beijing---picked me up at the airport and drove me back to his home.  The plan was to stay with Kai until I was able to make solid arrangements with the Beijing Temple of Agriculture Sports Institute, the home of the Beijing Provincial Rugby Team.

After a day of acclimatising and running errands, on Saturday evening I was invited to a dinner hosted by Adrian, a respected elder within the Chinese rugby community of Beijing.  Adrian was the captain of the second ever class of rugby players to graduate from the Chinese Agricultural University in Beijing---the birthplace of rugby in China.
I first met Adrian through Kai in 2013,

 while coaching in China.  I was originally introduced to Adrian by Kai, a close friend of mine who I met earlier during another stint in Beijing in 2008.

 Kai was also at the dinner, as was Mr Shi, a sports television producer at Chinese Central Television (CCTV).  CCTV had just accepted the rights to the Rugby World Cup, which World Rugby---the international governing body of rugby---had made available to CCTV in an attempt to promote the development of the game in non-traditional rugby playing nations.


I arrived in Beijing late on a Friday evening at the end of August in 2015.  My close friend Kai---a former Chinese rugby player, graduate the Chinese Agricultural University (Chinese rugby's birthplace), and now a lawyer working in Beijing---met me at the airport and drove me back to his home.  When we got to his home, Kai turned on the television and we caught up while some footage from a rugby documentary played in the background.  As it so happened, the international rugby world was on the verge of another Rugby World Cup, which was being hosted by England in the coming months. World Rugby, the world governing body of rugby union, had made the television broadcast rights for the World Cup available to Chinese Central Television (CCTV), in an attempt to promote the game globally.  Having accepted the rights to the tournament, which is the 3rd largest sporting event in the world behind the Olympics and the Football World Cup, CCTV were in search of Chinese rugby experts to help produce the 48-match tournament.  As Kai quickly explained, CCTV's search had led them to the Chinese rugby community based in Beijing, who were almost all, like Kai, graduates of the Chinese Agricultural University---the birthplace of rugby in China and the base for the Chinese National Rugby team between 1996 and 2010.  In fact, CCTV's search led them first to Adrian, the captain of one of the first CAU rugby teams (1992), and currently working for a large international sport organisation in Beijing.  Adrian had then contacted his younger university brother (师弟) Kai, who like him was fluent in English and able to assist in sourcing and translating rugby materials relevant to the broadcast. The CCTV producer responsible for the broadcast, Mr Shi, had scheduled a dinner with Adrian and Kai on Saturday (tomorrow) night to thank them for their willingness to assist in the production.  I was also invited to the dinner. I wasn't scheduled to meet with the Principle and head coach of the Beijing Temple of Agriculture Sports Institute until the following Monday, so I agreed to accompany Kai.
