\subsection{Experiment condition primes\label{app9:conditionPrime}}

\subsubsection{High difficulty condition prime\label{app9:conditionPrimeHigh}}
\textit{The drill you will be participating in today is a ``4 on 2 + 2'' drill taken from World Rugby.  This drill, also known as ``Invasion Drill'' involves four attackers and two phases of two defenders in a 15m x 22m channel.  The other group will be participating in a different type of drill.  International coaches have assessed this drill based on a number of different factors (including drill complexity, coordination, intensity, skill requirement, etc.), and a sample of professional rugby players from all over the world, including China, have rated this drill based on its difficulty.  World Rugby has combined these two measures and concluded that it is a very difficult drill for players to perform together successfully.  This drill was given a score of 77.5/100, which translates to a difficulty rating of about 8/10.  So the requirements of this drill—in coordinating both attack and defence—are quite high.}

\subsubsection{\label{app9:conditionPrimeLow}Low difficulty condition}
\textit{The drill you will be participating in today is a ``4 on 2 + 2'' drill taken from World Rugby.  This drill, also known as ``Invasion Drill'' involves four attackers and two phases of two defenders in a 15m x 22m channel.  The other group will be participating in a different type of drill.  International coaches have assessed this drill based on a number of different factors (including drill complexity, coordination, intensity, skill requirement, etc.), and a sample of professional rugby players from all over the world, including China, have rated this drill based on its difficulty.  World Rugby has combined both of these measures and concluded that it is a very easy drill for players to perform together successfully.  This drill was given a score of 22.5/100, which translates to a difficulty rating of about 2/10.  So the requirements of this drill—in coordinating both attack and defence—are quite low.}


\subsection{Invasion Drill pilot to derive approximate actual difficulty rating for the Invasion Drill\label{app9:difficultyPilot}}
20 junior athletes from the Beijing provincial team ($male = 10,  M(age) = 18 (SD = 2.1)$) were recruited to participate in a pilot study designed to test the difficulty rating of the Invasion Drill.  Two separate pilot sessions were conducted, one with the men and another with the women.  Following a routine warm-up procedure not involving a rugby ball ($\sim10$ minutes), athletes in each session completed 28 rounds of the Invasion Drill.  Given that the drill required only 8 athletes, all 10 athletes rotated through two extra ``resting'' positions on the sideline of the drill.  The Invasion Drill was also preceded by a more simple ``2 on 1 + 1'' attacking drill and then succeeded by a more complex ``6 on 4 continuous'' attacking drill.  Athletes who were not required to participate in the 2 on 1 + 1 drill rested on the sideline of the drill and rotated with athletes after each trial.  All ten athletes were engaged in the 6 on 4 continuous drill, and positions within these drills were rotated so that athletes performed each position in each drill.  At the end of the training session, athletes were asked to privately record the perceived difficulty of each training drill from the pilot session using a ten-point scale (0 - ``Extremely easy'', 5 - ``Average'', 10 - ``Extremely difficult''). These results were collected and collated by the researcher.

On average, athletes rated the Invasion Drill at 4.7/10 (range = 3 to 7).  The more simple ``2 on 1+1'' attacking drill received an average rating of 2 (range = 1-4), and the more complex ``6 on 4 continuous'' attacking drill received an average rating of 6.2 (range = 4-10). Ratings of perceived difficulty did not noticeably vary by pilot group. This pilot study confirmed that it was appropriate to estimate the actual difficulty rating of the invasion drill at approximately 5/10. The high difficulty manipulation (8/10) and the low difficulty rating (2/10) could fall evenly at either side of this difficulty.



\subsection{\label{app9:drillExplanation}Drill explanation (constant across both conditions)}

\textit{
The drill will work as follows:  when I blow the whistle, the first group of four attackers will assemble on the diamond pattern of four cones and prepare to attack, while two lines of two defenders each will assemble on the assigned cones, 10m apart from each other.  When I blow the whistle a second time, the ball carrier at the top of the attacking diamond will tap the ball on his/her foot and proceed to engage the attack in a 4on2 scenario.  The goal of the attacking group is to penetrate both lines of defence without being held by the defenders.  After participating in the first line of defence, the first two defenders must stay put, and cannot follow the play and participate in the second line of defence.
}

\textit{
Defenders can ``hold/hug'' attackers in order to hold the attack, but the drill is not a full-contact drill.  Attackers can offload the ball at the first opportunity after making contact with a defender, if they are not fully held by the defenders.  If the attacker does not unload the ball immediately, then the play is dead and the drill will be reset.
}


\textit{
After every phase I will ask athletes to rotate clockwise around the drill, such that the ball carrier at the top of the diamond goes on to become a defender on the top right side of the square of defenders. Each individual athlete should attack a total of 8 rounds, and defend a total of 8 rounds, performing every position in the drill twice.}

\textit{
The drill will be recorded using a digital video camera, and individual athletes will be assessed based on their performance in attack and defence, using special video analysis software. I am particularly interested in how well players are able to coordinate with others in attack and defence.
}



\subsection{Survey items\label{app9:surveyItems}}

\subsubsection{Baseline\label{app9:surveyItemsBaseline}}

\myparagraph{Perceptions of performance}
Survey items relating to performance included questions regarding athlete perceptions of their 1) overall team performance, 2) specific components of team performance, 3) overall individual performance, and 4) specific components of individual performance.  These items were identical to those asked in the Pre-Tournament survey in Chapter ~\ref{chap:tournamentSurvey}.

\myparagraph{Team Click}
Athletes were asked about their feelings concerning team click among the entire provincial squad over the past month. Items included here were equivalent to survey items administered in the Tournament Survey (see Appendix ~\ref{app5:clickPre}).

\myparagraph{Social Bonding}
Athletes were asked about their perceptions of social bonding to their team over the past month, including perceived emotional support and shared goal, identity fusion (pictorial scale and 7 item verbal scale), and group identification (six-item scale). In addition, athletes were also asked about identity fusion to country and family, measured using the pictorial fusion scale, and were then asked to rank their level of fusion to team, country, and family in order of most fused to least fused.  For full description of survey items, see Appendix~\ref{app5:bondingPre})

\myparagraph{Technical Competence}
Athletes were asked about their individual technical competence, which included both objective and subjective measures (these measures were equivalent to items administered in the Tournament Survey, see Appendix~\ref{app5:technicalCompetence}).

\myparagraph{Ten Item Personality Index}
Athletes were asked to indicate on a 7-point Likert scale the extent to which they agreed with 10 pairs of adjectives as appropriate descriptions of their personality (see Appendix~\ref{app5:TIPI} for full description).

\myparagraph{Additional items}
Athletes answered items relating to team discipline, injury status, and basic identification variables (for full description, see Appendix ~\ref{app5:teamDisciplinePre} to~\ref{app5:IDVariables}).


%\subsubsection{Pre-Drill survey items\label{app9:surveyItemsPre}}
%Survey items administered Pre-Drill (following the experimental manipulation and immediately prior to the experiment) included items designed to measure athletes' 1) perceptions of and confidence in individual and training group performance, 2) team click and social bonding to the training group (but not the team as a whole beyond the immediate training group).  In addition to these items, the time 2 survey also asked about current injury status, and state of arousal, and fatigue.


\subsubsection{Post-Drill surveys items\label{app9:surveyItemsPost}}
The final survey, administered immediately following the experiment, consisted of items designed to assess athlete perceptions of individual and group performance in the experiment relative to prior expectations, as well as perceptions of team click and social bonding to the training group.  Athletes were asked if they would prefer to stay with their existing group or change to a new group for subsequent training experiments.

In addition to these group-specific items, the Post-Drill survey also included items regarding social bonding to the team as a whole (beyond an athlete's specific training group), in order to assess any change in these measures due to their experience of joint action in the experiment.  Finally, the Post-Drill survey also asked about current injury status and state of arousal and fatigue.

%\subsubsection{Additional Variables\label{app9:additionalVariables}}

%%teamDiscipline
%%\input{images/teamDisciplineTimeLowTraining.tex}

%The central tendencies of subjective measures of individual technical competence compared to teammates, other Chinese professional rugby players, and International professionals, were all above the mid-point of the zero-centred scale (min = -50, max = 50), with average scores ranging from  a low of 14.11 ($SD = 26.88$) for perceived technical competence relative to International professionals recorded at Baseline in the low difficulty condition (100 point zero-centred scale, min = -50, max = 50), to a high of 25.41 (15.49) for perceived technical competence relative to teammates, recorded at Baseline in the high-difficulty condition.

%The central tendencies for items concerning the impact of individual performance on mood and confidence were also well above the mid-point of the scale, between 66-70 (SD range = 15.49 to 26.88) (100 point scale, min = 0, max = 100).

\subsubsection{Team Discipline\label{app9:teamDisciplineEFA}}
Items concerning team discipline (attendance at meals, team curfew, general team conduct, punctuality to team engagements), measured at baseline and after the experiment, were subjected to EFA.  Correlations between items were all reasonably high (all $r's > .63$), which suggested that one factor would be appropriate (see Table ~\ref{tab:teamDisciplineCorrTable}).
The KMO index and Bartlett's test both suggested high sampling adequacy, ($KMO = .78, \chi^2(6, 116) = 362.75, p < .0001$).  One factor, labelled ``Team Discipline'' was imposed on the data, which explained 73.9\% of the overall variance
($ SS Loading = 2.96, Guttman's \lambda = .96 and Cronbach's \alpha = .92$ indicated that the data reduction was appropriate and reliable.


%\myparagraph{Fatigue\label{app9:fatigueEFA}}
%Fatigue (exertion) is measured pre and post experiment, but mental and prpe are measured only Post-Drill, so there was no need for EFA.

%\subsection{Pre- to Post-Drill\label{sect:prePostDrillFactors}}
%LMER models were used to model variation in key variables of interest (group component performance, team click, and social bonding) over time (Pre- to Post-Drill).  Owing to the repeated measures structure of the data (the same individual was sampled twice, once at Pre-Drill and once at Post-Drill), individual athlete was included with and experiment session as random a intercept (slopes were not modelled due to insufficient sample size).  Time, condition, and their interaction were included as main effects.

%Models revealed significant negative main effects of time on:

%\begin{itemize}
  %\item Team click with training group ($\betavec -.44 \CIstart -.76, -.12 \CIfinish \SE .16, t(58.19) = -2.69, \pvalue .009 $)
  %\item Social bonding with training group ($\betavec -.20 \CIstart -.40, -.01 \CIfinish \SE .10, t(56.91) = -2.07, \pvalue .04$)
%\end{itemize}




 %but no significant main effects of condition on group performance relative to prior expectations ($\betavec .36 \CIstart -1.27, 2.09 \CIfinish \SE .88, t(115) = .41, \pvalue .68$),

 %team click, ($\betavec -.18 \CIstart -1.45, 1.10 \CIfinish \SE .65, t(59.44) = -.27, \pvalue .79 $) or team bonding ($\betavec .42 \CIstart -.44, 1.28 \CIfinish \SE .44, t(37.23) = .97, \pvalue .34$).


%Interaction effects were also not significant for group performance relative to prior expectations ($\betavec -.11 \CIstart -.79, .57 \CIfinish \SE .35, t(115) = -.33, \pvalue .74 $),team click, ($\betavec .12 \CIstart -.34, .57 \CIfinish \SE .23, t(57.81) = .50, \pvalue .62$)or group bonding ($\betavec -.09 \CIstart -.37, .18 \CIfinish \SE .14, t(56.73) = -.68, \pvalue .50$).
