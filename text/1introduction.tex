\section{The carnal mystery of group exercise \label{sect:adrian}}


On my first night in Beijing, Adrian, Kai, and sat in the upstairs area of the Korean BBQ restaurant in a quiet willow lined street just inside Beijing's East 4th Ring Road.  Adrian, the host of the dinner, naturally held the floor in conversation while the three of us waited for his colleague Mr Shi to arrive.

Adrian was a veritable elder of Chinese rugby. He had been captain of the second class of rugby players to graduate from the Chinese Agricultural University (CAU), the home of China's first official rugby union program, established in 1990. Kai---also a CAU graduate (2007)---was a close friend of mine of many years, and he had invited me to join at the dinner.  I was eager to catch up with old friends as well as begin my fieldwork, and so, despite my jet lag, I accepted the invitation.

Adrian reminisced fondly about his time playing rugby at CAU, as well as his time after graduation playing with the Beijing Devils, a rugby club in Beijing whose members were predominantly expats.  He assured us that rugby in China was, in those days, fun and free-spirited.  Not like today, now that Chinese rugby has become a professional program in the state-sponsored sport system (owing to the Olympic status of the modified form of the game, rugby sevens, see Chapter ~\ref{chap:researchSetting}).  Adrian talked about going on a rugby tour to the UK with the Beijing Devils:  ``Everyone only just scraped together the money to go on tour.  We all paid our own way. Sometimes you'd get a bit of help from someone or whatever. We did it because we loved the game, not for any other reason.''   Kai and I listened intently.  All of a sudden I realised that this conversation could be relevant, so I started taking notes.

When Mr Shi finally arrived, Adrian continued his nostalgic story telling mode, but naturally shifted his target audience from Kai and me to Mr Shi---who knew very little about rugby.  Adrian began to describe in rich detail the experience of camaraderie between he and his Beijing Devils team mates when they participated in overseas rugby tour.  But he then interrupted his own story to make an explanatory aside directed at Mr Shi, accommodating for the fact that Mr Shi was relatively unacquainted with the sport: ``This sport, rugby: it's actually very mysterious. If you haven't played it yourself you might not know this type of feeling,'' Adrian respectfully suggested to Mr Shi.  ``Because rugby, you know, you're all on the field together, there's body contact...'' he paused to find the right phrasing,  ``It's a very \textit{carnal} type of feeling.''  His attempts to enrich his communication by gesticulating had led him to have both of his hands clenched as fists in front of him like they were cradling a rugby ball or gripping the steering wheel of a car---a lit cigarette smouldering between the index and middle finger of his right hand.  Adrian concluded by looking into the distance and repeating: ``Its very mysterious.'' He shook his head as if baffled and finally released his clenched fists to dab the ash from his cigarette into the ashtray in front of him.  After taking another drag from his cigarette he finally added: ``So it means this rugby circle here in China is very tight...''---a short pause for another dab of his cigarette--- ``...but it doesn't mean that this circle is not also not also complete chaos!''
  \footnote{Circle (\textit{quanzi} 圈子) is a common colloquial way to refer to a social group or community of people in modern standard Chinese.}
The wisdom of Adrians's final punchline was confirmed with a knowing chuckle from all of us, including Mr Shi. Adrian concluded his performance silently, by taking a long, satisfying drag of his cigarette and looking off into the most distant corner of the restaurant.

%英式橄榄球这个项目其实特别神秘，没玩过的话您可能不知道这种感觉，因为英式橄榄球么，大家在场上有身体接触，是一种``肉''的感觉，大家互相都特别亲，特别神秘。
%所以在橄榄球这个圈子特别亲, 但这不是说这个圈儿也不乱！

I was captivated---but also somewhat surprised---by Adrian's monologue.  I was not expecting, so early into my fieldwork, to happen upon a declaration in which a link between the carnal (\textit{rou} 肉) sensations associated with on-field joint action, and social processes of interpersonal emotional affiliation (\textit{qin} 亲) and group cohesion of the rugby community (\textit{quanzi} 圈子) was so explicitly and spontaneously emphasised.  It was clear that rugby's visceral dimension continued to capture Adrian emotionally; some fifteen years after he had finished playing his fists still clenched with energy, and his head still shook with amazement.

I was also intrigued that Adrian cited the source of his emotional capture as at once both very specific (derived from playing together with others on the field) and, at the same time, ultimately ``mysterious.''  The aim of my research is to contribute to an explanation the human behavioural phenomenon of group exercise in terms of its social, evolutionary, cognitive, and physiological causal processes and dynamics.  In essence, the aim is to somehow move from mystery to scientific mechanism.  At this first dinner in Beijing, Adrian's comments both captured the phenomenological mystery of group exercise, and pointed me in the direction of the underlying scientific mechanisms.

Needless to say, I left that first dinner eager to investigate the sources of Adrian's experience of mysterious carnality and social connection in rugby's joint action.  My next stop, on Monday morning, was the Temple of God of Agriculture Sports Institute, where I began ethnographic research with the Beijing Provincial rugby program.

\section{The puzzle of group exercise}
Competitive team sports, whirling Sufi dervishes, late-night electronic music raves, Masi ceremonial dances, or the fitness cults of Cross-fit and Soul Cycle---endless examples can be plucked from across cultures and throughout time to exemplify the human compulsion to come together and move together.  How can we explain the prevalence of these activities in the human record?  In this dissertation I contribute to a scientific understanding of ``group exercise''---defined herein as physiologically exertive and socially coordinated movement---by way of a focussed study of the social cognition of joint action among professional Chinese rugby players.

Because physical movement is a metabolically expensive task, it is justifiable from an evolutionary standpoint only if the benefits somehow outweigh the costs.  Using this basic calculus, it is easy to imagine how group exercise would have served important survival functions in our ancestral past.  Activities involving group exercise such as hunting, travel, communication, and defence all appear to confer immediate and obvious benefits to individuals and groups \citep{Sands2010}.

In more recent domains of human history, however, the task of explaining the persistent recurrence of group exercise is more complicated.  At least since the late Pleistocene era (approx. 500ka), and particularly since the Holocene transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural (approx. 11ka), and later industrial and post-industrial societies, group exercise can be identified in shared cultural practices as varied as religion, organised warfare, music, dance, play, and sport.  But unlike group hunting or defence, the fitness-relevant benefits of group exercise in cultural practices such as sport, music, or dance are not always as obvious.  On the contrary, many of these activities appear on the face of it to entail extreme time and energy costs for very little immediate reward.

Thus, the prevalence of group exercise in a diverse array of shared cultural practices in the more recent human record presents an evolutionary puzzle.  A solution to this puzzle requires a more nuanced calculus that incorporates an appreciation of humans' species-unique evolutionary trajectory, defined by increasingly complex cognitive and cultural capacities, including technical manipulation of extra-somatic materials and ecologies; advanced theory of mind; and information-rich, malleable, and scalable communication systems \citep{Roepstorff2010,Clark2015,Fuentes2016}.  A theory capable of satisfactorily explaining group exercise within humans' distinctive evolutionary parameters is yet to be fully formulated \citep{Cohen2017}.

In this dissertation, I advance existing cognitive and evolutionary understandings of group exercise by formulating and testing a novel theoretical relationship between joint action and social bonding.  Existing theories of group exercise and social bonding fail to satisfactorily account for the variation in, and complexity of, interpersonal movement coordination common to many real world settings of group exercise.  I concentrate on the cognitive mechanisms and system dynamics of ``joint action,'' defined as any form of social interaction whereby two or more individuals coordinate their actions in space and time to bring about a change in the environment \citep{Sebanz2006}. I draw particular attention to the social and psychological effects known to occur when joint action functions successfully---i.e., when joint action ``clicks'' between co-actors.  I propose the phenomenon of ``team click'' as a candidate construct that can help explain a hitherto under-appreciated causal pathway between joint action and social bonding.

I test this novel theory of joint action and social bonding through a series of three empirical studies with professional Chinese rugby players. These studies include 1) an ethnographic study of the Beijing men's rugby team (Chapters~\ref{chap:ethnoSetting}\nobreakdash~\ref{chap:ethnoResults}), 2) an \textit{in situ} survey study of athletes during a National Rugby Tournament (Chapter~\ref{chap:tournamentSurvey}), and 3) a controlled field experiment with a sample of athletes across two provincial programs (Chapter~\ref{chap:trainingExperiment}).  In each of these studies I find evidence in support of the predictions of this dissertation.  Invariably, more positive perceptions of joint action predict higher levels of perceived team click; higher levels of team click predict higher levels of social bonding, and in some instances, the construct of team click mediates a direct positive relationship between perceptions of joint action and social bonding.  These findings offer initial substantiation of a novel theory of joint action and social bonding in group exercise.

In this chapter, I review existing theories of group exercise and social cohesion (Section ~\ref{sect:existingGESoCo}), and point to empirical knowledge gaps that require attention (Section ~\ref{sect:empKnowGaps}). In particular, I identify the under-theorised relationship between successful performance of complex joint action and perceptions of team click.  I then preview the main components of this dissertation (Section ~\ref{sect:components}), and conclude with an outline of the chapters of the dissertation (Section ~\ref{sect:chapters}).



\subsection{Existing scientific explanations of group exercise\label{sect:GESoCo}}

In this section I outline existing cognitive and evolutionary accounts of group exercise.  In this dissertation, I define group exercise broadly as any activity that minimally entails 1) sustained physical exercise (i.e. physical activity that reaches at least low intensity physiological exertion of 45\% of max heart rate or above), and 2) coordination of behaviour between two or more individuals in time and space to bring about change in the environment \citep[a.k.a., joint action, see][]{Sebanz2006}.  A broad definition of this nature allows for the identification of group exercise in a wide array of contexts in the human record, from music making and dance, to ritual practices, to competitive sport, warfare, play, and even pair-bonding activities such as sexual intercourse.  Anecdotal and ethnographic evidence pertaining to humans' subjective experience of all of these activities suggests that they invariably contain a prominent and unmistakable visceral dimension, for which existing scientific accounts struggle to adequately account.

\subsubsection{Group exercise in our evolutionary past}
It appears that human’s capacity for group exercise runs deep into our evolutionary trajectory.  Humans have evolved distinct morphological and physiological adaptations that enable sustained aerobic exercise.  Adaptations include derived skeletal features that support sustained and stable bipedal running and respirattory function \citep[see ][]{Bramble2004}, and exercise-specific neurobiological reward \citep{Raichlen2012}.  The archeological record indicates that a capacity for sustained physical exercise may have emerged at some point in the transition from Pan (i.e., Australopithecus) to Homo, and could be associated with activities such as persistence hunting, defence of territory, and communication over vast distances such as those conceivable in woodland or grassland savanna, as opposed to dense canopy rainforests  \citep{Sands2012}.
    \footnote{While sapiens, Erectus, and Habilis all appear to show evidence of morphological adaptation for running, these members of Homo lineage are not born sprinters.  Even elite human sprinters (capable of sustaining maximum speeds of only 10.2ms-1 for less than 15s) are slow compared to mammalian cursorial specialists such as horses, greyhounds and antelopes, who can maintain maximum galloping speeds of 15–20ms21 for several minutes \citep{Garland1983}.  Moreover, running is more costly for humans than for most mammals, demanding roughly twice as much metabolic energy per distance travelled than is typical for a mammal of equal body mass \citep{Taylor1982}.  This suggests that humans have evolved capacities suited specifically to endurance running at moderate intensities, rather than short bouts of high intensity sprinting \citep{Bramble2004}.}

The co-occurence of physical exertion with joint action has been identified in activities of non-human primates, suggesting that the human propensity for group exercise scaffolds on top of strong evolutionary foundations laid well before our last common ancestor with Chimpanzees.  Group hunting in Chimpanzees is by now well-documented and is known to be both spontaneous, highly organised \citep[for example involving divisions of set roles][]{Boesch1989}, and causally linked to social bonding \citep{Mitani2001}.  Chimpanzees behave similarly in group territorial ``warfare'' against members of neighbouring groups \citep{Boehm1992,Watts2001}.
In addition to group hunting and territorial conflicts, Chimpanzees also engage in exertive group activities such as group laughter \citep{Waller2005}, or coordinated display patterns of tree buttress drumming, pant-hooting, and branch-dragging \citep[for example, observed as part of a "rain dance”, see][]{Goodall1971,Whiten2001}.  Meanwhile, bonobos display a propensity for highly arousing socio-sexual encounters, which are hypothesised to quell intra-and inter-group tensions relating to competition over food or reproductive resources by activating neuropharmacological reward mechanisms \citep{Dunbar1992,Parr2005,Clay2015}.  Taken together, this evidence suggests that group exercise a core underpinning to various adaptive social behaviours in non-human primates, ranging from hunting, to group defence, and even social affiliation and diplomacy.

\subsubsection{Group exercise in our more recent past}
Social scientists and anthropologists \citep[see, for example][]{Durkheim1965} have long speculated that cultural activities featuring group exercise were somehow central to social function. Emile Durkheim emphasised the emotional importance of shared ritual practice, which he thought could ``change the conditions of psychic activity'' (p. 469).  This group-level property of ``collective effervescence,'' Durkheim argues, ``strengthen[s] the bonds attaching the individual to the society'' and has important behavioural consequences relating to prosociality and well-being (Durkheim 1915/1965; pp. 257-258). ''Once the individuals are gathered together,'' Durkheim notes of an indigenous Australian tribe engaged in ritual dance, ``a sort of \textit{electricity} is generated from their closeness and quickly launches them to an extraordinary height of exaltation...’’  As a compliment to his more famous essay on the role of shared cultural practices (in this case the ``Kula exchange'') in generating ties of social reciprocity \citep[i.e., ``The Gift''][]{Mauss2000}, Marcel Mauss (Durkheim's nephew) also drew attention to the importance of ``Techniques of the Body'' as a mediator of human social life \citep{Mauss1935}.
    \footnote{In fact, the intuition that the body is at the centre of social processes has been developed throughout an entire social scientific lineage, of which phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty \citep{Merleau-Ponty1956}, anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu \citep{Bourdieu1990}, and contemporary sociologist Loic Wacquant \citep{Wacquant2004} are all direct descendants.  All of these scholars fixate on the causal relevance of ``embodied practice'' to social phenomena.}
Meanwhile, Victor Turner drew attention to the way in which the drama of ritual performance (invariably involving group exercise) creates a liminal space separate from the usual structure of everyday social life in which ``spontaneous communitas'' and ``humankindness'' between ritual participants is fostered.  In all of these accounts, there is a common fixation on a relationship between embodied physical (carnal?) processes and social processes.

Thus, while these accounts of group exercise in human sociality lacked an a rigorous scientific framework and verifiable explanatory mechanisms, the importance of group exercise to human sociality was nonetheless intuitively grasped and duly emphasised.

\subsubsection{The temporary disappearance of group exercise amidst the  modern evolutionary synthesis and the cognitive revolution}

Generally speaking, rigorous and testable accounts of human behaviour have emerged only in the last \sim70 years.  Enabled by 1) the gradual refinement of evolutionary now known as the ``modern evolutionary synthesis'' (hereafter MES) and 2) the so called ``cognitive revolution'' (hereafter CR) of the 1950s and 60s, human behaviour was subjected to scientific analysis.  The MES, which involved a unification of the theory of evolution by natural selection (attributed to Darwin and Wallace in the second half of the 19th century) with a theory of genetic inheritance (replacing a previously popular theory of blended inheritance), paved the way for a definition of biological change as changes in the frequency of heritable DNA sequences in a population due to selection pressures exerted at the level of the phenotype \citep{Grafen1984}.  Meanwhile, metaphors deriving from information theory, cybernetics, and computation provided the necessary language to describe the causal structure behind observable phenomena, be they on an ontogenetic or phylogenetic biological timescale \citep{Mayr1961}.

Together, MES and CR enabled anthropologists to draw upon empirical findings and theoretical frameworks from neighbouring fields of cognitive science, psychology, evolutionary biology, and behavioural ecology, to develop hypotheses concerning causal mechanisms (psychological and cultural) and ultimate (evolutionary) explanations for human sociality \cite[e.g.][; see Appendix ~\ref{app1:intro} Section ~\ref{sect:modernSynthesis} for a more detailed explanation of MS, CR, and their applications to human behaviour]{Dawkins1976,Wilson1978,Sperber1996,Whitehouse2004,Dunbar1996}. However, the various start-up gambits and basic (linear) causal structure of initial models of cognition and evolution were (necessarily) limited the capacity of models to account for the full extent of humans' species-unique behavioural niche.  Approaches based on the MES either ignored the causal role of cognitive processes (for example, via the ``phenotypic gambit'' \citep{Grafen1984})
or else directed attention only to a small segment of cognitive mechanisms responsible for social decision making (in the case of game-theoretical models of cooperation, see \citep{Cosmides1992}) or for social learning (in the case of gene-culture coevolutionary models \citep{Henrich2007,Chudek2011}, which hinge on the cognitive capacities---e.g. imitation, teaching, and memory---for ``cumulative culture'' \citep{Tomasello1993}).  Although ever-evolving, one downside to these models is that their account of the full complexity of humans' behavioural repertoire is a gradual work in progress.

A second, and more fundamental challenge associated with these explanations is that they offer very little room for considering the causal determinacy of human cultural capacities on processes of evolution \citep{Laland2011}.  Instead, culture is either a proximate mechanism of the phenotype, or alternatively an evolutionary system in its own right \citep{Dawkins1976,Cavalli-Sforza1981}, distinct from the replication dynamics of genes.  In either account, the role of the visceral, affective dimensions of human cultural activities (including those that feature group exercise) are not promoted as significant.  The result is a rendering of human behaviour and human sociality that appears overly rigid, rule-based, and rational.

\myparagraph{Grooming at a distance}

As Anthropologists Robin Dunbar and Sussane Shultz have aptly pointed out, human sociality does not adhere to the ``dung fly'' but rather actively congregate in structured groups, and appear to have evolved capacities to achieve varying levels of congregation.


- For those species for whom sociality itself is part of the individual’s fitness strategy, being able to maintain the effective functionality of a group through time may have very significant implications for the individual fitnesses of its members.



- Bonding is not simply a cognitive process, even though cognition may be a necessary component; rather, bonded relationships appear to involve two parallel and quite distinct mechanisms—a cognitive mechanism (derivative of the social brain) and an emotionally based form of attachment (often involving a psycho-pharmacological mechanism) (Dunbar, 2010b).
- Bonding is a necessary prerequisite for individuals to build a more cognitively-based relationship, one that is akin to trust in the sense that individuals are willing to behave altruistically towards each other.

humans do not just aggregate together (based on ``if;then'' truth statements like dung beetles), we actively congregate together). In other words, there is a visceral dimension to our collective activity that makes our activity distinct.

psychopharmacologically-mediated emotional process:


Dunbar has pioneered the theory that this visceral dimension to human sociality can be explained by our evolved capacity for social bonding, which is thought to have arisen in primates an adaptive response to the pressures of group living.  Aggregating in groups serves to reduce threat from predation, but at the same time can be individually costly due to stress arising from interaction at close proximity, and conflict over resources among genetically unrelated individuals.  These costs can lead the group to disband, and are hypothesised to have led to selection for social bonding via dyadic grooming, as the coalitional alliances that arise among grooming partners allow for the maintenance of the group by buffering the stresses of group living (Dunbar, 2012).  Primate social grooming leads to the release of endorphins (a type of endogenous opioid), presumably leading to sustained rewarding and relaxing effects.  While other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, oxytocin and/or vasopressin may also be important in facilitating social interaction, it has been suggested that endorphins allow individuals who are not related or mating to interact with each other long enough to build “cognitive relationships of trust and obligation” (Dunbar, 2012, p. 1839).

As the homo genus evolved more complex collaborative capacities for survival in interdependent group contexts, grooming-like behavioural technologies also evolved to sustain social bonding in larger group sizes where dyadic grooming would take too much time (Dunbar, 2012).  Experimental studies suggest that neurophysiological mechanisms activated by activities that involve physical exertion and coordinated movement such as group laughter, dance and music making, exercise, and group ritual can bring groups closer together, mediated by the psychological effects of endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid release.  Endogenous opioids and endocannabinoids are neurotransmitters with analgesic, mood-elevating effects that have been implicated in mammalian social bonding. When these mood-elevating effects are experienced in a group they seem to lead to what Durkheim (1915/1965) described as collective effervescence, and, through embodying the each other’s affective experiences, result in more positive, trusting, and cooperative relationships among participants (Dunbar, 2012).

Social high theory:
The grooming hypothesis has made way for dedicated research of group exercise.


foster social cohesion \citep{Whitehouse2004}.  Social cohesion implies proximity, coordination, and stability of relationships between members of a group, which serve some benefit to the group as a whole.  In so far as more cohesive groups face better survival odds than those which are less so, activities that foster social cohesion can be considered collectively advantageous and adaptive \citep{Dunbar2010}.  It is not yet clear, however, precisely how or whether group exercise uniquely generates social cohesion, or in what ways particular mechanisms vary by activity and cultural context.

\subsubsection{The social high theory of group exercise and social bonding \label{sect:socialHigh}}

Recently, researchers interested in the cognitive and evolutionary significance of group exercise and related phenomena such as costly ritual behaviour have (perhaps unwittingly) made a scholarly ceremony out of invoking one particular passage from Durkheim (1965, pg. 217).  ``Once the individuals are gathered together,'' reads the beginning of the passage, ``a sort of electricity is generated from their closeness and quickly launches them to an extraordinary height of exaltation...'' \citep[see ][]{McNeill1995,Konvalinka2011,Fischer2014,Mogan2017}.  Much like Adrian's monologue, here Durkheim captures something of the mystery of group exercise contexts, albeit from an external viewpoint.  This passage lends itself neatly to empirical studies of the immediate causal mechanisms of the ``collective effervescence'' of group exercise.




Existing evidence focussed on proximate physiological, cognitive, and social mechanisms associated with group exercise suggests that group exercise is responsible for generating a psychophysiological environment conducive to social bonding.  Anthropologist Emma Cohen and colleagues have recently identified bi-directional causal links between the two essential ingredients of group exercise---1) physiological exertion and 2) interpersonal movement coordination---and their common psychophysiological effects, including increased pain tolerance, athletic performance, positive affect, wellbeing, pro-sociality, and cooperation \citep{Davis2015}.  This evidence amounts to what can be called the ``social high'' theory of group exercise and social bonding \citep[hereafter ``the social high theory,'' see][]{Cohen2017}. Here, social bonding is understood as the psychological experience of increased social closeness, which facilitates affiliation between non-kin group members \citep{Tarr2014}.  I outline the key principles of the social high theory below.

\myparagraph{Physiological exertion\label{sect:physExertion}}
Group exercise necessarily entails rigorous physiological exertion.
The health and wellbeing benefits associated with regular physical exercise---including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, autonomic dysfunction, and early mortality; as well as enhanced neurogenesis, cognitive ability, and mood---are becoming increasingly well-known \citep{Blair1994,Nagamatsu2014}. Evidence suggests that strenuous and prolonged physical exercise is modulated by the same neuropharmacological systems responsible for regulating pain, fatigue, and reward \citep{Boecker2008,Raichlen2013}.  Neurobiological rewards in exercise are associated with both central effects (improved affect, sense of well-being, anxiety reduction, post-exercise calm) and peripheral effects (analgesia), and appear to be dependent for their activation on exercise type, intensity, and duration \citep{Dietrich2004}.  Exercise-specific activity of neurobiological reward systems offers a plausible explanation for commonly reported sensations of positive affect, anxiety reduction, and improved subjective well-being during and following exercise---extremes of which are popularly referred to as the ``runner's high'' \citep{Dietrich2004,Boecker2008,Raichlen2012}.  This neurobiological evidence maps on to more extensive literature concerning the psychological effects of exercise, which indicates a duration and intensity ``sweet spot'' for exercise and positive affect, whereby moderate intensity exercise for durations of $\sim45$ minutes appears most optimal \citep{Reed2006}.

It is possible that the function of exercise-induced positive affect extends to the realm of social bonding, particularly when achieved in group exercise contexts \citep{Cohen2009,Machin2011}.  Endocannabinoids and opioids have been implicated in mammalian social bonding \citep{Fattore2010,Keverne1989}, and in humans specifically, there is evidence that endorphins (a particular class of endogenous opioids) mediate social bonding \citep{Dunbar2012,Shultz2010}.

\myparagraph{Interpersonal movement coordination}
Meanwhile, experimental evidence (predominantly from social psychology) suggests that time-locked coordination of behaviour between two or more individuals is conducive to psychological processes of self-other merging, liking, trust, and psychological affiliation.  In these contexts, interpersonal coordination is primarily operationalised as behavioural synchrony---i.e., stable time- and phase-locked movement of two or more independent components (limbs, bodies, fingers, etc.) \citep{Pikovsky2007}. Researchers suggest that synchrony enables a tight attentional union between individuals who match the timing and content of their actions, leading to the enhancement of interpersonal similarity and the blurring of self-other boundaries in cognitive processing and recall \citep{Cohen2017}.  Relative to non-synchronous group activities, synchrony increases social bonding and pro-social behaviour \citep{Reddish2013,Reddish2013a,Wiltermuth2009}---an evolutionarily important outcome of bonded relationships.  Recent studies have also found that, compared to solo and non-synchronous group exercise, synchronous group exercise leads to significantly greater post-workout pain threshold \citep{Cohen2009,Sullivan2014,Sullivan2013a, Sullivan2013b}.

A recent meta analysis of the behavioural synchrony literature in social psychology suggests three candidate mediators of the relationship between behavioural synchrony and social bonding: 1) lower cognitive affective mechanisms implicating neuropharmacological reward systems (e.g., opioidergic and dopaminergic systems), 2) neurocognitive action-perception networks responsible for the experience of self-other merging, and 3) processes of group-centred cognition responsible for perception and reinforcement of cooperation \citep{Mogan2017}.  The current balance of existing evidence suggests that affective physiological mechanisms may be more relevant to joint action involving larger group sizes in which generalised feelings of euphoria and pro-sociality are common \citep[e.g., mass religious rituals or music festivals, see][]{Weinstein2016}, whereas neurocognitive mechanisms linking joint action and social bonding may be more applicable to smaller group sizes in which individuals can share intentions through ostensive communicative signals and implicit movement regulation cues \citep{Lang2017}.  Studies linking synchrony with social bonding and cooperation are supported by a literature than connects nonconscious mimicry with liking and affiliation \citep{VanBaaren2009}.

\myparagraph{The social high $=$ exertion $\times$ synchrony}
In addition to recorded independent effects of exertion synchrony,  preliminary evidence suggests that exertion and coordination in group exercise interact to produce social effects \citep{Jackson2018}.  Social features of the exercise environment (for example, perceived social support, level and quality of behavioural synchrony, etc.) modulate exercise-induced mechanisms of pain and reward \citep{Cohen2009,Sullivan2014,Tarr2015,Davis2015,Weinstein2016}. This work is bolstered by existing literature on the social modulation of pain \citep{Eisenberger2012a} and links between pain and prosociality \citep{Bastian2014a}.  The social high theory thus combines these two bodies of literature to tell a story in which positive affect---associated with neuropharmacologically-mediated pain analgesia and reward—--is extended to the social group via synchrony-activated cognitive mechanisms of self-other merging, and the perception and reinforcement of in-group cooperation.


\section{Empirical knowledge gaps in the relationship between group exercise and social cohesion\label{sect:empKnowGaps}}
Even a cursory survey of human sociality reveals that group exercise scenarios often deviate markedly from the narrowly defined profile (the exertion $\times$ coordination sweet spot) and subjective experience of group exercise set out by the prevailing social high theory.  In this section, I review some of the empirical gaps that remain unexplained by the existing social high theory.  In particular, group exercise contexts often involve extreme (and not just moderate) levels of physiological exertion, as well as complex coordination demands (beyond exact synchrony).  In addition, the effects of participation in group exercise appear to extend well beyond those of feel-good social high, and into the realm of rich meaning making as well as fine-grained sensitivity to the click of joint action.


%In this dissertation I propose to develop cognitive and evolutionary understandings of group exercise through closer attention to the immediate causal processes and psycho-social effects of interpersonal movement.  I suggest that the carnal mystery that Adrian attempted to articulate on my first night in Beijing can be explained in part by the way in which extreme physiological exertion and interpersonal movement coordination combine in rugby to enable and constrain physiological, psychological, emotional, and social processes.

\myparagraph{Group exercise involves extreme cost and profound meaning\label{sect:linkCostMeaning}}
Anecdotal and observational evidence suggests that group exercise contexts often entail extreme levels of psychophysiological exertion.  High-stakes professional competitive sporting contexts (international-level sports such as rowing or ultra marathon running), extreme adventure sports (big wave surfing, free-diving), high-intensity contact (rugby union, American football, ice hockey) and combat sports (MMA, boxing, wrestling) are known to involve extreme physiological demands, often including high levels of pain.  Although it is expected that extremely physiologically costly exercise contexts will involve activation of neurobiological reward mechanisms outlined above (see Section~\ref{sect:sect:physExertion} in this Chapter, and Appendix~\ref{app1:intro} Section~\ref{sect:neuroRewardGE}), some contexts may on average exceed (or alternatively never reach) the intensity and duration sweet-spot for optimal activation of neurobiological reward \citep{Raichlen2013} or positive affect \citep{Ekkekakis2011,Reed2006}.

At the same time, physical exercise involving extreme physiological, psychological, and social costs also appear to offer participants and observers an opportunity for profound meaning.  Many people do not engage in exercise \textit{just} enjoyment or health; rather, in some contexts sport forms part of a life of purpose and self-discovery \citep[see, for example][]{Jackson1995,Jones2004,White2011}.  Modern sport has always been much more than ``just a game,'' and instead offers an arena in which virtues and vices are learned, and the ``morality plays''—--of community, nation, or globe—--thus performed \citep{Elias1986,McNamee2008}.  Psychological and physiological resilience in exercise contexts is lauded as virtuous, as is evidenced by the numerous idioms in the English language that receive currency in exercise lore: ``when the going gets tough, the tough get going,'' ``no pain, no gain,'' ``you get out what you put in'' and so on \citep{Sarkar2014}.

Whereas the social high theory predicts motivation for exercise based on ``hedonic'' enjoyment, anecdotal and ethnographic perspectives emphasise instead the ethical and moral dimensions of athletes' experiences, and contextualise these experiences within political processes relating to the construction of the self, community, and nation-state \citep{Alter1993,Brownell1995,Downey2005,Wacquant2004}.
Social anthropologists and sociologists have for some time emphasised the social function of exercise and sport in diverse cultural contexts, and various attempts have been made to analyse the phenomenological experience of exercise in terms of its sociological and psychological meaning \citep{Bourdieu1978}.

Social anthropologist Joseph Alter \textcite{Alter1993}, for example, argues that for wrestlers in north India, the body functions as a nexus through which the symbolic and material structures of the state, family, and the individual coalesce.  In a similar vein, in their seminal ethnography of sport in China, cultural anthropologist Susan Brownell \textcite{Brownell1995}, argues that sport functions as a crucial national symbolic practice for the Chinese nation-state in a project of ``rejoining the world,'' and that the ``micro-techniques'' (c.f. Foucault, 1977) of this project entail significant cost to (and rich meaning for) the individual athlete.   Similarly, French sociologist Loic Wacquant \textcite{Wacquant2004}, in an ethnography of boxers in Chicago's south side, describes a ``social logic'' of physical activity, claiming that the costs associated with ``the daily dedication and high technique that training demands; the regimented diet; the control, mutual respect, and tacit understandings necessary for actual fist-to-fist competition serve to create for the boxer an island of order and virtue'' \textcite[17]{Wacquant2004}. In many instances, it may be that the primary psychological motivation for exercise is not immediate, reward-induced hedonic wellbeing, but instead \textit{eudemonic} wellbeing, or the psychological awareness of a process through which life becomes ``well-lived'' \citep{Fave2009,Huta2013}.



\myparagraph{Group exercise involves complex coordination and team click\label{sect:linksComplexClick}}

Currently, the social high theory relies upon exact behavioural synchrony as an idealisation of successful coordination in joint action.  While some group exercise contexts do contain high levels of behavioural synchrony (rowing, synchronised swimming, diving, mass calisthenics, and forms of dance such as ballet), exact in-phase synchrony is not typical of most instances of group exercise.  More generally, interpersonal coordination is more often achieved through flexible, function-specific assemblages of complimentary and contrasting behaviours \citep[for example, coordination in an interactional team sport, a dyadic conversation, or an ensemble music performance, see][]{Fusaroli2014}.  Real world instances of joint action in group exercise usually entail various distinct action elements, organised hierarchically within a sequence \citep{Schmidt1975,Rosenbaum2009}.  Successful execution of the complex structure of real world joint action requires temporal and spatial precision and flexibility of movement across multiple timescales and sensorial modalities \citep{Sebanz2006}.

% As discussed below in Section ~\ref{sect:pathBeyondSynch}, this reliance on synchrony could occlude important causal mechanisms in a relationship between joint action and social bonding.

At the same time, participants in group exercise contexts involving complex joint action often scrutinise the quality of coordination.  For their success, technically demanding group exercise contexts such as competitive interactional team sports or music-making and dance, depend upon fine-grained precision of coordination of behaviours between individuals:  the movements and goals of one individual must align precisely in time and space with the movements and goals of another.  For highly skilled expert practitioners, who develop a fine-grained sensitivity concerning the perceived outcome of joint action, often the ecstasy of group activity is contingent not just on participation, or on strict synchrony or equivalence or similarity of behaviours, but on the extent to which joint action with co-participants ``clicks.''  Consider the passage below, taken from a series of interviews that psychologist Susan Jackson performed with elite figure skaters:
%Psychologist Susan Jackson has accumulated considerable evidence of elite level athletes' subjective experience of ``flow'' in joint action:
  \begin{quotation}
    It was just one of those programs that clicked. I mean everything went right, everything felt good . . . it's just such a rush, like you feel it could go on and on and on, like you don't want it to stop because it's going so well.  It's almost as though you don't have to think, it's like everything goes automatically without thinking . . . it's like you're in automatic pilot, so you don‘t have any thoughts.  You hear the music but you're not aware that you're hearing it, because it's a part of it all. \citep[168]{Jackson1992}.
  \end{quotation}

The psychological literature of flow and optimal human performance in sport has documented that athletes engaged in team coordination often report total absorption in and complete focus on the task at hand, a transformation of the experience of time (either speeding up or slowing down), and a blurring or transcendence of individual agency, or a ``loss of self''   \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992,Jackson1995,Jackson1999,McNeill1995}.  Research suggests that flow often occurs in scenarios in which there are clear goals inherent in the activity, as well as unambiguous feedback concerning extent to which goals are either being achieved or not.  In addition, scenarios most conducive to the experience of flow are those in which the technical requirements are challenging but achievable if practitioners are able to extend (slightly) beyond their normal capabilities\citep{Fong2015}.  The coalescence of these factors is intrinsically rewarding and autotelic\citep{Csikszentmihalyi1975}, activating both ``hedonic'' and ``eudemonic'' dimensions of subjective well-being \citep{Huta2010,Fave2009}.

Psychologists and neuroscientists have extensively studied the experience of flow, and have tabled a series of neuropharmacological \citep{Boecker2008}, neurocognitive \citep{Dietrich2006,Dietrich2011,Labelle2013}, and psychological \citep{Csikszentmihalyi1992} theories for its emergence.  The vast majority of flow research has focussed on the experience of the individual---the athlete, musician, or performer.  Some attempts have been made to extended an analysis of flow and its antecedents to the level of the group and dynamics of interpersonal coordination---a phenomenon termed ``group flow'' \citep{Sawyer2006}---but these attempts lack coherence and development.  Anecdote and observational evidence suggests that in addition to the components of flow already identified at the level of the individual, successful performance of technically complex joint action (beyond exact in-phase synchrony) could have distinct psychological and social consequences.




%In sum, clear variation in the types, intensities, and durations of group exercise, and the complex structure and subjective experience of, and motivation for group exercise presents an opportunity for further research into explanatory cognitive, evolutionary, and social mechanisms underlying these observable phenomena.

%In particular, I identify two relationships hitherto unaccounted for by existing accounts: the relationship between extreme cost and profound meaning, and the relationship between successful performance of complex joint action and perceptions of flow or ``team click.''






\section{Addressing empirical gaps through a focussed study of rugby in China}
How can we address these gaps in scientific understandings of group exercise?  Is it possible that these gaps are causally linked via mechanisms beyond those currently specified by the social high theory?
Based on the evidence reviewed above, it seems likely that, in addition to moderate intensity exertion, in-phase synchrony, and a feel good social high, an investigation into extreme levels of pain, the ``click'' of complex joint action, and profound psychological meaning making, could also offer important insights into a relationship between group exercise and social cohesion.  If so, what cognitive and evolutionary mechanisms are required to link the full diversity of profiles of group exercise with the full diversity of their psycho-social effects?

In this dissertation, I focus my research on a group exercise context well suited to address the empirical knowledge gaps outlined above.  Rugby union (hereafter ``rugby'') is a dynamic field-based contact sport that requires of its participants high levels of physiological exertion and complex coordination of joint action (see Chapter ~\ref{chap:researchSetting} Section ~\ref{sect:rugbyUnion} for a more detailed explanation). As I outline in more detail below, rugby is also anecdotally and colloquially associated with experiences of team click and social bonding in many of the contexts in which it is commonly played \citep{Dunning2005}.

``Rugby'' and ``China'' are two words that are not usually mentioned in the same sentence.  Rugby---''a game for barbarians played by gentlemen''---first took root in the elite education institutions of Britain's colonial empire.  China has enthusiastically adopted sport and exercise at different stages throughout the country's turbulent modern history. But for most of this history, rugby accorded neither with a dominant Olympic-centred logic of the Chinese sport system, nor with dominant cultural dispositions and modes of understandings physicality \citep[derived from Confucian and Daoist traditions of thought, see][]{Morris2004}.  Rugby eventually made it to China in 1990, as a university sport program set up through an exchange with a Japanese university.  However, since 2009, when rugby became an Olympic sport in the form of ``rugby sevens'' (the modified seven-a-side version of rugby), rugby has been ``embosomed'' (\textit{huaibao} 怀抱) by the state-sponsored sport system \citep{Xu2010}.  At the time of writing, more than ten of China's 32 provinces have full time men's and women's professional programs.

While rugby has an institutional footprint in China, Chinese adherents to the sport face various challenges in the process of acquiring rugby's technical and social skills.  Rugby in China contains fewer of the cultural scaffolds that are erected around the sport in traditional rugby playing nations: young children do not grow up playing rugby in the schoolyard or watching their heroes and heroines play rugby on television. Beyond rugby, China has traditionally struggled to perform well world (and regional) stage in interactional team sports like association football.  A number of social, economic, and cultural factors are at play in the phenomenon of China's poor performance in team sport.  Suffice to say, however, the construct of an abstract and arbitrary egalitarian social assembly, well-known in Western cultures as ``team,'' is not an indigenous psychological concept in China \cite{Liu2009}.  As I discuss in greater detail in the ethnographic study of this dissertation (Chapters ~\ref{chap:ethnoField}\nobreakdash~\ref{chap:ethnoResults}), the technical and social requirements of rugby appear to chafe against more predominant cognitive, social, and institutional concerns structured by the cultural terrain in modern China.

In spite of the lack of snug fit between rugby and dominant modes of social cognition in contemporary China, rugby is evidently responsible for generating a mysterious ``carnal'' feeling in its participants, as Adrian's monologue and my ethnographic observations professional rugby players in China confirm (see Chapters~\ref{chap:ethnoField} and~\ref{chap:ethnoResults}).  Rugby in China thus not only presents an excellent opportunity to explore the role of cultural variation in shaping patterns of behaviour in group exercise.  In addition, rugby in China presents an opportunity to subject an inherently ``WEIRD'' \citep[Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic; cf.][]{Henrich2010d} suite of cognitive and evolutionary theories to a non-WEIRD empirical setting.  As I explain in more detail in Chapter ~\ref{chap:researchSetting}, my qualifications uniquely position me to conduct research into rugby in China.

In sum, researching rugby in China offers an opportunity to address many of the outstanding theoretical and empirical questions in scientific explanations of group exercise.  The core contribution of this dissertation is to develop and test a theory of joint action and social bonding in group exercise that extends beyond behavioural synchrony.


\subsection{A pathway between joint action and social bonding, beyond exact synchrony \label{sect:pathBeyondSynch}}

From a cognitive perspective, establishing and sustaining successful joint action is a daunting computational task.  As Bernstein \textcite{Bernstein1967} first pointed out, just as any intra-personal gross motor movement requires a flexible yet precise assembly and coordination of thousands of muscles and hundreds of joints, so too does interpersonal movement require the coordination of the ``degrees of freedom'' (df) of co-actors and the features of the physical environment \citep{Riley2011}.  Unlike intra-personal movement, however, the df of an interpersonal movement system are highly unconstrained and autonomous (i.e., prone to their own self-directed movements, intentions, dispositions, and beliefs).  Thus, no matter how fluid and effortless interpersonal coordination can be made to look during expert performances of music, dance, and sport, or even in simple face-to-face conversations between friends, without privileged access to high fidelity information about the intentions and actions of co-actors, joint action is destined to be marred by the experience of extreme levels of informational uncertainty \citep{Sebanz2009,Fusaroli2014}.

Despite the cognitive improbability of joint action, humans have managed---stoically, and at times somewhat elegantly---to devise a number of effective solutions to joint action throughout their evolutionary trajectory.  To be sure, the prevalence of behavioural synchrony in human cultural practices can be understood as one such elegant solution to the challenge of achieving and sustaining interpersonal coordination \citep{McNeill1995}.  Synchronisation is defined as a process in which two independent components continuously influence each other toward greater entrainment (within a certain lag tolerance) such that synchronising parties reduce overall variance of their joint activity, making them more similar and more regular \citep{Pikovsky2007}.  The simplicity of synchrony's repetitive action sequences and the fact that synchrony is often involves the assistance of an external perceptual referent (like a beat), enables tight coupling of the component df of a multi agent movement system.  Synchrony is immediately eye catching and symmetrical for its observers, and technically simple, efficient, and evidently rewarding  for its performers \citep{Mogan2017}.  Synchrony is thus easily scalable to the coordination of behaviour in large groups, and this this may explain its cross-cultural ubiquity in human cultural practices \citep{Dunbar2010,Tarr2016}.

In the current formulation of the social high theory, exact in-phase synchrony functions as an essentialisation of successful interpersonal coordination in group exercise.  However, it is important not to become overly fixated on behavioural synchrony as an ideal expression of coordination in group exercise contexts \citep{Keller2014}.  Using strict synchrony as a stand-in for successful coordination in joint action threatens to occlude important processes of interpersonal coordination, which may be relevant to the phenomenon of team click and flow-on processes of social bonding.  What's more, a fixation on synchrony alone can lead to the misleading prediction that optimal coordination in joint action should resemble progress toward similarity and equivalence of action between co-actors \citep{Fusaroli2014}.

A focus on synchrony offers an opportunity to investigate how the brain anticipates \textit{when} an event will occur—--but not necessarily \textit{what} event it will be \citep{Novembre2014}. By contrast, real world joint action scenarios are often spatiotemporal rather than purely temporal phenomena \citep{Phillips-Silver2012}, requiring both precision and flexibility of interpersonal movement regulation across multiple sensorial modalities \citep{Keller2014}. Predicting the structure and sequence of actions from an infinite number of possibilities calls for additional cognitive resources, such as stronger use of cortical motor areas for action simulation and representation \citep{Bekkering2009} or lower cognitive mechanisms of movement regulation that support the emergence of functional interpersonal synergies \citep{Riley2011}.

\subsubsection{Theoretical challenges association with explaining team click and social bonding in joint action}

Real-word instances of group exercise are complex and multidimensional behavioural phenomena involving dynamic interaction of multiple brains and bodies, situated in varied and richly resourced cultural ecologies.  Development of cognitive and evolutionary theories that can account for this complexity, and in so doing reconcile some of the identifiable gaps in existing accounts, remains a work in progress \citep{Fuentes2016}.

Researchers have pointed out that flow has traditionally escaped rigorous scientific analysis \citep{Dietrich2010a,Slingerland2014}. Dietrich, for example, explains that flow presents a paradox that is difficult to explain according to traditional theories of attention and mental effort, which tend to assume better performance, on any task, is associated with increased conscious effort allocated to that task \citep{Dietrich2004b}.  Flow appears to entail spectrum of both effortful and seemingly effortless cognitions implicating embodied action and the resources of the bio-external environment.  Team click, too, is a multidimensional process involving mental, embodied, emotional, and social dimensions.  Equipped with only rudimentary explanatory tools from a youthful science of the human mind (cognitive science), it is understandable that scientific progress on the topic has been gradual.

A long-standing movement within the cognitive and behavioural sciences has called for a greater recognition of the physical and dynamical properties of information transfer in biological systems.  Proponents of so-called embodied, embedded, enactive or extended cognition \citep[now collectively referred to as ``4E cognition,'' see][]{Menary2010}, emphasise that cognition typically involves acting with a physical body on an environment in which that body is immersed. Researchers in this movement call out traditional models of human cognition for being too static, abstract, and compartmentalised: human behaviour is traditionally rendered as the outcome of a linear chain of perception, a-modal representation, and action-selection, located discretely either within the brain or else within certain (often dualistic) subsystems of the brain ( \citep[e.g., emotional and cognitive, System 1 (fast) and System 2 (slow), implicit and explicit, and so on; cf.][]{Diennes1999,Kahneman2011}.

The core of the 4E argument can be boiled down to the idea that just as humans physically move, so too does the information that supports human movement (cognition).  Human inferential processes not only activate physical movement, but are also activated by movement, in a dynamical loop of reciprocal causation.  While proponents of the 4E approach have made valuable contributions to a definition of what traditional theories of human cognition are \textit{not}, empirical evidence capable of adjudicating between testable hypotheses has lagged behind high-volume and high-postured debate.  Interestingly, the debate over the nature of cognition shares many properties with a similar debate over the nature of evolutionary change \citep{Nowak2010,Scott-Phillips2011,Laland2014,Fuentes2016}.

\subsection{An ``active'' theoretical solution}
Fortunately for all involved, a paradigm shift in cognitive and behavioural sciences is shedding new light on human solutions to the challenge of joint action.  Recent advances in neuroimaging technologies \citep{Frith2007}, neurocomputational theories of brain function \citep{Friston2010,Frith2010,Yufik2013,Clark2013}, and constructive attempts to extend the theoretical paradigm of human social cognition to account for inter-individual processes of interaction and coordination \citep{Sebanz2006,Dale2014}, have resulted in a theoretical paradigm, in which it is now more clearly understood that cognitive processes relevant to joint action are distributed throughout brains, bodies, and the physical environment of the ecological niche in which they are situated.  As I explain below and in detail in Chapter ~\ref{chap:theory}, this shift in understanding of human cognition allows for a more powerful and fine-grained explanatory model of how joint action---and, in turn, social connection---could achieved between two or more participants.

The prevailing paradigm, which I consider in this dissertation, conceives of human cognition as a process of ``active inference'' \citep{Friston2010}.  Active inference \citep[and the predictive coding paradigm which it extends, see][]{Clark2013} proposes a radical inverse of traditional models of cognition that rely predominantly on bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down feature detection \citep{Marr1985}. Instead, active inference posits that top-down predictive models themselves shape perception and action, and the only information that travels forward (or from the ``bottom-up'') is the error signals that arise from discrepancies between predictions and the sensorium \citep{Clark2015}.  The active inference approach  depicts a human cognitive system in which perception, mental simulation, emotion, and action are functionally and temporally integrated to manage uncertainty inherent in interactions with the environment \citep{Clark2013}.

Rather than being restricted to a dualistic either/or choice between functionally distinct cognitive modes of inference (e.g. habitual or mental, explicit or implicit, fast and slow \citep[cf.][]{Dienes1999,Kahneman2011}, active inference predicts that humans benefit from flexible deployment of of multiple strategies from a unified web of neural and extra-neural affordances \citep{Pezzulo2013,Clark2015}.  These strategies can be seen to like on a continuum, which ranges from more computationally intensive interoceptive (internal or mental) predictive models, on one end, to lower cognitive mechanisms of movement regulation that facilitate more direct coupling with the extra-neural resources of the task-specific environment, on the other \citep{Riley2011}.

While successful joint action may require flexible deployment of a strategies along the full continuum, certain strategies may be more personally and socially rewarding than others.  It is possible that team click represents a situation in which the personal and social rewards of coordination in joint action are maximised. As I explain in more detail in Chpater ~\ref{chap:theory}, of the available alternatives \citep[see, for example,][]{Keller2016}, active inference offers the most suitable theoretical model to account for the social cognition of complex real world joint action contexts \citep{Friston2015,Pesquita2017}.

As explained above, the social bonding effects of group exercise may in some circumstances be contingent not merely upon whether an athlete achieves a certain sweet spot of exertion or sustains in-phase behavioural synchrony.  In addition to these factors outlined by the social high theory, the electricity of group exercise could be crucially contingent on the extent to which athletes feel the ``click'' of joint action.  The proximate cognitive mechanisms of team click currently lie outside the bounds of the social high theory.  In this dissertation I address this discrepancy.


\section{The present study\label{sect:presentStudy}}
To summarise the ground covered thus far: this thesis is driven by the research question of explaining the puzzling ubiquity of group exercise in the (more recent) human record. Current cognitive and evolutionary accounts suggest a relationship between group exercise and social cohesion, due in part to the way in which group exercise contexts uniquely generate social bonding between participants.  The social high theory posits that social bonding in group exercise is due to the way in which physiological exertion and interpersonal movement coordination combine to generate a psychophysiological environment conducive to affiliation and trust (social bonding).  The social high theory currently fails to account for various empirical knowledge gaps in the relationship between group exercise and social bonding.  In this dissertation I focus on the theoretical pathway between successful performance of complex joint action and feelings of team click.  I propose the phenomenon of ``team click'' as a candidate construct that can help explain a hitherto under-examined link between joint action and social bonding.


\subsection{Components of the present study\label{sect:components}}

\input{images/contributionsTable}

In this section, I outline the components of this thesis, namely, the novel theory of social bonding through joint action, and the three empirical studies I performed to substantiate this theory (see Table ~\ref{tab:contributions}).


\subsubsection{A novel theory of joint action through social bonding}

  The overarching prediction of this thesis is that the psychological phenomenon of team click mediates a relationship between joint action and social bonding.  In Chapter ~\ref{chap:theory} I develop a novel theory of social bonding through joint action, in which I propose team click as a psychological construct capable of explaining maximal bonding effects of joint action.  This theory relies on a number of sub-hypotheses, summarised below:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Athletes who perceive greater success in joint action will experience higher levels of felt ``team click.'' I predict that relevant perceptions of joint action success will relate to athlete perceptions of:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item a combination of specific technical components; or
          \item an overall perception of team performance relative to prior expectations; or
          \item an interaction between these two dimensions of team performance.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Athletes who experience higher levels of team click will report higher levels of social bonding.
      \item More positive perceptions of joint action success will predict higher levels of social bonding, driven by more positive:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item perceptions of components of team performance;; or
        \item violation of team performance expectations; or
        \item an interaction between these two predictors.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

In honour of the capacity of cultural environments to enable and constrain certain patterns of joint action (explained in detail in Chapters ~\ref{chap:theory} and ~\ref{chap:researchSetting}), I conducted focussed research with one population subjects: professional rugby players in China.  The emprical studies outlined below progress in a step-wise fasion, from ethnographic participatn observation, to an \textit{in situ} survey study, to a controlled field experiment.

\subsubsection{Ethnography of the Beijing men's rugby team}
  The first study consists of extended ethnographic research with one Chinese professional rugby team, the Beijing Provincial men's rugby team (see Chapters ~\ref{4partAIntroMethod}\nobreakdash~\ref{6ethnographicResults}).  Data were collected during three trips to Beijing over an 18 month period.

\subsubsection{\textit{In situ} survey study of a Chinese National
 Rugby Tournament}
  Following the initial ethnographic starting point, I then broadened the scope of analysis to include all available Chinese professional provincial rugby players. Participants for the second study ($n = 174, men = 93$) were athletes in a Chinese national tournament, in which fifteen different teams from nine different provinces competed over two days for the 2016 Championship (Chapter ~\ref{5ethnographicField}).  The tournament offered the opportunity to investigate hypotheses concerning the relationship between joint action, team click, and social bonding \textit{in situ}, in a real-world instance of high intensity, high stakes joint action.

\subsubsection{Controlled field experiment}
  Subsequently, in order to more definitively assesses the causal mechanisms identified in the predictions of this dissertation, I conducted a controlled field experiment ($n = 58, male = 29$). In a between-subjects design, I manipulated the level of predicted difficulty prior to athletes participating in ostensibly different (but in fact identical) training drills.

%\subsection{Contributions}



\section{Overview of chapters\label{sect:chapters}}
In this introductory chapter, I outline the overarching research question of this dissertation, which is a scientific explanation for the ubiquity of group exercise in human sociality.  I explain that, while the social high theory of group exercise and social bonding has shed light on important causal mechanisms involved in many group exercise contexts, it contains obvious knowledge gaps, owing in part to a bifurcation in scientific approaches to sport and exercise.  I hone in on team click as an observable phenomenon in group exercise worthy of further theorisation and empirical investigation, due to the way in which it appears to involve a relationship between interpersonal movement coordination and social bonding.  I identify the social cognition of joint action as a field of research in which novel theoretical predictions regarding the relationship between group exercise and social bonding can be formulated.  I preview this theoretical formulation and outline this dissertation's three main empirical studies and their knowledge contribution to cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of group exercise.  In the following chapter, I outline in detail a novel theory of social bonding through joint action, in particular the mediating role of the phenomenon of team click.
