  In this chapter I outline a novel theory of social bonding through joint action, which will be tested in subsequent empirical studies of joint action among Chinese rugby players.  In the previous Chapter, I reviewed theoretical and empirical evidence for a causal link between joint action and social bonding.  In particular, I suggested that the psychological construct of team click offers an explanation for this link. In this chapter I present a novel theory of social bonding through joint action, outline predictions of the theory, and justify the relevance of this novel theory for joint action scenarios typical of group exercise.
