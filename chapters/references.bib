abstract = {What kinds of processes and representations make joint action possible? In this paper, we suggest a minimal architecture for joint action that focuses on representations, action monitoring and action prediction processes, as well as ways of simplifying coordination. The architecture spells out minimal requirements for an individual agent to engage in a joint action. We discuss existing evidence in support of the architecture as well as open questions that remain to be empirically addressed. In addition, we suggest possible interfaces between the minimal architecture and other approaches to joint action. The minimal architecture has implications for theorising about the emergence of joint action, for human-machine interaction, and for understanding how coordination can be facilitated by exploiting relations between multiple agents' actions and between actions and the environment. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {When two adults jointly perform a task, they often show interference effects whereby the other's task interferes with their own performance (Sebanz, Knoblich, {\&} Prinz, 2003). The current study investigated whether these co-representation effects can be observed in young children. This phenomenon can be used as a criterion for adult-like joint action in children, which has been under debate in existing literature due to the difficulty in identifying what mechanisms underlie the behaviours observed (Brownell, 2011). In Experiment 1, two children performed an adapted Bear Dragon task (Kochanska, Murray, Jacques, Koenig, {\&} Vandegeest, 1996), where children were required to point to a picture when instructed to do so by one puppet and to inhibit pointing when instructed to by the other. In the Same Task condition, both children in a pair were asked to respond to the same puppet, whereas in the Different Task condition, they were asked to respond to different puppets. Children made more errors in the Different Task condition than the Same Task, suggesting that they were experiencing interference from their partner's task rule. In Experiment 2 children in Different and Same task conditions began with the same task as in Experiment 1 and then switched which puppet to respond to. Switch costs were lower in the Different task condition, consistent with children having already represented the alternative task rule on behalf of their partner during the pre-switch phase. Experiment 3 replicated the effect of Task in a novel computer-based paradigm with children between 4 and 5. years, but not younger. These data provide the first direct evidence that children as young as 4. years co-represent a partner's task during a joint activity, and that younger children may not be capable of co-representation. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Participants responded to target letters (Experiment 1) or colors (Experiment 2) surrounded by distractors. When performing their part of the task next to another person performing the complementary part of the task, participants responded more slowly to stimuli containing flankers that were potential targets for their co-actor (incompatible trials), compared to stimuli containing identical, compatible, or neutral flankers. This joint Flanker effect also occurred when participants merely believed to be performing the task with a co-actor (Experiment 3). Furthermore, Experiment 4 demonstrated that people form shared task representations only when they perceive their co-actor as intentionally controlling her actions. These findings substantiate and generalize earlier results on shared task representations and advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms subserving joint action.},

abstract = {Humans have developed a number of specific mechanisms that allow us to maintain much larger social networks than would be expected given our brain size. For our primate cousins, social bonding is primarily sup-ported using grooming, and the bonding effect this produces is primarily mechanistically underpinned by the release of endorphins (although other neurohormones are also likely to be involved). Given large group sizes and time budgeting constraints, grooming is not viable as the primary social bonding mechanism in humans. Instead, during our evolutionary history, we developed other behaviours that helped us to feel connected to our social communities. Here, we propose that synchrony might act as direct means to encourage group cohesion by causing the release of neu-rohormones that influence social bonding. By acting on ancient neuro-chemical bonding mechanisms, synchrony can act as a primal and direct social bonding agent, and this might explain its recurrence throughout diverse human cultures and contexts (e.g. dance, prayer, marching, music-making). Recent evidence supports the theory that endorphins are released during synchronised human activities, including sport, but partic-ularly during musical interaction. Thus, synchrony-based activities are likely to have developed due to the fact that they allow the release of these hormones in large-scale human communities, providing an alterna-tive to social bonding mechanisms such as grooming.},

abstract = {Group dynamics play an important role in the social interactions of both children and adults. A large amount of research has shown that merely being allocated to arbitrarily defined groups can evoke disproportionately positive attitudes toward one's in-group and negative attitudes toward out-groups, and that these biases emerge in early childhood. This prompts important empirical questions with far-reaching theoretical and applied significance. How robust are these inter-group biases? Can biases be mitigated by behaviors known to bond individuals and groups together? How can bonds be forged across existing group divides? To explore these questions, we examined the bonding effects of interpersonal synchrony on minimally constructed groups in a controlled experiment. In-group and out-group bonding were assessed using questionnaires administered before and after a task in which groups performed movements either synchronously or non-synchronously in a between-participants design. We also developed an implicit behavioral measure, the Island Game, in which physical proximity was used as an indirect measure of interpersonal closeness. Self-report and behavioral measures showed increased bonding between groups after synchronous movement. Bonding with the out-group was significantly higher in the condition in which movements were performed synchronously than when movements were performed non-synchronously between groups. The findings are discussed in terms of their importance for the developmental social psychology of group dynamics as well as their implications for applied intervention programs.},

This study uses an experimental paradigm to determine which aspects of synchrony in dance are associated with changes in pain threshold (a proxy for endorphin release) and social bonding between strangers. Those who danced in synchrony experienced elevated pain thresholds, whereas those in the partial and asynchrony conditions experienced no analgesic effects. Similarly, those in the synchrony condition reported being more socially bonded, although they did not perform more cooperatively in an economic game. This experiment suggests that dance encourages social bonding among co-actors by stimulating the production of endorphins, but may not make people more altruistic. We conclude that dance may have been an important human behavior evolved to encourage social closeness between strangers.},

Three nested subtypes of populational models can be distinguished: evolutionary, selectional and replicative. Substantial progress has been made in the study of cultural evolution by modelling it within the selectional frame. This progress has involved idealizing away from phenomena that may be critical to an adequate understanding of culture and cultural evolution, particularly the constructive aspect of the mechanisms of cultural transmission. Taking these aspects into account, we describe cultural evolution in terms of cultural attraction, which is populational and evolutionary, but only selectional under certain circumstances. As such, in order to model cultural evolution, we must not simply adjust existing replicative or selectional models but we should rather generalize them, so that, just as replicator-based selection is one form that Darwinian selection can take, selection itself is one of several different forms that attraction can take. We present an elementary formalization of the idea of cultural attraction.},

The latter is associated with the notion of ‘‘cultural attraction''. This issue has generated much misunderstanding and confusion. We first clarify the respective positions, noting that there is in fact no substantive incompatibility between cultural attraction and standard cultural evolution ap- proaches, beyond a difference in focus. Whether cultural transmission should be considered a preservative or reconstructive process is ultimately an empirical question, and we examine how both preservative and reconstructive cultural transmission has been studied in recent experimental research in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss how the relative importance of preservative and reconstructive processes may depend on the granularity of analysis and the domain being studied.},

abstract = {A variety of joint action studies show that people tend to fall into synchronous behavior with others participating in the same task, and that such synchronization is beneficial, leading to greater rapport, satisfaction, and performance. It has been noted that many of these task environments require simple interactions that involve little planning of action coordination toward a shared goal. The present study utilized a complex joint construction task in which dyads were instructed to build model cars while their hand movements and heart rates were measured. Participants built these models under varying conditions, delimiting how freely they could divide labor during a build session. While hand movement synchrony was sensi-tive to the different tasks and outcomes, the heart rate measure did not show any effects of interpersonal synchrony. Results for hand movements show that the more participants were constrained by a particular building strategy, the greater their behavioral synchrony. Within the different conditions, the degree of synchrony was predictive of subjective satisfaction and objective product outcomes. However, in contrast to many previous findings, synchrony was negatively associated with superior products, and, depending on the constraints on the interaction, positively or negatively correlated with higher subjective satisfaction. These results show that the task context critically shapes the role of synchronization during joint action, and that in more complex tasks, not synchronization of behavior, but rather comple-mentary types of behavior may be associated with superior task outcomes.},

This paper reviews the cognitive perspective's common coding/mirror neuron theory of joint action, describes some of its limitations and then presents the behavioral dynamics perspective as an alternative way of understanding social motor coordination. In particular, behavioral dynamics' ability to explain the temporal coordination of interacting individuals is detailed. Two experiments are then described that demonstrate how dynamical processes of synchronization are apparent in the coordination underlying everyday joint actions such as martial art exercises, hand-clapping games, and conversations. The import of this evidence is that emergent dynamic patterns such as synchronization are the behavioral order that any neural substrate supporting joint action (e.g., mirror systems) would have to sustain. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We hypothesized that, under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony-a well-described phenomenon in biological and physical settings-could emerge spontaneously between humans as a result of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonal interactions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairs of participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions, while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed by someone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase and frequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developed and used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as they exchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed to coordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degree to which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the social encounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.},

Modeling arm movements in an Aikido technique as coupled oscillators, we investigated whether more-skilled participants would adapt to the perturbation of weighted arms in different and predictable ways compared to less-skilled participants. Thirty-four participants ranging from complete novice to veterans of more than twenty years were asked to perform an Aikido exercise with a repeated attack and response, resulting in a period of steady-state coordination, followed by a take down. We used mean relative phase and its variability to measure the steady-state dynamics of both the inter- and intrapersonal coordination. Our findings suggest that interpersonal coordination of less-skilled participants is disrupted in highly predictable ways based on oscillatory dynamics; however, more-skilled participants overcome these natural dynamics to maintain critical performance variables. Interestingly, the more-skilled participants exhibited more variability in their intrapersonal dynamics while meeting these interpersonal demands. This work lends insight to the development of skill in competitive social motor activities.},

abstract = {Under healthy conditions, the normal cardiac (sinus) interbeat interval fluctuates in a complex manner. Quantitative analysis using techniques adapted from statistical physics reveals the presence of long-range power-law correlations extending over thousands of heartbeats. This scale-invariant (fractal) behavior suggests that the regulatory system generating these fluctuations is operating far from equilibrium. In contrast, it is found that for subjects at high risk of sudden death (e.g., congestive heart failure patients), these long-range correlations break down. Application of fractal scaling analysis and related techniques provides new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as motivating development of novel physiologic models of systems that appear to be heterodynamic rather than homeostatic.},

abstract = {We describe a " centipede's dilemma" that faces the sciences of human interaction. Research on human interaction has been involved in extensive theoretical debate, although the vast majority of research tends to focus on a small set of human behaviors, cognitive processes, and interactive contexts. The problem is that naturalistic human interaction must integrate all of these factors simultaneously, and grander theoretical mitigation cannot come only from focused experimental or computational agendas. We look to dynamical systems theory as a framework for thinking about how these multiple behaviors, processes, and contexts can be integrated into a broader account of human interaction. By introducing and utilizing basic concepts of self-organization and synergy, we review empirical work that shows how human interaction is flexible and adaptive and structures itself incrementally during unfolding interactive tasks, such as conversation, or more focused goal-based contexts. We end on acknowledging that dynamical systems accounts are very short on concrete models, and we briefly describe ways that theoretical frameworks could be integrated, rather than endlessly disputed, to achieve some success on the centipede's dilemma of human interaction. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This 'predictive processing' frame-work shows great promise as a means of both understanding and integrating the core information processing strategies underlying perception, reasoning, and action. But how, if at all, do emotions and sub-cortical contributions fit into this emerging picture? The fit, we shall argue, is both profound and potentially transformative. In the pic-ture we develop, online cognitive function cannot be assigned to either the cortical or the sub-cortical component, but instead emerges from their tight co-ordination. This tight co-ordination involves processes of continuous reciprocal causation that weave together bodily information and 'top-down' predictions, generating a unified sense of what's out there and why it matters. The upshot is a more truly 'embodied' vision of the predictive brain in action.},

abstract = {Intuition suggests that perception follows sensation and therefore bodily feelings originate in the body. However, recent evidence goes against this logic: interoceptive experience may largely reflect limbic predictions about the expected state of the body that are constrained by ascending visceral sensations. In this Opinion article, we introduce the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, which integrates an anatomical model of corticocortical connections with Bayesian active inference principles, to propose that agranular visceromotor cortices contribute to interoception by issuing interoceptive predictions. We then discuss how disruptions in interoceptive predictions could function as a common vulnerability for mental and physical illness. For many decades, neuroscientists understood the brain as a 'stimulus–response' organ, consisting of individual neurons that lie dormant until stimulated. In this traditional model, learning and experience merely modulate neural activity that is driven by sensory events in the world. In recent years, scientists have come to realize that the brain probably does not work this way. Instead, research and theory are converging on the idea of the brain as an active inference generator that functions according to a Bayesian approach to probability: sensory inputs constrain estimates of prior probability (from past experience) to create the posterior probabilities that serve as beliefs about the causes of such inputs in the present 1,2 .},

abstract = {Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this "hierarchical prediction machine" approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

abstract = {On a traditional view of cognition, we see the agent acquiring stimuli, interpreting these in some way, and producing behavior in response. An increasingly popular alternative is the predictive processing framework. This sees the agent as continually generating predictions about the world, and responding productively to any errors made. Partly because of its heritage in the Bayesian brain theory, predictive processing has generally been seen as an inherently Bayesian process. The ‘hierarchical prediction machine' which mediates it is envisaged to be a specifically Bayesian device. But as this paper shows, a specification for this machine can also be derived directly from information theory, using the metric of predictive payoff as an organizing concept. Hierarchical prediction machines can be built along purely information-theoretic lines, without referencing Bayesian theory in any way; this simplifies the account to some degree. The present paper describes what is involved and presents a series of working models. An experiment involving the conversion of a Braitenberg vehicle to use a controller of this type is also described.},

Specific roles for the various components of the social brain are beginning to emerge. For example, the amygdala attaches emotional value to faces, enabling us to recognize expressions such as fear and trustworthiness, while the posterior superior temporal sulcus predicts the end point of the complex trajectories created when agents act upon the world. It has proved more difficult to assign a role to medial prefrontal cortex, which is consistently activated when people think about mental states. I suggest that this region may have a special role in the second-order representations needed for communicative acts when we have to represent someone else's representation of our own mental state. These cognitive processes are not specifically social, since they can be applied in other domains. However, these cognitive processes have been driven to ever higher levels of sophistication by the complexities of social interaction.},

Using single-level data, we demonstrate an application of structural equation modeling (SEM) in estimating mediation models with multiple mediators and multiple outcomes. We also describe the estimation and interpretation of a 2→1→1 multilevel mediation model in which the first, second, and third numbers correspond to the measurement levels of the independent, mediator, and outcome variables, respectively. We present two numerical examples that use simulated data based on published studies in adolescence research to demonstrate how to specify, estimate, and interpret the results of single-level and multilevel mediation analyses to answer key research questions. We briefly discuss underlying assumptions required to make a valid causal interpretation of a mediation analysis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This long-awaited revision reflects extensive updates throughout, especially in the areas of Data Screening (Chapter 4), Multiple Regression (Chapter 5), and Logistic Regression (Chapter 12). A brand new chapter (Chapter 15) on Multilevel Linear Modeling explains techniques for dealing with hierarchical data sets. Also included are syntax and output for accomplishing many analyses through the most recent releases of SAS and SPSS. As in past editions, each technique chapter (1) discusses tests for assumptions of analysis (and procedures for dealing with their violation), (2) presents a small example, hand-worked for the most basic analysis, (3) describes varieties of analysis, (4) discusses important issues (such as effect size), and (5) provides an example with a real data set from tests of assumptions to write-up of a results section.

abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, ???model,??? ???type,??? and ???definition??? selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

abstract = {1.Researchers frequently take repeated measurements of individuals in a sample with the goal of quantifying the proportion of the total variation that can be attributed to variation among individuals vs. variation among measurements within individuals. The proportion of the variation attributed to variation among individuals is known as repeatability and is most frequently estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The goal of our study is to provide guidelines for determining the sample size (number of individuals and number of measurements per individual) required to accurately estimate the ICC.  2.We report a range of ICCs from the literature and estimate 95{\%} confidence intervals for these estimates. We introduce a predictive equation derived by Bonett (2002), and we test the assumptions of this equation through simulation. Finally, we create an R statistical package for the planning of experiments and estimation of ICCs.  3.Repeatability estimates were reported in 1{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} of the articles published in the journals surveyed. Repeatabilities tended to be highest when the ICC was used to estimate measurement error and lowest when it was used to estimate repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Few authors report confidence intervals, but our estimated 95{\%} confidence intervals for published ICCs generally indicated a low level of precision associated with these estimates. This survey demonstrates the need for a protocol to estimate repeatability.  4.Analysis of the predictions from Bonett's equation over a range of sample sizes, expected repeatabilities and desired confidence interval widths yields both analytical and intuitive guidelines for designing experiments to estimate repeatability. However, we find a tendency for the confidence interval to be underestimated by the equation when ICCs are high and overestimated when ICCs and the number of measurements per individual are low.  5.The sample size to use when estimating repeatability is a question pitting investigator effort against expected precision of the estimate. We offer guidelines that apply over a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary studies estimating repeatability, measurement error or heritability. Additionally, we provide the R package, icc, to facilitate analyses and determine the most economic use of resources when planning experiments to estimate repeatability.},

In our pet-food example, if there is a true effect of recipe—that is, if on average a new, previously unstudied cat will on average eat more of recipe 2 than of recipe 1—it should be detectable above and beyond the noise introduced by cat-specific recipe preferences, provided we have enough data.

Technically speaking, the fixed effect is tested against an error term that captures the variability of the effect across individuals.

Ultimately, the random effect structure one uses in an analysis encodes the assumptions that one makes about how sampling units (subjects and items) vary, and the structure of dependency that this variation creates in one's data.

For designs including within-subjects (or within-items) manipulations, random- intercepts-only LMEMs can have catastrophically high Type I error rates, regardless of how p-values are computed from them (see also Roland, 2009; Jaeger, 2011a; and Schielzeth {\&} Forstmeier, 2009);

annote = {The classical sandwich conception of the mind –
widespread across philosophy and empirical sciences of the mind – regards perception as input from world to mind, action as output from mind to world, and cognition as sandwiched between.

Moreover, there is growing evidence that it is not actually so structured in specific domains, where perception and action share dynamic information-processing resources as embodied agents interact with their environments, 

rather than functioning as separate buffers around domain-general central cognition.

Rather, cognitive resources and structure can emerge, layer by layer, from informational dynamics, enabling both perception and action.

Imitation:
Imitative ability is rare across animal species and linked to characteristically human capacities: for language, culture, and understanding other minds (Arbib et al. (2000); Arbib 2005; Arbib {\&} Rizzolatti 1997; Barkley 2001; Frith {\&} Wolpert 2004; Gallese 2000; 2001; 2005; Gallese {\&} Goldman 1998; Gallese et al. 2004; Gordon 1995b; Iacoboni 2005; Meltzoff 2005; Rizzolatti {\&} Arbib 1998; 1999; Stamenov {\&} Gallese 2002; Tomasello 1999; Whiten et al. 2005b; Williams et al. 2001).

SCM:
SCM's central hypothesis is that associations underwriting predictive simulation of effects of an agent's own movement, for instrumental control functions, can also yield mirroring and “reverse” simulation of similar perceived movements by others.

Mirroring allows ends/ means associations with instrumental control functions to be accessed for simulative functions bilaterally,

so causes of observed movements can be simulated, as well as effects of intended acts.

Such bilaterally accessible simu- lations of instrumental structure can provide enabling information for deliberation, imitation, and understanding the instrumental acts of others.

Shared dynamics for action and perception can provide the foundations of shared dynamics for self and other, and of the self/other and actual/possible distinctions characteristic of human cognition.

SCM shows how information for important cognitive capacities of persons can have a foundation in the dynamic co-enabling of perception and action.

Specifically, materials for active perception can generate cognitively significant resources: 
- the action/perception, self/world, actual/possible, and self/other distinctions,
- intersubjective information enabling social learning and mindreading, and 
- counterfactual information enabling instrumental and strategic deliberation.},

abstract = {The problem, which has remained at the heart of anthropological attempts to understand the dynamics of culture, is to fathom how knowledge accumulation occurs. In both biology and psychology, according to the author, the crux of the problem lies in understanding processes of ontogenetic development. Following an outline of D. Sperber's (see record 2001-01499-001) approach to the explanation of culture, the author considers the problem of development as it figures in neo-Darwinian biology and secondly in cognitive science. The solution, the author argues, is to move beyond the dichotomy between innate capacities and acquired competencies, through a focus on the emergent properties of dynamic systems. Skills, the author suggests, are best understood as properties of this kind. It is through the process of enskilment, not enculturation, that every generation grows beyond the wisdom of its predecessors. This leads to the conclusion that in the growth of human knowledge, the contribution that each generation makes to the next is not an accumulated stock of representations but an education of attention.},

Return to PSYCHOLOGY:
Heavy on the genotype:
cognitive science posits a design for the mind that pre-exists and underwrites all subsequent learning or knowledge acquisition (evolved cognitiive mechanisms that are content rich).

the genetically specified cognitive devices that are supposed to make possible the transmission of representations must already exist, not merely in the virtual guise of a design, but in the concrete hardwiring of human brains

TOOBY {\&} COSMIDES; SPERBER:

Cognitive Science and "Orthodox interactionism"
Recalling the biological distinction between genotype and phenotype, Tooby and Cosmides argue that an equivalent distinction needs to be recognised in the study of mind - between evolved psychology and manifest psychology.

Every situation, then, may be analysed into 'environmental conditions, evolved architecture, and how their interaction produces the manifest outcome' (1992: 45-6).

Presented as a matter of expository convenience, this conflation of the manifest and the evolved is more in the nature of a cover-up that enables them to get away with talking about cognitive mechanisms as if they were already in place and fully operational, constructed by the great master-builder of evolution, natural selection.

Example: LANGUAGE ACQUISITION

'language acquisition device' (LAD)

An infant reared in social isolation, and thus deprived of the relevant environmental input, would not learn a language, but would still possess a fully formed LAD (Tooby and Cosmides 1992: 45)

Is there any basis in reality for separating out the construction of 'innate' psychological mechanisms from the transmission of 'acquired' cultural representations, as shown in Figure 3, or is the division into these two stages no more than an artefact of our own analytic procedures?

Ingold's Critique of LAD:

The first point to note is that the mechanisms (if we can call them that) underwriting the child's ability to speak are not constructed in a vacuum, but rather emerge in the context of his or her sensory involvement in a richly structured environment.

the infant is immersed in a world of sound in which the characteristic patterns of speech mingle with all the other noises of everyday life, and is surrounded by variously accomplished speakers who provide support in the form both of contextually grounded interpretations of the infant's vocalisations and of demonstrations, or 'attention-directing gestures' (Zukow-Goldring 1997: 221-3), to accompany their own.

This environment, then, is not a source of variable input for pre-constructed mechanisms, but rather furnishes the variable conditions for the self-assembly, in the course of early development, of the mechanisms themselves. 

The real design specifications then, are not given by the genotype, but by the dynamical laws and principles of systems?

And as the conditions vary, so the resulting mechanisms will take manifold forms, each differentially 'tuned' both to specific sound-patterns and to other features of local contexts of utterance. These variably attuned mechanisms, and the competencies they establish, are of course the neurophysiological correlates of what appear to us as the diverse languages of the world.

Language, in this sense, is not acquired. Rather, it is continually being generated and regenerated in the developmental contexts of children's involvement in worlds of speech (Lock 1980). And if language is not acquired, then there can be no such thing as an innate language acquisition device (Dent 1990).

Learning to catch, to climb, or to eat and drink, to cite a few of Sperber's examples (1996: 117), is a matter not of acquiring from an environment representations that satisfy the input conditions of preconstituted modules, but of the formation, within an environment, of the necessary neurological connections, along with attendant features of musculature and anatomy, that establish these various competencies.

In this sense, of imitation rather than transcription, copying is an aspect of a person's life in the world, involving repeated tasks and exercises - or what Whitehouse (1996: 113) aptly calls 'the labours of maturation'. It is through the work of copying, then, that the neurological foundations of human competencies are established.

modularity develops (Ingold 1994: 295), and that the precise way in which this packaging occurs will depend upon the particularities of environmental experience.

So is it because our environmental experience on the surface of the world is so roughly equivalent that we development seemingly equivalent cognitive mechanisms? 

My point is that these capacities are neither internally prespecified nor externally imposed, but arise within processes of development, as properties of dynamic self-organisation of the total field of relationships in which a person's life unfolds.

Example: throwing and catching

to account for its evolution we need to focus on the temporal unfolding of these systems and on their properties of dynamic self- organisation.

the evolutionary process becomes one in which organisms, through their presence and their activities, set up the developmental conditions under which their successors are destined to live out their lives. Likewise the manifold capacities of human beings, from throwing stones to bowling cricket-balls, ... emerge through the labours of maturation within fields of practice constituted by the activities of predecessors.

Capacities exist neither 'inside' the body and brain of the practitioner nor 'outside' in the environment. They are rather properties of environmentally extended systems that crosscut the boundaries of body and brain (A. Clark 1997: 214).

Wipe out the trails, and the ant is lost. So, indeed, would humans be, without culture or history.

Having dissolved the distinction between the innate and the acquired, we find that the parallel distinction between evolution and history falls with it.

What I find naive, to the contrary, is Sperber's belief that culture stands as 'content' to human psychology

Without doubt, people raised in different environments learn to perceive their surroundings, and to act within them, in different ways. We may even agree to call these differences cultural.

As such, however, they are not so much received into the 'capacities' of a universal psychology as immanent in that field of relations wherein human beings undergo the organic processes of growth and maturation, and in which their powers of action and perception are developed and sustained.

COMPETENCE?
The notion suggests a knowledgeability that is detached from action and from the contexts of actors' bodily engagement with the world, and that takes the form of interior rules or programmes capable of specifying, in advance, the appropriate behavioural response to any given situation.

A complex process model, by contrast, would regard the movement of the axe as part of the dynamic functioning of the entire system of relations constituted by the presence of the man, with his axe, in an environment that includes the tree as the current focus of his attention (Bateson 1973: 433). 

More generally, a model of the latter kind would treat performance not as the discharge of representations in the mind but as an achievement of the whole organism-person in an environment (Thelen 1995).

the product of this process is social alignment with others who share similar competencies.

SKILL:
human knowledgeability is founded not in some combination of innate capacities and acquired competence, but in skill (Rubin 1988, J. E. Clark 1997).

Ingold's conception of the SC Model: 
Top-down action plans: Once set upon a course of action, he cannot therefore alter it without interrupting the execution in order to reconfigure the plan in the light of new data. The movement of the skilled practitioner, by contrast, is continually and fluently responsive to perturbations of the perceived environment (Ingold 1993a: 462).

It is this responsiveness that underpins the qualities of care, judgement and dexterity that are the hallmarks of skilled workmanship (Pye 1968: 22). 

This is flow; click:

As Nicholai Bernstein wrote some fifty years ago, the essence of dexterity lies not in bodily movements themselves but in the 'tuning of the movements to an emergent task',

the more skilled the practitioner, the less 'working out' is needed: thus what distinguishes the expert from the relative novice is not the complexity or elaborateness of his plans or representations but the extent to which he can dispense with them. 'When things are proceeding normally', as Dreyfus and Dreyfus put it, 'experts don't solve problems and don't make decisions; they do what normally works' (1986: 30-1)

And so: bonding is not a representation, but an achievement of skill - 

As an expertise increases, intra- and inter-individually, flow increases, explicit representation and associated attentional processes decreases (Boubossan)

Cook book example:
The verbal commands of the recipe, in other words, draw their meaning not from their attachment to mental representations in my head, but from their positioning within the familiar context of my activity in the home. Like signposts in a landscape, they provide specific directions to practitioners as they make their way through a field of related practices - or what I have elsewhere called a 'taskscape' (Ingold 1993b: 158).

Each command is strategically located at a point which the original author of the recipe, looking back on previous experience of preparing the dish in question, considered to be a critical juncture in the total process. Between these points, however, the cook is expected to be able to find her way around, attentively and responsively, but without further recourse to explicit rules of procedure - or in a word, skilfully.

Thus the information in the recipe book is not, in itself, knowledge. Rather, it opens up a path to knowledge, thanks to its location within a taskscape that is already partially familiar by virtue of previous experience.

In short, the growth of knowledge in the life history of a person is a result not of information transmission but of guided rediscovery. I shall return to this distinction below, since it has a critical bearing on how we understand the process of copying

the deliberations of the novice are carried on not in an inner mental sanctum, closeted from the multiple domains of practical life, but in a real world of people, objects and relationships. The environment, then, is not merely a source of problems, of adaptive challenges to be resolved: it becomes part of the means for dealing with them.

The 'calculator', in other words, is not a device inside the head but the whole person in the world (Lave 1988: 154).

Along with parts of the body, aspects of the environmental setting are incorporated as integral parts of the 'device'. 

But this means, too, that calculation and implementation, far from being separate, successive stages of any operation, are merged as one and the same. 

THE EDUCATION OF ATTENTION:
The answer cannot lie in the transmission of representations - or of what D'Andrade (1981: 179) calls '"pass it along" type information' - since, as I have shown, this rests upon the impossible precondition of a ready-made cognitive architecture. 

human learning: there is no reading of a verbal script - such as that contained in the cookbook - that is not part of the novice's practical engagement with his or her environment.

Sperber's epidemiological model of cultural transmission: knowledge comes in the form of representations which pass from head to head by way of successive steps of behavioural externalisation and perceptual internalisation.

In principle, the recipe could be reread, by generation after generation, without any cookery having to take place at all. Cooking, in Sperber's account (and as shown schematically in Figure 4), is not copying, it is the expression of copies that are already established in the mind of the cook.


To reiterate my earlier point, copying is not the automatic transcription of mental content from one head to another, but is rather a matter of following what other people do. 

The novice watches, feels or listens to the movements of the expert, and seeks - through repeated trials - to bring his own bodily movements into line with those of his attention so as to achieve the kind of rhythmic adjustment of perception and action that lies at the heart of fluent performance (Gatewood 1985)

This seems to be in line with CAT - people don't go out into the world with the aim of copying cultural representations, they go out into the world attempting to engage in socially relevant practices and acquire socially faciliating skills...

For this process we have basal tendencies for movement: 

As Merleau-Ponty has observed, we do not so much copy other persons as copy their actions, and 'find others at the point of origin of these actions' (1964: 117).

'education of attention'. I take this phrase from James Gibson (1979: 254), whose attempt to develop an ecological psychology - that treats perception as the activity of the whole organism in an environment rather than that of a mind inside a body



This process of copying, as I have already shown, is one not of information transmission but of guided rediscovery.

Mixture of imitation and improvisation: Copying is imitative, insofar as it takes place under guidance; it is improvisatory, insofar as the knowledge it generates is knowledge that novices discover for themselves.

Gibson's point was that we learn to perceive not by taking on board mental representations or schemata for organising the raw data of bodily sensation, but by a fine-tuning or sensitisation of the entire perceptual system, comprising the brain and peripheral receptor organs along with their neural and muscular linkages, to particular features of the environment (Gibson 1979: 246-8).

To put it rather crudely, Gibson's novices are 'tuned up', Sperber's are 'filled up'.

Thus from a Gibsonian perspective, if the knowledge of the expert is superior to that of the novice, it is not because he has acquired mental representations that enable him to construct a more elaborate picture of the world from the same corpus of data, but because his perceptual system is attuned to 'picking up' critical features of the environment that the novice simply fails to notice.

The world, after all, is its own best model (A. Clark 1997: 29). 

Adopting one of Gibson's key metaphors, we could say that the perceptual system of the skilled practitioner resonates with the properties of the environment.

In the passage of human generations, each one contributes to the knowledgeability of the next not by handing down a corpus of disembodied, context-free information, but by setting up, through their activities, the environmental contexts within which successors develop their own embodied skills of perception and action. 

the human being emerges as a centre of awareness and agency whose processes resonate with those of its environment. 

Knowing... does not lie in the relations between structures in the world and structures in the mind, mediated by the person of the knower, but is immanent in the life and consciousness of the knower as it unfolds within the field of practice - the taskscape - set up through his or her presence as a being-in-the-world.


Cognition, in this sense, is a process in real time. 'Rather than speaking of ideas, concepts, categories and links', Gatewood suggests, 'we should think of flows, contours, intensities and resonances' (1985: 216).


three fallacies that lie at the heart of Sperber's approach to the explanation of culture. The first is that cultural knowledge takes the form of representations; the second is that these representations, in their mental modality, are stored within the containers of a universal psychology, whence they have to be retrieved prior to their practical enactment; the third is that in this enactment, a boundary is crossed between mental and public domains.

remembering not as the accessing of a complex structure, but as the unfolding of a complex process.

It would be wrong, as I have argued elsewhere (Ingold 1992: 51), to think of the interface between brain and environment as one of contact between two mutually exclusive domains, respectively mental and public; rather each - to use Bohm's (1980: 177) term - is 'implicate' in the other. 

Thus in the course of development, the history of a person's relations with his or her environment is enfolded in particular, neurologically grounded structures of awareness and response.},

abstract = {The enactive approach to cognition distinctively emphasizes autonomy, adaptivity, agency, meaning, experience, and interaction. Taken together, these principles can provide the new sciences of language with a comprehensive philosophical framework: languaging as adaptive social sense-making. This is a refinement and advancement on Maturana's idea of languaging as a manner of living. Overcoming limitations in Maturana's initial formulation of languaging is one of three motivations for this paper. Another is to give a response to skeptics who challenge enactivism to connect “lower-level” sense-making with “higher-order” sophisticated moves like those commonly ascribed to language. Our primary goal is to contribute a positive story developed from the enactive account of social cognition, participatory sense-making. This concept is put into play in two different philosophical models, which respectively chronicle the logical and ontogenetic development of languaging as a particular form of social agency. Languaging emerges from the interplay of coordination and exploration inherent in the primordial tensions of participatory sense-making between individual and interactive norms; it is a practice that transcends the self-other boundary and enables agents to regulate self and other as well as interaction couplings. Linguistic sense-makers are those who negotiate interactive and internalized ways of meta-regulating the moment-to-moment activities of living and cognizing. Sense-makers in enlanguaged environments incorporate sensitivities, roles, and powers into their unique yet intelligible linguistic bodies. We dissolve the problematic dichotomies of high/low, online/offline, and linguistic/nonlinguistic cognition, and we provide new boundary criteria for specifying languaging as a prevalent kind of human social sense-making.},

abstract = {Evolutionary psychology is an approach to the psychological sciences in which principles and results drawn from evolutionary biology, cognitive science, anthropology, and neuroscience are integrated with the rest of psychology in order to map human nature. By "human nature," evolutionary psychologists mean the evolved, reliably developing, species-typical computa- tional and neural architecture of the human mind and brain. According to this view, the functional components of this architecture were designed by natural selection to solve adaptive problems faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and to regulate behavior so that these adaptive problems were successfUlly addressed (for discussion, see Cosmides {\&} Tooby, 1987; Tooby {\&} Cosmides, 1992). Evolutionary psy- chology is not a specific subfield of psycholo- gy, such as the study of vision, reasoning, or so- cial behavior. It is a way of thinking about psychology that can be applied to any topic within it-including the emotions. The analysis of adaptive problems that arose ancestrally has led evolutionary psychologists to apply the concepts and methods of the cognitive sciences to scores of topics that are relevant to the study of emotion, such as the cognitive processes that govern cooperation, sexual attraction, jealousy, aggression, parental love, friendship, romantic love, the aesthetics of landscape preferences, coalitional aggression, incest avoidance, disgust, predator avoidance, kinship, and family relations (for reviews, see Barkow, Cosmides, {\&} Tooby, 1992; Crawford {\&} Krebs, 1998; Daly {\&} Wilson, 1988; Pinker, 1997). Indeed, a rich theory of the emotions naturally emerges out of the core principles of evolutionary psychology (Tooby, 1985; Tooby {\&} Cosmides, 1990a; see also Nesse, 1990). In this chapter we (1) briefly state what we think emotions are and what adaptive problem they were designed to solve; (2) explain the evolutionary and cognitive principles that led us to this view; and (3) using this background, explicate in a more detailed way the design of emotion programs and the states they create.},

Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic interpersonal coordination are sought in studies of sensorimotor and cognitive processes that play a role in the representation and integration of self- and other-related actions within and between individuals' brains. Finally, relationships between social-psychological factors and rhythmic interpersonal coordination are considered from two perspectives, one concerning how social-cognitive tendencies (e.g. empathy) affect coordination, and the other concerning how coordination affects interpersonal affiliation, trust and prosocial behaviour.

In particular, behavioral dynamics' ability to explain the temporal coordination of interacting individuals is detailed. Two experiments are then described that demonstrate how dynamical processes of synchronization are apparent in the coordination underlying everyday joint actions such as martial art exercises, hand-clapping games, and conversations. The import of this evidence is that emergent dynamic patterns such as synchronization are the behavioral order that any neural substrate supporting joint action (e.g., mirror systems) would have to sustain. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the major assumptions of influential ecological approaches on the human movement variability in sports and how it can be analyzed by benefiting from well-known measures of entropy. These measures are exploited so as to further understand the performance of athletes from a dynamical and chaotic perspective. Based on the presented evidences, entropy-based techniques will be considered to measure, analyze and evaluate the human performance variability under three different case studies: i) golf; ii) tennis; and iii) soccer. At a first stage, the athletes' performance will be analyzed at the individual level by considering the golf putting (pendulum movement) and the tennis serve (ballistic movement). Under these gestures, the approximate entropy is considered to extract the variability inherent to the process variables. Afterwards, the athletes' performance will be analyzed at the collective level by considering the soccer case (team sport). To that end, both approximate entropy and Shannon's entropy are mutually considered to assess the variability of football players' trajectory. To outline the applicability of entropy-based measures to analyze sports, this article ends with an overall reflection about the potential of such measures towards an increased understanding on the overall human performance. This methodology proves to be useful to provide decisive information and feedback for coaches, sports analysts and even for the athletes.},

We refer to this phenomenon as moral alchemy and suggest that it arises because moral obligations of care entail recursively valuing loved ones' values, thus allowing propositions with no moral weight in themselves to become morally charged. Within this framework, we predict that when people believe a loved one cares about a behavior more than they do themselves, the moral imperative to care about the loved one's interests will raise the value of that behavior, such that people will be more likely to infer that third parties will see the behavior as wrong (Experiment 1) and the behavior itself as more morally important (Experiment 2) than when the same behaviors are considered outside the context of a caring relationship. The current study confirmed these predictions.},

abstract = {In contrast with tribal and archaic religions, world religions are characterized by a unique emphasis on extended prosociality, restricted sociosexuality, delayed gratification and the belief that these specific behaviours are sanctioned by some kind of supernatural justice. Here, we draw on recent advances in life history theory to explain this pattern of seemingly unrelated features. Life history theory examines how organisms adaptively allocate resources in the face of trade-offs between different life-goals (e.g. growth versus reproduction, exploitation versus exploration). In particular, recent studies have shown that individuals, including humans, adjust their life strategy to the environment through phenotypic plasticity: in a harsh environment, organisms tend to adopt a ‘fast' strategy, pursuing smaller but more certain benefits, while in more affluent environments, organisms tend to develop a ‘slow' strategy, aiming for larger but less certain benefits. Reviewing a range of recent research, we show that world religions are associated with a form of ‘slow' strategy. This framework explains both the promotion of ‘slow' behaviours such as altruism, self-regulation and monogamy in modern world religions, and the condemnation of ‘fast' behaviours such as selfishness, conspicuous sexuality and materialism. This ecological approach also explains the diffusion pattern of world religions: why they emerged late in human history (500–300 BCE), why they are currently in decline in the most affluent societies and why they persist in some places despite this overall decline.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Anderson2010,
abstract = {An emerging class of theories concerning the functional structure of the brain takes the reuse of neural circuitry for various cognitive purposes to be a central organizational principle. According to these theories, it is quite common for neural circuits established for one purpose to be exapted (exploited, recycled, redeployed) during evolution or normal development, and be put to different uses, often without losing their original functions. Neural reuse theories thus differ from the usual understanding of the role of neural plasticity (which is, after all, a kind of reuse) in brain organization along the following lines: According to neural reuse, circuits can continue to acquire new uses after an initial or original function is established; the acquisition of new uses need not involve unusual circumstances such as injury or loss of established function; and the acquisition of a new use need not involve (much) local change to circuit structure (e.g., it might involve only the establishment of functional connections to new neural partners). Thus, neural reuse theories offer a distinct perspective on several topics of general interest, such as: the evolution and development of the brain, including (for instance) the evolutionary-developmental pathway supporting primate tool use and human language; the degree of modularity in brain organization; the degree of localization of cognitive function; and the cortical parcellation problem and the prospects (and proper methods to employ) for function to structure mapping. The idea also has some practical implications in the areas of rehabilitative medicine and machine interface design.},

focus lies on relationships between the simpler components within a single scale, for example, the scale of molecules, neurons, or neural structures, while assuming that these are independent from relationships at other scales. 

However, when multiple scales of the phenomenon are interacting, this fundamental assumption of component-dominant views breaks down.

This interdependency causes the breakdown of the fundamental assumptions of conven- tional statistical analyses and blends the abstract categories of level of consciousness, priming effects, motor error corrections, and mental sets into one coherent concept of cognition.

long-range autocorrelation that defines the memory of the under- lying cognitive system that can span thousands of trials. Thus, the presence of 1/f ?
fluctuation is illustrated by a regular, less-than-
random structure of the response series and implies that it cannot be considered as random noise around an average response time.


A Paradigm Shift:

In contrast to the above component-dominant perspectives, Van
Orden et al. (2003, 2005), followed by Kello et al. (2007), pro- posed a paradigm shift from considering 1/f ?
fluctuation as a quantitative by-product of scale-dependent processes to seeing the ? exponent as a universal signature of interaction-dominant dy- namics (Jensen, 1998).

These authors suggested that human cognition and behavior self-assemble critical states, allowing for flexible adaptation to changing circumstances. 

This interaction-dominant theory was inspired by the contemporary interdisciplinary literature of self-organizing critical systems that produce 1/f ? fluctuation as a statistical output (Bak, 1996; Jensen, 1998). 

Thus, 1/f ? power laws, thought to be ubiquitous in human
performance (e.g., Kello et al., 2007; Van Orden et al., 2003, 2005), are neither necessary nor sufficient evidence of interaction- dominant dynamics.

The second feature of prolonged response series is that they
possess a non-Gaussian distribution with heavy tails
These heavy tails arise from extreme response intervals and are often eliminated as singular or rare events.

The component-dominant models of human cognition cited above fail to reproduce the non-Gaussian distribution seen in the response series since they are based on a superposition of scale-dependent subprocesses that are Gaussian distributed

The main problem of equating multiplicative interactions with non- Gaussian distribution is that the probability density function does not contain information about the temporal ordering of the extreme trials within its tails. 

Intermittent behavior of com- plex systems has therefore been viewed as a property that is difficult to quantify by a single statistical parameter. 




The solution to this fundamental problem was developed by Mandelbrot (1974) through stationary models of multiplicative interactions between scale-dependent vertexes in fluid turbulence. These models were termed multiplicative cascading processes and classify intermittency in phenomena 

Common for these models is that the intermittent structure in time or space is defined by multiplicative interactions that transport energy and information across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

The present article develops a theoretical framework called behavioral dynamics that integrates an information-based approach to perception with a dynamical systems approach to action. For a given task, the agent and its environment are treated as a pair of dynamical systems that are coupled mechanically and informationally. Their interactions give rise to the behavioral dynamics, a vector field with attractors that correspond to stable task solutions, repellers that correspond to avoided states, and bifurcations that correspond to behavioral transitions. The framework is used to develop theories of several tasks in which a human agent interacts with the physical environment, including bouncing a ball on a racquet, balancing an object, braking a vehicle, and guiding locomotion. Stable, adaptive behavior emerges from the dynamics of the interaction between a structured environment and an agent with simple control laws, under physical and informational constraints.},

annote = {We live in a dynamically changing environment. In order to navigate such an environment successfully, we have to

1. adapt to the constantly changing demands that we face (adaptive response)

2. actively structure our physical and social environment to reduce its complexity and release cognitive resources. 
- relying on others who provide us with scaffolds given their specialized knowledge and competencies

The biological constitution of our bodies puts limits on how we structure and process the dynamic reality surrounding us.

An important aspect of this adaptive negotiation processes is the emergent nature of social cognition, namely the situatedness of social cognition.

cognitive processes emerge from adaptive sensorimotor interactions with a dynamically changing social and physical environment and are grounded by the constraints of the human body and the environment .


4 metaphors:

1. ‘social' is about two or more individuals in interdependence and the products of this interdependence.

the ‘social' is about how a bridge between individuals is established rather than about static concepts and their representation.

It is not about detached ‘concepts'. 

2. cognition is grounded by sensorimotor experiences. the idea that thinking is not driven exclusively by symbols but rather by multimodal states that activate the sensory- motor and affective systems.

“the body” plays a central role in shaping the contents of the mind. 


3. cognition is for action.

4. cognition is distributed: cognition is supplemented by the aid of tools and the exploitation of others.


The individual constituted a center stone for mainstream psychology similar to the pre-16th century geocentric view about the earth as the orbital center of all celestial bodies.

Similarly, the standard view of explaining human functioning (still) relies on the decontextualized individual as the unit of analysis. Moreover, it is assumed that explaining human functioning at the individual level will pave the way to grasping a more complex level, namely emergent behavior.

the individual constituted the level of analysis, with the added corollary that cognition could be analyzed and understood as symbolic mental structures and
SSC: 7 processes along with a set of combinatorial “rules” (e.g., Fodor, 1980; Smith, 1998).

Analogically, the level of analysis introduced by the situated cognition perspective places cognitive phenomena as emergent products in the situated context of social interaction in a physical environment.

Thus, the analysis of emergent phenomena is to be understood as being driven by the higher level of organization, namely a situated context that shapes how the specific parts are interlinked and not vice versa

Geocentric (Individual) versus Heliocentric (situated) view of cognition:

Essentially, the individual centered view was concerned with identifying invariants of psychological functioning, namely specific behaviors and their invariant meanings across contexts.

a more accurate characterization of how we navigate a dynamically changing social environment and pulls together some of the diverse parameters of this navigation process. 

It is simply the argument that conceptualizing human cognition as exclusively representational and thus symbolic ignores the fact that cognition is also bodily grounded and not merely symbolic. While this emphasis and redirection of scientific attention that has captured recent scholarly imagination is undoubtedly important, the research and argumentation under the exclusively embodiment banner (e.g., Barsalou, 1999, 2008) actually ignores the level of analysis umbrella that is advanced by the SSC perspective.

While the idea of a multi-pillar, holistic embodied/situational system is intuitively powerful in the abstract, the interactive nature of the components may run the risk of making testing it a highly challenging enterprise.

Mirror Neuron Discovery:
The discovery of the mirror neuron system (see Iacoboni, 2009; Rizzolatti
{\&} Craighero, 2004) highlighted the biologically distributed nature of knowledge, driven by the architecture of the human perceptuomotor system designed for the reproduction of movements of conspecifics in a privileged way (see Buccino, et al., 2004; Ferrari, Tramacere, Simpson, {\&} Iriki, 2013).

this research brought to the fore that there is a different ontological status of ‘social' knowledge compared to knowledge about the world in general. Social knowledge is underpinned by an isomorphism in mapping movements as a consequence of ‘synchronization' (Semin, 2007) processes.

Thus, social cognition is specialized for a distinctive class of stimuli: humans in interaction, and not about trees or cars (Semin {\&} Cacioppo, 2008, 2009). The biologically distributed nature of knowledge gives mutual access to and constitutes the foundations of communication (see Semin, 2007 for detail). The take away message of this section is that our bodies are involved in the way we represent others.

Embodiment:
A set of relatively invariable conditions (e.g., ecological, existential, material), including the architecture of our body constrains our experience of the world and our psychological functioning in general.

It is within these constraints that our actions and interactions take place, shaping the knowledge that we form, and allow us to navigate our social and physical world. 

-- So what makes us think that it would be otherwise?? 

the meaning of an object or a person does not merely consist of some abstract set of features but is shaped largely by the nature of the actions or interactions one engages may this be an object or a person (e.g.,


Motor theories of perception:

William James' account of “ideomotor action” (1890/1950) or 

Jean Piaget's developmental psychology, according to which cognitive abilities grew out from sensorimotor abilities were predicated upon precisely such a conception of knowledge. Another example is 

J. J. Gibson's (e.g., 1966) ecological psychology.

More recently, A. Clark's work (e.g., 2008), Brooks' contributions to robotics (e.g., 1999), and

W. Prinz's (e.g., 1984) common coding theory, according to which a shared representation or common code for perception and action exist are well-worked out examples of ‘embodiment'. 

What marks embodied approaches is its fundamental opposition to amodal approaches that conceptualize psychological functioning in terms of a closed loop of symbols or an internal model of the world. The extensive research on embodiment has shown that 

the body is not an output device for the computational processes on which cognition rests in representational models.

Cognition Is for Adaptive Action:
cognition as adaptive action is detached from the standard representational or information-processing paradigm of social cognition involving the construction and manipulation of inner representations that have no bearing on real interaction in and with the world

Modeling cognition in terms of abstract, detached symbolic representations has meant treating mental representations as invariant, timeless, and largely immune to contextual influences

The assumption that mental representations resist contextual factors makes it very difficult to reconcile with the fact that cognition needs to be adaptive to situational requirements.


Obviously, off-line cognition (Wilson, 2002) is important in a variety of situations involving, for instance, forward planning. But even this kind of cognition is situated in that it is a contextually simulated mental activity.


Situational Features effect on cognitive proccesses:

For example, attitudes have been shown to be responsive to a multitude of contextual effects (e.g., Schwarz {\&} Sudman, 1992), and stereotypes display considerable malleability in the face of changing contexts (e.g., Dovidio, Brigham, Johnson, {\&} Gaertner, 1996).

effects of the physical features of the environment on social cognitive processes:

Williams and Bargh (2008) have shown that receiving information about a hypothetical person while holding a cup of warm or cold coffee led to distinct personality impression of this hypothetical person on the warm–cold dimension.

Similarly, IJzerman and Semin (2009) observed that participants in a warmer room (relative to a colder room) reported higher social proximity to a target person.

social exclusion situations led people to feel colder (Zhong {\&} Leonardelli, 2008). 

Other physical features of the environment such as warm temperature, pleasant smell or closer physical distance also triggered more positive impressions about a target or uninvolved others (see Semin {\&} Garrido, 2012). 

The evidence for this adaptive nature can also be found in research highlighting the functions of those cognitive representations and processes, namely, as guides for action rather than internal states locked in the cranial vault.

Cognition is Distributed:

According to this view and the research conducted with this perspective, individuals in close relationships develop a distributed memory system, such that they divide responsibility for the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information from different domains

Thus, individuals in close relationships jointly remember information better than do individuals who do not share a systematic relatiosnhip (e.g., Andersson {\&} R{\"{o}}nnberg, 1995; Dixon {\&} Gould, 1996; Hollingshead, 1998; Wegner, 1986; Wegner et al., 1991). 

Moreover, social and material scaffolds also serve the function of releasing cognitive space as well as extending one's capabilities. Notably, such scaffolds constitute pervasive and integral aspects of our cognitive environment (see Palma, Garrido, {\&} Semin, 2014) and often constitute unrealized influences of our cognitive activities demanding much more careful attention in our research

Research over a recent span of 50 to 60 years has witnessed a gradual transition from demonstrating and explaining the very same psychological phenomena in terms of their invariant regularities to contextualizing these phenomena due to their increasing malleability as demonstrated with different experimental manipulations and conditions.

The gradual emergence of a situated understanding of psychological phenomena from an original invariant view of the very same phenomena are the indicators of a shift in paradigmatic thinking – much like Thomas Kuhn's analysis (1962).

Thus, instead of understanding embodied phenomena as invariantly anchored, one needs to examine the complex interplay between perceptual and motor representations as well as how people represent their selves in space.

Emotional Mimicry:
invariance assumption, namely that the facial display of a specific emotion is spontaneously copied in an unintended manner and occurs even when emotional faces are presented subliminally (Sonnby- Borgstr{\"{o}}m, 2002) or when participants are instructed to suppress imitation of the facial expression they see (Dimberg, Thunberg, {\&} Grunedal, 2002)

Hess and Fischer (2013): the “Matched Motor Hypothesis” – an automatic, unintentional synchronization of emotional expression between the stimulus and the participant's face (usually a photo or video)

The second invariance assumption was largely due to Ekman's argument that there are culturally universal facial expressions of emotions (Ekman, 1972; Ekman {\&} Friesen, 1975).

Invariance assumptions have been called into question: 
1. context sensitivity of mimicry
2. research questioning whether mimicry of discrete emotions is a tenable assumption in the first place. (The way an emotion is perceived in a face is arguably dependent on situated multimodal contexts affecting how a face is perceived and what type of emotion is expressed)

mental contents are often grounded in bodily experiences and go beyond mere symbolic, abstract and amodal representations. 

the mind needs the body to function.

Some argue that the
capacity to acquire semantic content that goes beyond perceptual experience reflects a fundamental design feature of human minds and that human conceptual system is characterized by a representational division of labor in which modal and amodal representations handle different aspects of our concepts (Dove, 2009; 2011)

Others claim that the evidence provided in support of embodied representations is also compatible with amodal representations (given certain auxiliary assumptions (e.g., Mahon {\&} Caramazza, 2008) and advance an alternative model suggesting that the core of a concept is amodal or symbolic and sensorimotor information is an embellishment, that “colors conceptual processing, enriches it, and provides it with a relational context" (Mahon {\&} Caramazza, 2008, p. 10)

A somehow similar proposal (Language and Situated Simulation – LASS; Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, {\&} Wilson, 2008) suggests that concepts are represented both in terms of linguistic representations and also in terms of sensorimotor simulations.

Their joint operation contributes to the representation of concepts, with the former, linguistic system, assumed to induce superficial processing and the latter, deeper conceptual processing via the simulation system

“To what extent do we use reenacted perceptual representations in cognition and to what extent do we use amodal representations? (Machery, 2007, p. 42).” the representation of concepts,

A view of cognition as infinitely malleable, distributed, and responsive to the physical and social context lacks predictive power. On the other hand, narrowing down the diverse constraints on human cognition, bodily, contextually, socially, and culturally as a systemic whole is an invitation towards an integrated science that is likely to pave the road towards a higher level of analysis and explanation.},

abstract = {Efforts at player motion tracking have traditionally involved a range of data collection techniques from live observation to post-event video analysis where player movement patterns are manually recorded and categorized to determine performance effectiveness. Due to the considerable time required to manually collect and analyse such data, research has tended to focus only on small numbers of players within predefined playing areas. Whilst notational analysis is a convenient, practical and typically inexpensive technique, the validity and reliability of the process can vary depending on a number of factors, including how many observers are used, their experience, and the quality of their viewing perspective. Undoubtedly the application of automated tracking technology to team sports has been hampered because of inadequate video and computational facilities available at sports venues. However, the complex nature of movement inherent to many physical activities also represents a significant hurdle to overcome. Athletes tend to exhibit quick and agile movements, with many unpredictable changes in direction and also frequent collisions with other players. Each of these characteristics of player behaviour violate the assumptions of smooth movement on which computer tracking algorithms are typically based. Systems such as TRAKUS, SoccerMan, TRAKPERFORMANCE, Pfinder and Prozone all provide extrinsic feedback information to coaches and athletes. However, commercial tracking systems still require a fair amount of operator intervention to process the data after capture and are often limited by the restricted capture environments that can be used and the necessity for individuals to wear tracking devices. Whilst some online tracking systems alleviate the requirements of manual tracking, to our knowledge a completely automated system suitable for sports performance is not yet commercially available. Automatic motion tracking has been used successfully in other domains outside of elite sport performance, notably for surveillance in the military and security industry where automatic recognition of moving objects is achievable because identification of the objects is not necessary. The current challenge is to obtain appropriate video sequences that can robustly identify and label people over time, in a cluttered environment containing multiple interacting people. This problem is often compounded by the quality of video capture, the relative size and occlusion frequency of people, and also changes in illumination. Potential applications of an automated motion detection system are offered, such as: planning tactics and strategies; measuring team organisation; providing meaningful kinematic feedback; and objective measures of intervention effectiveness in team sports, which could benefit coaches, players, and sports scientists.},

We examined the hand motions of preschool-age participants gathered during an executive-function task, card sorting, for evidence of multiplicative interactions across temporal scales. The time series of hand motions were submitted to iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transformation (IAAFT), a surrogate data analysis technique that removes nonlinear, multiscale dependencies while preserving the linear structure of the time series. We found that removing multiscale effects via IAAFT led to a significant change in the width of the multifractal spectrum, an indicator of multiplicative interactions.

Open nature of the model allows to study the effects of both static and time-dependent biases and information processing filters. In particular, the paper compares the effects of two important psychological mechanisms: the confirmation bias and the politically motivated reasoning. Depending on the effectiveness of the information filtering (agent bias), the agents confronted with an objective information source may either reach a consensus based on the truth, or remain divided despite the evidence. In general, the model might provide an understanding into the increasingly polarized modern societies, especially as it allows mixing of different types of filters: psychological, social, and algorithmic.},

@article{Sumpter2006,
abstract = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

Geometrical centers, radii, expansion speeds, possession functions of the two teams are defined and calculated as functions of time. Major ranges of all players as well as of different groups of players (defenders, midfielders, forwards) of the two teams during the entire first half, the attacking phase of team A and the attacking phase of team B are calculated, respectively, showing the structures of the two teams during different phases. Distance coverage of each player and the mean distances covered by different groups of players (defenders, midfielders, forwards) during different phases are calculated. The time portions of possession of the ball by each team and the time portions of different phases are also calculated. In Part II, energy and spectral analysis and various correlations will be derived. The relation between various parameters and potential indicators will be discussed. The major purpose of the present study is to offer some general mathematical tools for the detailed analysis and to reveal some general features of soccer match when the detailed 2D data are available. The results would offer the raw materials for various potential indicators which may eventually be used in the coaching process to enhance the performance and in the prediction of the results of soccer matches. 1.},

abstract = {This article discusses the main substantive issues surrounding performance analysis and considers future directions in this recently formed sub-discipline of sport science. It is argued that it is insufficient to bring together sport biomechanics and notational analysis on the basis that they share a number of commonalities, such as they both aim to enhance performance, they both make extensive use of information and communications technology, and both are concerned with producing valid and reliable data. Rather, it is suggested that the common factor linking sport biomechanics and notational analysis is that they can both be used to measure and describe the same phenomenon (i.e. emergent pattern formation) at different scales of analysis (e.g. intra-limb, inter-limb and torso, and inter-personal). Key concepts from dynamical system theory, such as self-organization and constraints, can then be used to explain stability, variability and transitions among coordinative states. By adopting a constraints-based approach, performance analysis could be effectively opened up to sport scientists from other sub-disciplines of sport science, such as sport physiology and psychology, rather than solely being the preserve of sport biomechanists and notational analysts. To conclude, consideration is given to how a more unified approach, based on the tenets of dynamical systems theory, could impact on the future of performance analysis.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT From a groups-as-information-processors perspective, the notion of shared cogni- tion is crucial to the understanding of team performance. This approach is used to comprehend the effectiveness of sports teams. Typically, sports teams are placed in a dynamic environment in which tasks are highly interdependent. Individual actions have to be coordinated with regard to the team objectives and with regard to the opponent team's actions. Although sports are considered behavioral tasks by their nature, performance may be strongly affected by cognitive processes. We review studies and give examples that demonstrate that the degree to which cognitions are shared and coordinated among the members of such teams influences the extent to which the individual actions are coordinated. The sharing and coordinating of cognitions pertain to the attention, information-processing, and action phases of the decision making and behavior process. We also discuss how feedback and coaching can affect information processing in teams such that coordination of ac- tions is more likely to arise.},

abstract = {Previous research has proposed that team coordination is based on shared knowledge of the performance context, responsible for linking teammates' mental representations for collective, internalized action solutions. However, this representational approach raises many questions including: how do individual schemata of team members become reformulated together? How much time does it take for this collective cognitive process to occur? How do different cues perceived by different individuals sustain a general shared mental representation? This representational approach is challenged by an ecological dynamics perspective of shared knowledge in team coordination. We argue that the traditional shared knowledge assumption is predicated on 'knowledge about' the environment, which can be used to share knowledge and influence intentions of others prior to competition. Rather, during competitive performance, the control of action by perceiving surrounding informational constraints is expressed in 'knowledge of' the environment. This crucial distinction emphasizes perception of shared affordances (for others and of others) as the main communication channel between team members during team coordination tasks. From this perspective, the emergence of coordinated behaviours in sports teams is based on the formation of interpersonal synergies between players resulting from collective actions predicated on shared affordances.},

We hypothesized that, under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony-a well-described phenomenon in biological and physical settings-could emerge spontaneously between humans as a result of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonal interactions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairs of participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions, while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed by someone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase and frequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developed and used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as they exchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed to coordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degree to which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the social encounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.},

The present study describes new methods for measuring interactional syn- chrony in natural interactions and evaluates whether the behavioral synchronization involved in social interactions is similar to dynamical synchronization found generically in nature. Two methodologies, a rater-coding method and a computational video image method, were used to provide time series representations of the movements of the co-actors as they enacted a series of jokes (i.e., knock–knock jokes). Cross-spectral and relative phase analyses of these time series revealed that speakers' and listeners' movements contained rhythms that were not only correlated in time but also exhibited phase syn- chronization. These results suggest that computational advances in video and time series analysis have greatly enhanced our ability to measure interactional synchrony in natural interactions. Moreover, the dynamical synchronization in these natural interactions is commensurate with that found in more stereotyped tasks, suggesting that similar organi- zational processes constrain bodily activity in natural social interactions and, hence, have implications for the understanding of joint action generally.},

annote = {SOCIAL-COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK:

The assumption of shared knowledge results from the possession by team members of complementary goals, strategies and relevant tactics that provide a basic shared understanding of desired performance outcomes, which underpins how each team member individually, and the team globally, aims to achieve performance goals (Ward {\&} Eccles, 2006).

Team members form clear expectations about each other's actions, allowing them to coordinate quickly and efficiently in adapting to the dynamic changes and demands of competitive performance environments, like sport, by selecting appropriate goal-directed actions to execute at appropriate times (Eccles, 2010; Salas et al., 1997).

eam efficacy may increase when a sophisticated, global and comprehensive representation of a collective action, linked to a mental representation of a performance context, is somehow shared by all players and put into practice. An asynchrony between the goals of individual performers and those of the team imply that a shared state has yet to be achieved, with resulting difficulties in coordination between performers (Eccles, 2010). 

The role of memory is emphasized in each individual player for successful team functioning. Practice and experience are deemed important for enhancing the encoding of domain-specific information in, and retrieval from, long-term memory structures (Eccles {\&} Tenenbaum, 2004).

They are also relevant for the formation of new and more elaborated mental representations, models or schemas, developed by performers for regulating behaviours in task-specific situations (Eccles, 2010; Eccles {\&} Tenenbaum, 2004).

Shared knowledge thus constitutes an emerging state that teams can reach, and the amount of such shared knowledge is assumed to discriminate between
novice and expert teams.

each team member can similarly figure out what other team members are doing and generate expectations about the behaviours that will occur within the team, such that coordination can be achieved.

it has been suggested that team members can acquire shared knowledge by explicit planning or by actual play (Eccles {\&} Tran-Turner, 2014).
Explicit planning means that coaches (or team leaders) communicate plans by introducing them verbally or by presenting them graphically.

This process often occurs in an off-the-field location, and aims at planning various levels of action (i.e. various levels of abstraction, such as planning outcomes, designs, procedures, or operations). Actual play leads to shared knowledge by playing the sport generally (i.e. practicing the sport regardless of the team in which they perform), and by playing within a particular team

(i.e. allowing for acquiring knowledge specific to the team under consideration) (e.g. Blickensderfer et al., 2010). This last process accounts for a dynamic and situated form of establishing shared knowledge

an updating of the individuals' representations is needed to maintain the accuracy of the knowledge that was shared prior to the performance (Uitdewilligen, Waller {\&} Pitariu, 2013)

either incidentally, and/or by deliberate means (Eccles, 2010; Eccles {\&} Tran- Turner, 2014)

Incidental: adapt to the unfolding game by changing some part of what was planned prior to the game

changes occur without explicitly intended communication within the team, and are thus facilitated when shared knowledge existed prior to the game that set the range of strategies available to the team.

Deliberate: When such an updating occur via deliberate means, it refers to a process by which team members deliberately communicate (i.e. verbally or not) with their teammates about how the plan has to be updated to better face upcoming events.

Although shared knowledge has tended to dominate research on mental
models in team behaviour, and is still accepted as a necessary pre-condition for the existence of team coordination, some investigators claim that it needs to be conceptually reformulated and much more carefully defined (Ward {\&} Eccles 2006).

Further, informational cues are likely to be used differently by each individual, according to their characteristics and each phase of play (Ward {\&} Eccles, 2006). Thus, knowing “who knows what” at each moment of a match would involve an immense mental load.

Particularly, the mechanism to explain re-formulations of a team member's
schema, when changes occur in the content of another member's schema, has proved difficult to verify (Mohammed, Klimoski {\&} Rentsch, 2000)

Moreover, several studies have failed to find significant relationships between measures of convergence of mental models and various dimensions of team performance (Mohammed {\&} Dumville, 2001).

Finally, it is hard to consider that representations exist beyond the boundaries of an individual organism and can be somehow shared (Riley, Richardson, Shockley {\&} Ramenzoni, 2011; Silva et al., 2013).

ENACTIVE APPROACH:
The enactive approach suggests that team coordination processes should be investigated by reconstructing how individual ‘cognitions' articulate during performance environments and by determining how these articulations are step- by-step adjusted over time.

Cognitions are described with respect to a phenomenological approach to humans, which assumes the sense-making process to highly contribute to the human/environment coupling.

Importantly, this framework aims to contribute to a paradigm shift in cognitive science: course-of-action researchers joined the enactive approach in calling for a rejection of the dominant positivist computationalist (i.e. cognitivist) paradigm (e.g. Varela, 1979, Varela et al., 1991)

Lived experience is not conceived as an epiphenomenal issue, but it is central to the situated achievement of human activity.

To go further, the “own-world” of the living being is primarily made by 
(a) the nature of its sensory apparatus, that is genetically inherited, 
(b) the history of the actor/environment coupling (e.g. recurrent patterns of perception and action building during individual development), and 
(c) the way the individual experiences his or her coupling with the environment in the moment (Thompson, 2011)

Focused in the claim that a living being possesses an interiority that escapes
any objectivist approach, this interiority has been the starting point of the descriptions of the actor/environment coupling.

To capture this interiority, the course-of-action framework includes a methodology that makes use of phenomenological forms of a posteriori interviews (e.g. self-confrontation interview techniques) to elicit subjective data

Together, the subjective and the observational data are combined to build units of activity that are, a posteriori, chained together sequentially, to describe any given individual's activity (see Theureau, 2003 for details).

After detailing the sense-making activity embedded in its context, as it was reported by the participants, researchers make use of additional processing regarding the particular object of their research (e.g. Braun {\&} Clarke, 2006)

enactive approach when investigating team coordination phenomena: the team cognition concept refers to the extent to which individual actors are mutually coupled – that is, the extent to which individual activities contribute to or perturb the activity of the others (De Jaegher {\&} Di Paolo, 2007; Laroche, Berardi {\&} Brangier, 2014).

From this perspective, it is assumed that a novel domain of phenomena emerges from the cooperative effort, the so-called ‘participatory sense-making' (De Jaegher {\&} Di Paolo, 2007)

Participatory sense-making processes refer to how social agents coordinate their sense-making during interaction (i.e. how the meanings that each individual builds in his/her activity corroborate with the meanings simultaneously built by co-performers) and how this participation in sense-making is experienced (De Jaegher {\&} Di Paolo, 2007; Froese {\&} Di Paolo, 2011).

The experience of the mutual engagement, in phenomenological terms, is thus assumed to be not prescribed by elements of knowledge or shared habits observable in the members' culture prior to the activity, but dynamically achieved in real-time by actors working together. 

Any divergence in how each member experiences the situation leads to various degrees of participation in sense- making, various feelings of connectedness with the other, and various expectancies for actions from others.

For example, the dyadic coordination in tennis doubles generally occurs in a context where the teammates do not necessarily build a similar perspective on the world (Poizat, Bourbousson, Saury {\&} S{\`{e}}ve, 2009).

When conducted in a basketball team, such an analysis contributes to observing how several singular perspectives on the world (i.e. many team members developing their activities individually) can harmoniously function together, despite the difficulty of drawing a stable common picture (e.g. Bourbousson, Poizat, Saury {\&} S{\`{e}}ve, 2012)

Procedure:
An enactive phenomenological analysis starts from a temporal account of how
each individual activity unfolds in the ongoing team coordination; and after this, it describes how individually perceived situations are arranged together by means of the adaptive activities of participants and the mediation of their physical environment.
For this second step, the analysis points out what is shared and what it is not depending on individuals' personal perspectives, rather than presupposing sharedness.
an enactive approach, and consequently the course-of- action framework that operationalizes it, always gives primacy to the individual subjective analysis, and only then, as a second step, describes the team

For analyzing team coordination there is a procedure called the ‘synchronization of the participants' courses of action'. In this analysis, for a given team the participants' individual courses of action are “connected” by presenting them side-by-side in chronological order.

The connection is achieved by scrutinizing correspondences between individual activities thanks to an objective description of the unfolding game, obtained, for example, by video recording.

the researcher may ask how the individual activities interplay according to the sharedness of their situated concerns (Bourbousson, Poizat, Saury {\&} S{\`{e}}ve, 2012) or the degree of sharedness of the contextual information taken into account by each teammate (Poizat et al., 2009).

Such a complementary combination of first- (the starting point of the analysis) and third-person approaches is needed to describe the actor/world coupling by considering the complex nature of the constraints that give rise to a perceived setting (i.e. physiological, cultural), and to consider the nature of the effects that a given experience of an action produces in the dynamics of the collective task.

Bourbousson and colleagues discussed the way in which most points of subjective interplays between players occurred at the local level (between two or three players). These local interplays may alternatively be seen in terms of the players' concerns (Bourbousson et al., 2012), the player's mutual awareness, the players' elements of knowledge (i.e. expectations for action for himself and for others, and recurrent expected patterns of perception and action) (Bourbousson et al., 2011), expectations and judgements about
the situation.

the situated interplays between team
members were constantly being modified; that the local participatory sense- making was dynamically created; and that the temporal interaction of the local instances of sharedness permitted the players to regularly revise their own perspective on the situation, update the sharing process, and even adopt a perspective similar to others.

the enactive approach goes beyond the positivist approach to cognitive science that tries to capture the objective world (independent of the perceiver, and by means that are neutral to the individual), to include analyses of the subjective experiences of the individual as the starting point. 

The risk of falling into a representational realm has to be thoroughly considered and managed by researchers in their procedures. To develop studies that contribute to a genuine enactive approach of human activity, the concept of (individual/environment) coupling also needs further elaboration and empirical description:

it is inadequate to understand the coupling by analysing only the individual side of it.

Research scientists often describe the asymmetry of the coupling as a consequence of the methods and not as a principle that has to be empirically described.

it is presupposed that the subjective
perspective of the actor defines the perturbations of the environment that contribute to the coupling, but
it is less well described how this subjective
experience is finely nested in the behavioural side of the coupling, or is produced by this behavioural dynamics.

How (individual or participatory) sense-making could be the starting point of how interpersonal interactions are shaped needs to be contrasted with studies that also consider the subjective facet as a consequence of such interaction.

ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS APPROACH:
investigating the dynamical principles that form the patterns of interpersonal coordination in daily contexts (Ara{\'{u}}jo et al., 2006, after Kelso, 1995; Warren, 2006; Schmidt et al., 1999).

The interpersonal patterns at the behavioural scale can be understood and modelled in terms of their own dynamics, without
investigating the micro level of the individual's interior
(Schmidt et al., 2011)

comprehends the interaction of system components to form stable behavioural patterns which can be characterized as attractor states of the system's dynamics (Schmidt et al., 1990)

Important for the study of the dynamics of interpersonal systems is the fact that synchronization process (i.e. the temporal coordination of unfolding events in a system) has been found to occur between biological rhythmic units that are connected not only mechanically but also informationally

dynamical synchronization process can operate across perceptual media to produce a coordinated timing of interpersonal coordination (Schmidt et al., 1990).

Systematically exploring the informational basis for the emergence of
interpersonal coordination and the dynamics that can allow the self-organization of coordinated action to occur is important to study, not because it implies humans do not have intentions, expectations and mental states, but rather because research demonstrates how integrally intertwined are body (e.g. nervous, physiological, psychological, movement) and contextual (e.g. social, cultural, climate, altitude) sub-systems when engaging in interpersonal coordination (Marsh et al., 2009),

and that a theory of the dynamics of self-organization is needed to understand the complexity of such interacting components (e.g. Kelso, 1995).

Ecological dynamics takes seriously the embodiment of cognition and the embeddedness in the environment (Richardson et al., 2008). 

With motion sensors, it is possible to examine the near-sinusoidal interpersonal rhythmic coordination of movement that is described by a motion equation known as the HKB model (Haken, Kelso {\&} Bunz, 1985; also see Kelso, 1995)

Related differential equations modelled dyadic interactions in team sports (Ara{\'{u}}jo et al., 2014), making predictions about the kinds of coordination that could and could not be sustained.

Following an environment-individual system perspective (J{\"{a}}rvilehto, 2009; Richardson et al., 2008), an ecological approach proposes that knowledge of the world is based upon recurrent processes of perception and action through which humans perceive affordances (i.e. opportunities for action; see Gibson, 1979).

The concept of affordances presupposes that the environment is directly perceived in terms of what actions a performer can achieve within a performance environment (i.e. it is not dependent on a perceiver's expectations, nor mental representations, nor interpretations linked to specific performance solutions) (Richardson, Shockley, Fajen, Riley {\&} Turvey, 2008)

Ecological perspective posits that meanings, the value possibilities for action in the environment, are directly perceived by individuals in that environment.

Extending this idea to an interpersonal level, ecological dynamics predicts that the presence of others extends the action possibilities (“affordances”) that are realizable by individuals to action possibilities realizable by groups.

Therefore an interpersonal system can be seen as a new entity with new abilities, and that the emergence of such a social synergy should be predictable using affordance theory (Gibson, 1979; Marsh et al., 2009).

Indeed, affordances can be perceived by a group of individuals trained to become perceptually attuned to them (Silva et al., 2013). In collective sports, both teams have the same objective (i.e. to overcome the opposition and win). Hence, the perception of collective affordances acts as a selection pressure for overcoming opponents and achieving successful performances (Reed, 1996)

In this sense, collective affordances are sustained by the common goals of team members who cooperate to achieve group success. From this perspective, team coordination depends on the team's collective attunement to shared affordances founded on a prior platform of (mainly non- verbal) communication or information exchange (Silva et al., 2013).

Through practice, players become perceptually attuned to affordances of others and affordances for others during competitive performance, and refine their actions (Fajen, Riley {\&} Turvey, 2009) by adjusting behaviours to functionally adapt to those of other teammates and opponents (see

This process enables them to act synergistically with respect to specific team goals (Ara{\'{u}}jo et al., 2015).

An important feature of a synergy is the ability of one of its components (e.g. a player) to lead changes in others (Riley et al., 2011).

he decisions and actions of players forming a synergy should not be viewed as independent, and can explain how multiple players act
in accordance with dynamic performance
environments in fractions of a second (Silva et al. 2015)

Therefore, the coupling of players as independent degrees of freedom into integrated synergies is based upon a social perception-action system supported by perception of shared affordances (Silva et al., 2013).

predictions about the conditions under which individuals will be better able to coordinate their movement with others, and what features of a situation facilitate/perturb interpersonal coordination in completing some task

Experimental designs, following an ecological dynamics perspective, need to focus on player- player-environmental interactions that can be elucidated in compound variables specifying functional collective behaviours of teams (e.g. geometrical centres),

An important pedagogical principle in sport is the need to ensure that there is adequate ‘sampling' of informational variables from the performance environment in a practice task, ensuring that modified tasks will correspond to an actual competition context so that important sources of information are present (Ara{\'{u}}jo {\&} Davids, 2015/in press)

it can also be seen more fundamentally as a manifestation of an integrative conceptual framework and research paradigm for psychological processes at all levels of human functioning, from brain dynamics to societal dynamics. 

For example, social interaction in one context (e.g. interaction among friends)
may be expressed differently from social interaction in a different context (e.g. interaction with adversaries), but the foundational laws of dynamics and self- organization are presumably the same in both contexts.

More importantly, emergence via self-organization is a general phenomenon that can be manifested in different ways. It is important to take ecologies seriously and try to understand the specific form that interpersonal coordination takes in various social contexts (Vallacher {\&} Jackson, 2009).

Finally, an important issue is the explanation of how affordances for interpersonal interaction are selected from a world full of other possibilities (Beek, 2009; Withagen et al., 2012)

Indeed, the fact that performers are coupled does not clarify what the perceived affordance was, or which source of information is constraining the link.

CONCLUSION: 

the socio-cognitive approach to understanding team coordination in sports involves the idea of team cognition grounded on the premise of shared knowledge of the performance environment, internalised among all team members (Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993).

annote = {How does entrainment and competence or familiarity with others change the mode in which you regulate joint-action?

Eccles {\&} Tenenbaum (2004) suggest that there is a pathway from explicit to implicit regulation processes in team coordination learning. 




hat they use to manage their progression, the mode they use to maintain/change the flow of their joint action effectiveness

(a) rowers will increase the proportion of cycles lived as “meaningless” (i.e., SSE-M), thus signing an increasing extra-personal mode of regulation of their continuous joint action. At the same time, they maintain an inter-personal mode of regulation to manage race events, evidenced through momentary salient experiences of joint action effectiveness that is rooted in interpersonal mechanical states; or 

(b) rowers will also gradually learn to regulate the sudden events through an extra-personal mode of regulation, evidenced through salient experiences of joint action effectiveness that is rooted in the boat's mechanical variation

Our suggestion is that, as long as rowers experienced simultaneously their co-regulation of the joint action, the joint performance did not suffer from each rower judging effectiveness differently. 

This corroborates that team coordination patterns of movement may occur without a perfectly shared experience about the ongoing joint action (Bourbousson et al., 2011, 2012)

the present study provided further evidence that the full coordination of sense-making activities is not needed to allow for a viable patterned joint action in a natural task, as long as actors are simultaneously involved in co-regulating their collective behavior (Froese and Di Paolo, 2011; Froese et al., 2014a,b).

Thus, as recently introduced as a hot topic in sports team coordination research (Araujo and Bourbousson, 2016), future research should consider the ways in which the extrinsic facet of the coordination process (e.g., the behavioral facet) and the phenomenological facet are mutually constrained to give rise to collective effectiveness in a task.

Insights into Team Coordination Phenomena in General
the team members combined two ways of regulating their joint action throughout the race, namely ameaningless regulation and a salient, meaningful regulation of the joint action. 

Second, the team members also combined two distinct modes of regulation, inter- and extra- personal.

research should question the settings' characteristics that are particularly propitious for one of these processes:

- the environmental mediation possibilities might call for a prevalence of extra-personal regulation. 
- Also, the number of participants involved in the collective behavior might make the inter-personal regulation process hard to manage (i.e., each participant cannot regulate all the dyadic linkages included in the collective), so that extra-personal processes might become parsimonious and preferable when environmental mediation is available. 

- Secondly, Secondly, research should question to what extent training practices could change regulation, and for which benefits such transformations might occur.

- Thirdly, research might identify the parameters that control how actors switch dynamically from one regulation process to another during an unfolding joint action.

our opinion is that future avenues will benefit from considering hypotheses included in the stigmergic theory of collective behavior (Susi and Ziemke, 2001; Avvenuti et al., 2013) in which holistic phenomena of coordination might be considered as emerging from the behavior–environment coupling. 

Stigmergic theory of collective behavior explains how each agent of the social system regulates its own behavior–environment coupling, without the agents needing to actively and directly coordinate with other agents, and without them needing to be aware of these cooperating agents.

Of interest is that no evidence of such processes has been discussed extensively in human collective behavior. The scarce references made to such collective behaviors (e.g., Bourbousson et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2014) have neglected the stigmergic hypothesis and instead have adopted the local- and-distributed mode of coordination, i.e., humans can exhibit a patterned collective behavior without needing to grasp the global properties of the social structure to which they contribute.

When considering that stigmergic processes do not require the actors to be aware of the collective behavior (e.g., like social insects that do not experience a sense of working together), then stigmergic processes could explain why in this study, the rowers were in synch for the three quarters of the race without simultaneously having a salient, meaningful experience of their joint action effectiveness

For instance, when the extra-personal mode of regulation (i.e., stigmergic) is needed to become an expert crew in rowing, it also seems to operate easily in a novice crew (despite their intentional subjective regulation being shaped by inter-personal processes)

the present method instantiates the concept of human movement as a place of interplay of behavioral and phenomenological facets (Froese and Di Paolo, 2010), and a concept of team coordination as a simultaneous combination of the behavioral dynamics of a joint effort (i.e., non-accidental correlations between the movements of the participants) and participatory sense-making dynamics (i.e., each participant constraining the own-world of the other). 

the interiority of individuals that is not always captured by objectivist approaches. Here, taking into account lived experiences helped to make sense of variability in the objective data, and illustrated how this interiority might be the starting point to describe actor/environment coupling, including actor/actor coupling.

a promising question may be to focus on team coordination training, first, by addressing how such a practice may progressively change the saliency of the participants' lived experiences of joint action and second, by addressing how it may change the behavioral signatures in which those lived experiences are anchored.},

abstract = {Similar to other complex systems in nature (e.g., a hunting pack, flocks of birds), sports teams have been modeled as social neurobiological systems in which interpersonal coordination tendencies of agents underpin team swarming behaviors. Swarming is seen as the result of agent co-adaptation to ecological constraints of performance environments by collectively perceiving specific possibilities for action (affordances for self and shared affordances). A major principle of invasion team sports assumed to promote effective performance is to outnumber the opposition (creation of numerical overloads) during different performance phases (attack and defense) in spatial regions adjacent to the ball. Such performance principles are assimilated by system agents through manipulation of numerical relations between teams during training in order to create artificially asymmetrical performance contexts to simulate overloaded and underloaded situations. Here we evaluated effects of different numerical relations differentiated by agent skill level, examining emergent inter-individual, intra- and inter-team coordination. Groups of association football players (national--NLP and regional-level--RLP) participated in small-sided and conditioned games in which numerical relations between system agents were manipulated (5v5, 5v4 and 5v3). Typical grouping tendencies in sports teams (major ranges, stretch indices, distances of team centers to goals and distances between the teams' opposing line-forces in specific team sectors) were recorded by plotting positional coordinates of individual agents through continuous GPS tracking. Results showed that creation of numerical asymmetries during training constrained agents' individual dominant regions, the underloaded teams' compactness and each team's relative position on-field, as well as distances between specific team sectors. We also observed how skill level impacted individual and team coordination tendencies. Data revealed emergence of co-adaptive behaviors between interacting neurobiological social system agents in the context of sport performance. Such observations have broader implications for training design involving manipulations of numerical relations between interacting members of social collectives.},

abstract = {A crucial aspect in rowing is having a synchronized, highly-efficient stroke. This is very difficult to obtain, due to the many interacting factors that each rower of the crew must perceive. Having a system that monitors and represents the crew coordination would be of great help to the coach during training sessions. In the literature, some methods already employ wireless sensors for capturing motion patterns that affect rowing performance. A challenging problem is to support the coach's decisions at his same level of knowledge, using a limited number of sensors and avoiding the complexity of the biomechanical analysis of human movements. In this paper, we present a multi-agent information-processing system for on-water measuring of both the overall crew asynchrony and the individual rower asynchrony towards the crew. More specifically, in the system, the first level of processing is managed by marking agents, which release marks in a sensing space, according to the rowers' motion. The accumulation of marks enables a stigmergic cooperation mechanism, generating collective marks, i.e., short-term memory structures in the sensing space. At the second level of processing, information provided by marks is observed by similarity agents, which associate a similarity degree with respect to optimal marks. Finally, the third level is managed by granulation agents, which extract asynchrony indicators for different purposes. The effectiveness of the system has been experimented on real-world scenarios. The study includes the problem statement and its characterization in the literature, as well as the proposed solving approach and initial experimental setting.},

The results were used to characterise the contents of the shared knowledge (i.e. regarding teammate characteristics, team functioning, opponent characteristics, opposing team functioning and game conditions) and to identify the characteristic types of change: (a) the reinforcement of a previous element of shared knowledge; (b) the invalidation of an element of shared knowledge; (c) fragmentation of an element of shared knowledge; (d) the creation of a new element of shared knowledge. The discussion deals with the diverse types of change in shared knowledge and the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of common ground within the team.

This approach is used to comprehend the effectiveness of sports teams. Typically, sports teams are placed in a dynamic environment in which tasks are highly interdependent. Individual actions have to be coordinated with regard to the team objectives and with regard to the opponent team's actions. Although sports are considered behavioral tasks by their nature, performance may be strongly affected by cognitive processes. We review studies and give examples that demonstrate that the degree to which cognitions are shared and coordinated among the members of such teams influences the extent to which the individual actions are coordinated. The sharing and coordinating of cognitions pertain to the attention, information-processing, and action phases of the decision making and behavior process. We also discuss how feedback and coaching can affect information processing in teams such that coordination of ac- tions is more likely to arise.},

@article{Duarte2012,
abstract = {Significant criticisms have emerged on the way that collective behaviours in team sports have been traditionally evaluated. A major recommendation has been for future research and practice to focus on the interpersonal relationships developed between team players during performance. Most research has typically investigated team game performance in subunits (attack or defence), rather than considering the interactions of performers within the whole team. In this paper, we offer the view that team performance analysis could benefit from the adoption of biological models used to explain how repeated interactions between grouping individuals scale to emergent social collective behaviours. We highlight the advantages of conceptualizing sports teams as functional integrated 'super-organisms' and discuss innovative measurement tools, which might be used to capture the superorganismic properties of sports teams. These tools are suitable for revealing the idiosyncratic collective behaviours underlying the cooperative and competitive tendencies of different sports teams, particularly their coordination of labour and the most frequent channels of communication and patterns of interaction between team players. The principles and tools presented here can serve as the basis for novel approaches and applications of performance analysis devoted to understanding sports teams as cohesive, functioning, high-order organisms exhibiting their own peculiar behavioural patterns.},
annote = {A team requires functional integration, but at the same time also benefits from interindividual variation:

"a valuable process that can lead to system variability and yiled a continual supply of new solutions to the behavioural challenges that groups face" (635)

Complex biological systems face a complementary interplay between functional specialisation tendencies (based on interindividual variation) and functional integration tendencies"

SUPERORGANISM:
"a group of individuals self-organised by division of labour and united by a closed system of communication" (Holldobler {\&} Wilson 2009, p.g. 84)


Passos et al.
showed that an attacking sub-group with a ball generated information for each individual to decrease interpersonal distances with other players and act as a single cohesive social unit during its approach to a subgroup of defenders (funtional integration).

each performer possessed different characterics that indluenced their action capabilities, which constrained each individual to display their own idiosyncratic behaviours (division of labour).


DIVISION of LABOUR
1. measuring the area of a performer's interventions on-field (the major range).

the predominant area of each individual's interventions during performance is defined by an ellipse centred at the 2-dimensional mean location of each performer, with semi-axes being the standard deviations in X and Y directions. 

COMMUNICATION SYSTEM:
1. Network analysis: preferred channels of communication within a team (dyadic/triadic interactions between performers?)
Dominant relations and probabilities of interaction among teammates can be assessed using this method.
Netowrks could be constructed according to passing accuracy (Duch et al. 2010)


COMPOUND POSITION VARIABLES:
compound position variables integrate the individual positions of each team player into a meaningful description of a collective team pattern.  

i) the surface area occupied by teams, which represents the covered area of the field by the whole team in each frame
ii) the geometrical centre of teams (centre of mass of a team)
iii) the stretch index of teams (the radius), represents the mean dispersion value of the players around the centre of each team
iv) the team ranges (legnth and width of the team in 2D space)

These measures can be used to measure the idiosyncratic performance values of each team.

can assist understanding of interactions between agents in sports teams as having "superorganismic qualities.

observing their changes on different time scales, due to variations in performance constraints, such as evolving scoreline, or different offensive playing styles, is an important aspect to consider in future performance evaluations.  

Need to discriminatie between defending and attacking performance phases...

team players may not always have the same weight in the emergence of the social collective system behaviours

the weighting of the contribution of each player may change as a function of the evolving game context (where the ball is located on the field) and the action capabilities of each inidividual.

Emerging Approaches

1. CLUSTER PHASE
synchrony within systems 

"Kuramoto order parameter" describes the synchronisation of oscillatory movement components (e.g. team players) in a single collective parameter

Can measure the contribution of each team player to the global behaviour of a team, as well as changes in the global synchronisation tendencies within a team

2. DOMINANT REGION
a region of the field space where a particular performer is likely to arrive earlier than other players.  

specifies movement possibilitiesand the functional area of intervention behind the control of each specific player.  

the weighted contribution of each player interacting togehter with his/her teammates and opponents originates a purposeful aggregation (functional integration) which can collectively express space-time relations between teams:

Dominance diagrams integrating the sphere of influence of all players can be visualised in a frame-by-frame manner depending on the sampling rate of positional data.  

3.  MODELLING 
Agent based modelling, SPP models

Models could help coaches predict how attacking and defensive formations might change during the course of a match as specific individuals become fatigued, weather conditions deteriorate, or if the competetive performance constraints of a game changes from beginning to end},

The system dynamics showed hysteresis: A past-action mode persisted when both solo and joint actions were possible. Moreover, pairs whose arm spans were both short, both long, or mismatched made action-mode transitions at similar points, when scaled by a relational measure. The relational measure of plank length to arm span was dictated by the pair member with the shorter arm span, who, thus, had a greater need to cooperate during the task. The results suggest that understanding affordances for cooperation requires giving more consideration to constraints imposed by the fit between coactors' action capabilities.},

abstract = {Traditional theories of cognitive science have typically accounted for the organization of human behavior by detailing requisite computational/representational functions and identifying neurological mechanisms that might perform these functions. Put simply, such approaches hold that neural activity causes behavior. This same general framework has been extended to accounts of human social behavior via concepts such as "common-coding" and "co-representation" and much recent neurological research has been devoted to brain structures that might execute these social-cognitive functions. Although these neural processes are unquestionably involved in the organization and control of human social interactions, there is good reason to question whether they should be accorded explanatory primacy. Alternatively, we propose that a full appreciation of the role of neural processes in social interactions requires appropriately situating them in their context of embodied-embedded constraints. To this end, we introduce concepts from dynamical systems theory and review research demonstrating that the organization of human behavior, including social behavior, can be accounted for in terms of self-organizing processes and lawful dynamics of animal-environment systems. Ultimately, we hope that these alternative concepts can complement the recent advances in cognitive neuroscience and thereby provide opportunities to develop a complete and coherent account of human social interaction.},
annote = {The field of cognitive science has customarily explained human behavior as the output of a computational system. Generally, these theories contend that behavior is organized and controlled via cognitive processes manifest in the activities of the central nervous system, which form representations of the environment from incoming sensory stimulation, and plan actions in accor- dancewith these representations (e.g., von Eckardt, 1993;Kawato, 1999).

widespread support for a “neuromechanistic” account of social behavior (but see Jacob and Jeannerod, 2005; Dinstein et al., 2008; Hickok, 2009). In summary, this account holds that the activity of specific neural structures constitutes the causal organization of social interactions.

Exclusive explanatory recourse to the activity of neural structures fails to appreci- ate the complete behavioral contexts in which these structures have emerged and in which they perform their functions.

SYSTEMS THEORY:
dynamical systems theory attempts to account for how
behavior emerges as a result of coupling enforced on componential interactions by relevant constraints.


the dynamical systems approach does not assert
that mechanical, efficient causal processes are inconsequential to an account of system behavior

What this approach contends is that efficient causal interactions between components are themselves subject to the constraints imposed at the level of the complete system.

global behavioral regularities are understood as the expression of interaction-dominants dynamics (see van Orden et al., 2003).

Unlike a truly mechanical, component-dominant system (e.g., watch, engine, computer), in which behavior is the final out- put of efficient causal links between functionally independent mechanisms, an interaction-dominant system entails a func- tional interdependence between components. 

Thus, the interaction itself is critical to an account of the observed behavior.


These theoretical aspirations are no different in the case of human behaviors; provideprovide an account of howsystem components (e.g., limbs, dance partners, societies) are coupled to produce states of behavioral regularity (e.g., walking, waltzing, warring).

Central to this account of human behavior is the concept of synergies or coordinative structures (e.g., Bernstein, 1967; Turvey et al., 1978; Kelso, 1984)


COORDINATIVE STRUCTURES / SYNERGIES:

A synergy is a temporarily assembled, task-specific, functional coupling between a system's componen- tial degrees-of-freedom (see Kelso, 2009)

Just as oil molecules self-organize into convection rolls in accordance with thermodynamic constraints, the componential degrees-of-freedom of the human motor system (e.g., neurons, muscles, limbs) self-organize into synergetic units in accordance with the constraints imposed in the animal-environment relationship.

For instance, Saltzman and Kelso (1987) state thatmotor degrees-of-freedom are coordinated to behave as synergies by the dynamical constraints of a given task.

Organizing the motor system into synergetic structures greatly simplifies the problems of motor control {\textless}- it reduces uncertainty!

Once coordinated to behave as a func- tional unit, the individual degrees-of-freedom do not need to be controlled independently of one another, and perturbations applied to a component are automatically compensated by the coupled components (e.g., Kelso, 1984; Latash et al., 2002; Riley et al., 2011)

a general dynamical theory of social behavior, the study of coordination dynamics (i.e., spatio-temporal entrainment) has provided a particularly interesting example of self-organizing processes in human social interaction in the case of interpersonal rhythmic coordination (e.g., Kelso, 1995;Marsh et al., 2006; Schmidt and Richardson, 2008).

Rhythmic coordination:
inphase coordination is more stable (i.e., less variable) than antiphase coordination, and thus, can be performed across a broader range of frequencies. Indeed, participants instructed to produce antiphase coordination spon- taneously transitioned to the inphase mode at faster movement frequencies},

abstract = {Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969/1982) posits the existence of internal working models as a foundational feature of human bonds. Radical embodied approaches instead suggest that cognition requires no computation or representation, favoring a cognition situated in a body in an environmental context with affordances for action (Chemero, 2009; Barrett, 2011; Wilson and Golonka, 2013; Casasanto and Lupyan, 2015). We explore whether embodied approaches to social soothing, interpersonal warmth, separation distress, and support seeking could replace representational constructs such as internal working models with a view of relationship cognition anchored in the resources afforded to the individual by their brain, body, and environment in interaction. We review the neurobiological bases for social attachments and relationships and attempt to delineate how these systems overlap or don't with more basic physiological systems in ways that support or contradict a radical embodied explanation. We suggest that many effects might be the result of the fact that relationship cognition depends on and emerges out of the action of neural systems that regulate several clearly physically grounded systems. For example, the neuropeptide oxytocin appears to be central to attachment and pair-bond behavior (Carter and Keverne, 2002) and is implicated in social thermoregulation more broadly, being necessary for maintaining a warm body temperature (for a review, see IJzerman et al., 2015b). Finally, we discuss the most challenging issues around taking a radically embodied perspective on social relationships. We find the most crucial challenge in individual differences in support seeking and responses to social contact, which have long been thought to be a function of representational structures in the mind (e.g., Baldwin, 1995). Together we entertain the thought to explain such individual differences without mediating representations or computations, but in the end propose a hybrid model of radical embodiment and internal representations.},

abstract = {Background: Interpersonal coordination is an essential aspect of daily life, and crucial to performance in cooperative and competitive team sports. While empirical research has investigated interpersonal coordination using a wide variety of analytical tools and frameworks, to date very few studies have employed multifractal techniques to study the nature of interpersonal coordination across multiple spatiotemporal scales. In the present study we address this gap. Methods: We investigated the dynamics of a simple dyadic interpersonal coordination task where each participant manually controlled a virtual object in relation to that of his or her partner. We tested whether the resulting hand-movement time series exhibits multi-scale properties and whether those properties are associated with successful performance. Results: Using the formalism of multifractals, we show that the performance on the coordination task is strongly multi-scale, and that the multi-scale properties appear to arise from interaction-dominant dynamics. Further, we find that the measure of across-scale interactions, multifractal spectrum width, predicts successful performance at the level of the dyad. Conclusion: The results are discussed with respect to the implications of multifractals and interaction-dominance for understanding control in an interpersonal context.},

Here we argue that for cognition to be embodied and sometimes embedded, means that the cognitive faculty cannot be localized in a brain area alone. We review recent research on neural reuse, the 1/f structure of human activity, tool use, group cognition, and social coordination dynamics that we believe demonstrates how the boundary between the different areas of the brain, the brain and body, and the body and environment is not only blurred but indeterminate. In turn, we propose that cognition is supported by a nested structure of task-specific synergies, which are softly assembled from a variety of neural, bodily, and environmental components (including other individuals), and exhibit interaction dominant dynamics.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the perception of possibilities for action (i.e., affordances) that depend on one's movement capabilities, and more specifically, the passability of a shrinking gap between converging obstacles. We introduce a new optical invariant that specifies in intrinsic units the minimum locomotor speed needed to safely pass through a shrinking gap. Detecting this information during self-motion requires recovering the component of the obstacles' local optical expansion attributable to obstacle motion, independent of self-motion. In principle, recovering the obstacle motion component could involve either visual or non-visual self-motion information. We investigated the visual and non-visual contributions in two experiments in which subjects walked through a virtual environment and made judgments about whether it was possible to pass through a shrinking gap. On a small percentage of trials, visual and non-visual self-motion information were independently manipulated by varying the speed with which subjects moved through the virtual environment. Comparisons of judgments on such catch trials with judgments on normal trials revealed both visual and non-visual contributions to the detection of information about minimum walking speed.},

abstract = {Emotional states of consciousness, or what are typically called emotional feelings, are traditionally viewed as being innately programmed in subcortical areas of the brain, and are often treated as different from cognitive states of consciousness, such as those related to the perception of external stimuli. We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain. In this view, what differs in emotional and nonemotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences. Although subcortical circuits are not di-rectly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide noncon-scious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences. In building the case for this proposal, we defend a modified version of what is known as the higher-order theory of consciousness. fear | amygdala | working memory | introspection | self M uch progress has been made in conceptualizing con-sciousness in recent years. This work has focused on the question of how we come to be aware of our sensory world, and has suggested that perceptual consciousness emerges via cognitive processing in cortical circuits that assemble conscious experiences in real-time. Emotional states of consciousness, on the other hand, have traditionally been viewed as involving innately programmed experiences that arise from subcortical circuits. Our thesis is that the brain mechanisms that give rise to con-scious emotional feelings are not fundamentally different from those that give rise to perceptual conscious experiences. Both, we propose, involve higher-order representations (HORs) of lower-order information by cortically based general networks of cog-nition (GNC). Thus, subcortical circuits are not responsible for feelings, but instead provide lower-order, nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences by cortical circuits (the distinction between cortical and subcortical circuits is de-fined in SI Appendix, Box 1). Our theory goes beyond traditional higher-order theory (HOT), arguing that self-centered higher-order states are essential for emotional experiences. Emotion, Consciousness, and the Brain Detailed understanding of the emotional brain, and theorizing about it, is largely based on studies that fall under the heading of " fear. " We will therefore focus on this body of work in discussing emotional consciousness. In light of this approach, we define " fear " as the conscious feeling one has when in danger. Although our conclusions may not apply equally well to all emotions, we maintain that the lessons from fear provide general principles that can at least be used as a starting point for theorizing about many emotions.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t A recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production, but also in its perception, i.e. that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social rela-tions between a group of real or virtual agents. While this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena, such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial beha-viour or between strong musical emotions and empathy, direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention. We created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of non-musical social intentions, such as being domineering, dis-dainful or conciliatory, to one another solely using musical interaction. Using a combination of decoding studies, computational and psychoacoustical analyses, we show that both musically-trained and non musically-trained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music, and that this social cog-nitive ability relies, to a sizeable extent, on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians' channels, but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction. By manipulating these cues in two-channel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of non-musician observers, we finally establish a causal relation-ship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand, and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination on the other hand. These results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions, but also into that of non-verbal interactions as a whole. {\'{O}} 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The relationship between team size and productivity is a question of broad relevance across economics, psychology, and management science. For complex tasks, however, where both the potential benefits and costs of coordinated work increase with the number of work- ers, neither theoretical arguments nor empirical evidence consistently favor larger vs. smaller teams. Experimental findings, meanwhile, have relied on small groups and highly stylized tasks, hence are hard to generalize to realistic settings. Here we narrow the gap between real-world task complexity and experimental control, reporting results from an online experiment in which 47 teams of size ranging from n = 1 to 32 collaborated on a real- istic crisis mapping task. Wefind that individuals in teams exerted lower overall effort than independent workers, in part by allocating their effort to less demanding (and less produc- tive) sub-tasks; however, we also find that individuals in teams collaborated more with increasing team size. Directly comparing these competing effects, we find that the largest teams outperformed an equivalent number of independent workers, suggesting that gains to collaboration dominated losses to effort. Importantly, these teams also performed compa- rably to a field deployment of crisismappers, suggesting that experiments of the type described here can help solve practical problems as well as advancing the science of col- lective intelligence.

abstract = {To explore the complexity of the game balance that gives rise to individual actions, the present study examined the multi-level nature of the game constraints that afford the action of a drive in basketball (dyadic attacker-defender versus inter-team relationships). On the basis of 33 play sequences including a drive, the positional data of the ten male professional basketball players were analyzed using an ecological dynamics approach. The results mainly revealed: a) that the pre-existing conditions that constrained the drives were only of inter-team level; the beginning of the action occurred after a lateral disturbance in the coordination between teams' geometrical centres combined with sustained lateral fluctuations in the stretch indices coordination; and b) the importance of time scale for observing these relevant fluctuations; we used 3-s, 1-s, and 0.5-s time intervals, but only the 0.5 time scale discriminated the significant variability differences. These results offer new insight into a team-oriented view of the game constraints that call for specific individual actions.},
annote = {the activity of a player at a given instant cannot be analysed without taking into account the other teammates and opponents who are acting at the same time.

Dyadic studies mainly describe how the ball-carrier's actions are constrained by the properties of his relationship with his immediate opponent.

In basketball, the attacker was specifically shown to drive to the basket when interpersonal distance and the defender-attacker-basket angle reached a critical value [1], with the direction of the drive being influenced by the defender's posture [11] (attackers performed more drives to the side of the most advanced foot of the defender)

Esteves et al. [10] revealed that the coordination tendencies changed according to the position of the attacker/defender dyad relative to the basket. 

Focus on the dyad:
With regard to the coaching process, these studies emphasise the properties of the attacker/defender coordination that coaches can manipulate or highlight in order to promote players' attunement to these properties so that they can better explore their possibilities for action.

the action of dribbling past the defender in a complex setting like a basketball game cannot be explained only on the basis of a dyadic relationship between ball-carrier and defender. An account of how the relationships with other teammates and opponents in space and time constrain the onset of the action is also needed.

In sum, the spatial-temporal relations between players that give rise to the attacker's action of a drive may be constrained not only by the immediate opponent, but also by the relationships developed with other teammates and opponents.

in a five-on-five basketball match, one assumes that the drive to the basket (i.e. dribbling to the scoring target) is not only constrained by the immediate defender but also depends on the space behind the defender being free.

Bourbousson et al. [2, 3] and in futsal by Travassos et al. [10], who observed that variability in playing dyads produced more stable and functional behaviours at a team level of analysis

We therefore measured the dynamics of the relationships between the attacking and defending players for each drive under analysis using: a) the dyadic level of constraints (i.e., attacker/defender interpersonal coordination); and b) the inter-team level of constraints (i.e., Team A/Team B interpersonal coordination).

We expected to capture fluctuations in the interpersonal patterns of coordination at different levels of team analysis that would support the action of a drive in basketball.

Predictions:
we expected the drive in basketball would be: a) preceded by a change in the attacker-defender interpersonal coordination (i.e., assumed to be the main game event constraining the ball-carrier), b) immediately followed by variability in the relationship between the two teams (i.e., assumed to be the main outcome).


DISCUSSION:

Our results of the dyadic analysis showed that the beginning of the drive was not preceded by a disturbance of the dyadic relationship between ball carrier and immediate defender (i.e., there was no significant differences in variability in the attacker/defender relative phase

However, fluctuations preceding the initiation of the drive were pointed out at a team level.},

TEAM COGNITION
shared cognition as an important requirement for effective team functioning (Cannon-Bowers, Salas, {\&} Converse, 1993; Mathieu, Heffner, Goodwin, Salas, {\&} Cannon-Bowers, 2000).

static knowl- edge structures and mental representations possessed by team members before their activity that facilitate team functioning.

as Gorman (2014) recently proposed, neglected to date has been a description of how team coordination is achieved in real-time via dynamic interactions between team members.

team member awareness, 
which refers generally to the situated cognitive activities of an actor involved in a dynamic situation (Cooke et al., 2013) and specifically to taking heed of what is going on in the current ongoing situation (Schmidt, 2002).

in many teams, multiple team members must maintain an awareness of changes in the current situation and their team members' behaviours in response to these changes so that they are able to dynamically and con- tinually coordinate their activities (Fiore {\&} Salas, 2004).

Furthermore, it is theorized that members of a team must hold in common or share an awareness of the current situation (De Jaegher {\&} Di Paolo, 2007). Shared aware- ness is defined as multiple team members each having at least a similar awareness of what is going on in the situation (Schmidt, 2002).

It is proposed that frameworks concerned with complexity and the nonlinear sciences are more appropriate for studying real-time team coordination (Ramos-Villagrasa, Navarro, {\&} Garcia-Izquierdo, 2012).

researchers have called for a rejection of the positivist paradigm (Arrow, McGrath, {\&} Berdahl, 2000), which has been criticized for a reductionist view, invol- ving directional causal inferences, of how team members coordinate (De Jaegher{\&}Di Paolo, 2007; Roe, Gockel,{\&} Meyer, 2012)

Instead, teams are considered the result of connections between team members and as dynamic sys- tems containing smaller systems (e.g., sub-groups of team members) embedded within different levels of organiza- tion and the naturalistic environment (Arrow et al., 2000).

Example: surgical team
do changes in team member awareness within small subsets of the team (e.g., a team member dyad) in response to a change in the current situation (e.g., patient deterioration in a surgical team) quickly lead to changes in awareness across the team more generally?

Awareness can be measured using social network analysis:


FIRST ISSUE: AN INTERNAL APPROACH OF SHARED AWARENESS

Traditionally, shared awareness has been studied from an “external” approach focused on the accuracy of team awareness (Saner, Bolstad, Gonzalez, {\&} Cuevas, 2009),

where accuracy refers to whether the content of what is shared within the team accurately reflects the situation encountered.

How is situation awareness lost?, how can the loss be minimised? (Endsley {\&} Kiris, 1995).

Shift in focus to an internal view of shared awareness, "the undertsnading each team member develops about the other team members and the dynamic reorganisation do the connections between team members during performance"


how do team members connect to ensure eachteam member keeps track of changes in the team'scourse of action in response to ongoing changes in task demands;

what forms of connection within the team immediately precede coordination breakdowns; and 

how have highly effective teams learned to connect efficiently and competently?

Need to use 
Schmidt's(2002; Heath, Svensson, Hindmarsh, Luff, {\&} vom Lehn, 2002) perspective on awareness (Uitdewilligen et al., 2010), which is that awareness, as experienced by an actor, is embedded in connections that are built and broken with operators involved in the cooperative effort.

SECOND ISSUE: MODELING SHAREDNESS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION

Subset level connections (level 1), and how these connections influence and are influenced by patterns of connections across team more generally (level 2)

The approach also enabled us to explore whether we could describe the overall pattern of the team's awareness with reference to a model of shared awareness.},

State of the art object tracking systems now produce spatio-temporal traces of player trajectories with high definition and high frequency, and this, in turn, has facilitated a variety of research efforts, across many disciplines, to extract insight from the trajectories. We survey recent research efforts that use spatio-temporal data from team sports as input, and involve non-trivial computation. This article categorises the research efforts in a coherent framework and identifies a number of open research questions.},

abstract = {Everyday human actions often occur in a social context. Past psychological research has found that the motor behavior of socially situated in- dividuals tends to be coordinated. Our research performed over the last 20 years has sought to understand how the mutuality, accommodation, and synchrony found in everyday interactional coordination can be understood using a dynamical theory of behavioral order, namely coordination dynamics. Using laboratory interpersonal tasks, we have demonstrated that when two people are asked to rhythmically co- ordinate their limbs they show behavioral phenomena identical to those found in bimanual interlimb coordination, which has been mathematically modeled as a dy- namical process. Research has demonstrated that these same dynamical organizing principles can coordinate the rhythmic movements of two people unintentionally and that the weaker, intermittent coordination that ensues is affected by both perceptual (e.g., attentional focus and information pickup activity of the visual system) and dynamical constraints (e.g., intrapersonal rhythmic synergies and period basin of entrainment). Other research has investigated how traditional social and personal- ity properties of a dyad (rapport, social competence) relate to dynamical properties of a dyad's coordinated movements and how the stability of coordinated movements mirrors the stability of mental connectedness experienced in social interactions. 1},

abstract = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics. They are part of the core knowledge expected of any applied statistician. Linear models are the foundation of a broad range of statistical methodologies; this book is a survey of techniques that grow from a linear model. Our starting point is the regression model with response y and predictors x1,...xp. The model takes the form: y=$\beta$0+$\beta$1x1+...+$\beta$pxp+$\epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed. This book presents three extensions to this framework. The first generalizes the y part; the second, the $\epsilon$ part; and the third, the x part of the linear model. Generalized Linear Models: The standard linear model cannot handle nonnormal responses, y, such as counts or proportions. This motivates the development of generalized linear models that can represent categorical, binary and other response types. Mixed Effect Models: Some data has a grouped, nested or hierarchical structure. Repeated measures, longitudinal and multilevel data consist of several observations taken on the same individual or group. This induces a correlation structure in the error, $\epsilon$. Mixed effect models allow the modeling of such data. Nonparametric Regression Models: In the linear model, the predictors, x, are combined in a linear way to model the effect on the response. Sometimes this linearity is insufficient to capture the structure of the data and more flexibility is required. Methods such as additive models, trees and neural networks allow a more flexible regression modeling of the response that combine the predictors in a nonparametric manner. This book aims to provide the reader with a well-stocked toolbox of statistical methodologies. A practicing statistician needs to be aware of and familiar with the basic use of a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book will be a success if the reader is able to recognize and get started on a wide range of problems. However, the breadth comes at the expense of some depth. Fortunately, there are book-length treatments of topics discussed in every chapter of this book, so the reader will know where to go next if needed. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It runs on a wide variety of platforms including the Windows, Linux and Macintosh operating systems. Although there are several excellent statistical packages, only R is both free and possesses the power to perform the analyses demonstrated in this book. While it is possible in principle to learn statistical methods from purely theoretical expositions, I believe most readers learn best from the demonstrated interplay of theory and practice. The data analysis of real examples is woven into this book and all the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses are provided.},

annote = {Overall Takeaway: there needs to be a physical experience of the intended action in order to reduce uncertainty

performances and affordances in the experimental condition in which this "experience" was induced were significantly higher than in the non-experience and control.


This evidence suggests the ability to establish an efficient shared representation of a joint action benefits from physically taking our partner's perspective because simply observing the actions of others may not be enough.


Social interactions require dynamic and efficient encoding of others' gesture and a spatiotemporal synchronization of the individuals involved (Sebanz et al., 2006).

Coordination Dynamics have explored the social influence of one person on another, highlighting a spontaneous and immediate coordination of their actions while engaging in interpersonal sensorimotor interactions (see Coey et al., 2012 for a review)

This theory places social cognition in an embodied-embedded constraint, where social behavior is defined as self-organized.

Cognitivist:

Evidence indicating that action production and action perception rely on common mechanisms led to the Theory of Event Coding (Hommel et al., 2001). If perception and action rely on common codes, it makes the integration of one's own and co-actor's action for joint actions relatively straightforward (bottom-up processes).

On a more top-down perceptive, co-representation of conspecifics during joint action is thought to be a key feature to understanding others' goals and actions (Sebanz et al., 2006).

Mirror Neurons System (MNS):
automatically firing during the execution of an action and the observation of the same action performed by another person

neural processes during interpersonal motor interactions:
the recruitment of fronto-parietal networks during interactive contexts where MN are thought to play a role in the internal simulation, action prediction and understanding. 

However, interpersonal coordination requires both perception and understanding of our partner's movements while controlling our own movements.

Hari and Kujala (2009) proposed the “interactive- loop” model. This model is that a coupling of perceptive and motor systems of the individuals is necessarily involved during joint actions in order to form common internal representations.

The progressive construction of these “action-perception” loops is constantly changing and seems to be essential for encoding social actions and building up a common representation of the action for all the protagonists involved (Hari and Kujala, 2009)

We attempted to reveal a behavioral change (placing the base in a more optimal position) when both individuals had physically experienced the other partner's motor task difficulty. 

We wish to point out a limit of the maximalist interpretations of the MNS, according to which this system serves the understanding

Although we agree the MNS is part of basic constituents of action understanding, this system appeared not sufficient to fully understand actions and apprehend movement difficulties encountered by the other.

Experimental task:
The subjects were asked to carry out a simple task: S1 was to move the base to the center of the table and S2 was to place the parallelepiped in the slot on the base. Note that the action performed by S2 is more or less facilitated depending on how S1 place the base on the table: difficult when the slot in the base remains parallel to the sagittal axis; easy when it is slightly tilted to the left.

In Condition 1, the joint action was repeated 20 times with no other instruction other than completing the task after a vocal “Go” signal from the experimenter, which was the same for every trial. 

In Condition 2, subject's roles were interchanged so S1 was in charge of moving the parallelepiped and S2 the base for 3 trials. (Because this second condition was designed to give the opportunity for participants to experience the other's action, data from Condition 2 was not analyzed).

In Condition 3, subjects reverted to their initial roles (so they were carrying out the same task as in Condition 1) for another 20 trials.

In this final condition, participants were further instructed to perform the task as fast as possible. During the whole experiment, participants were not allowed to communicate their feelings either verbally or by explicit non-verbal utterance.

Control Experiment
COmplete condition 3 of main experiment: A critical point of the Control experiment was that participants were only assigned to one role; they did not have the opportunity to experience the other participant's task

Results:
The results revealed better performance (execution time and velocity) in both sub-movements of the task, Reach-to-Grasp and Displace, for both participants when common representation of the task was achieved.

measurements also highlight a significant change in
the final angle of the cylindrical base between the Condition 1 (before the subjects switched roles) and Condition 3 (after the subjects switched their roles). According to Allami et al. (2008), this orientation's change from the sagittal axis facilitates the partner Displace sub-movement: the articular tension in the arm and wrist joints are less extreme in Condition 3 than in Condition 1.

indicates that the participant placing the base changed their previous behavior, after experiencing the partner's contribution to the joint action.


Discussion:
We can agree here that MN were certainly activated to understand globally the action but not the subtleties such as extreme joint angles. The critical behavioral change only appeared in Condition 3, when both subjects shared a common knowledge of the two individual actions composing the joint action. 

It still remains unclear whether the processing of relevant information during joint actions emerges from the physical and informational constraints (Rigoli et al., 2015) or whether it is supported by high-level representations (social-specific) mechanisms (Sebanz et al., 2006) or through lower perceptive mechanisms (Dolk et al., 2011). In other words, is the mental representation of a partner necessary, and if it is, to what extent does one interacting individual need to mentally represent the actions of others to interact with them? 

The findings of our experiment seem to be contesting the latter theories (both Theory of Event Coding and Coordination Dynamics), rather they agree that the common representation of the action during social interaction is through mental representation.

Our results appear to have a better fit in a top-down explanation: our behavioral change did not appear automatically through action observation nor motor coordination between subjects but only when knowledge of task-specific features was shared between the two participants.},

annote = {(1) that coordination, and not just synchrony, can have pro-social consequences (if the task is social)

(2) that the effects of intentional coordination are direct, not mediated

(3) that the degree of the coordination did not predict the degree of cooperation (are we talking about cost or consequentiality here?)

what it is about these Coordinated Rhythmic Movement (CRM) tasks that makes people more cooperative:


PARAMETERS:
1) +/- (S)ynchrony of coordination
2) +/- (D)irect effect of coordination on cooperation
3) +/- (P)roportion of coordination at the individual level

2) Is the cooperation effect mediated by some other factor, like group cohesion

3) whether there is a linear relationship between coordination and cooperation at the level of individual participants, or whether pro-social benefits obtain (and then remain more or less constant) after a certain threshold in coordination is reached.


Complicated rhythmic coordination movement requires extensive training. 

Are the cooperation effects simply due to in-phase synchrony or something more general?

Two possible mediators of CRM (coordination) on cooperation:
—group cohesion and self-other-overlap

Group cohesion is the feeling of being on the same team and being emotionally connected with other group members.

Reddish et al. (2013) grouped 
-emotional connection, 
-trust and 
-self/other overlap (the extent of self-rated overlap between oneself and others) into a single construct,whichwas termed group cohesion

.Wiltermuth (2012), on the other hand, measured group integrators only (i.e., perceived closeness, connectedness and similarity to the group) and labeled the construct emotional connection

Others have investigated self-other-overlap as a potential mediator of the relationship between coordination and cooperation;

Lumsden et al. (2014) and Reddish et al. (2013) found evidence,
Reddish et al. (2014) found no evidence for such a relationship.


There is considerable evidence that some kind of social context is an important element to obtain positive social effects following coordination tasks (Hove and Risen, 2009; Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009; Wu et al., 2013; Launay et al., 2014), however, questions remain about how much social context is necessary and whether this relationship is one of mediation or moderation

The studies reported below provide the strongest evidence to date for D+ vs. D− models by testing a variety of potential mediators (i.e., group cohesion, self-other overlap, trust, self-rated success at coordination, self-rated task difficulty, task difficulty, and mood) within subjects at both pre- and post-coordination.

On the one hand, there is evidence that tightness in movement coupling predicts likability between co-actors (Hove and Risen, 2009). On the other hand, coordination success is not a good predictor of post-task trust (Launay et al., 2013).

testing whether individual level success at coordination predicts subsequent individual level cooperation behavior.


CRM Tasks: perception -action tasks
They involve the continuous control and matching of rhythmic movements via perceptual information about the coordination between those movements.

The basic phenomena of a CRM task are that movements are stable at in- and anti-phase

RESULTS:

Cooperation (PGG ): 
Univariate ANOVA significant effect of phase on the mean public account donation, owing to a significant difference between in-phase and control conditions.

Trust {\&} Reciprocity (Investment game): no significant results found

Mediators:
Group Cohesion: no effect
Self-Other Overlap: no effect

Coordination on Cooperation? No effect of coordination scores (measurements from the coordination tasks) on cooperation.

MVL scores did not significantly predict cooperation, which suggests that the social effects seen post-entrainment do not vary linearly at an individual level with coordination. This is consistent with Kirschner and Ilari (2014) and Launay et al. (2013) and rules in favor of P- stylemodels.

Further analyses of the proportion-time-on-target scores revealed that those who were instructed to move in-phase were more successful than those that were instructed to move anti-phase

A pair's coordination score did not significantly predict a pair's average cooperation
score

Cohesion / Self-Other Overlap:

The finding that increases in group cohesion do not mediate these effects supports the work of Dong et al. (2015), Lumsden et al. (2014), and Reddish et al. (2014). However, it did not support the work of Reddish et al. (2013), Wiltermuth and Heath (2009), and Wiltermuth (2012), which found that cohesion partially mediates the relationship between CRM and its social consequences.

They provide evidence that, only when a coordination is relatively easy to perform can we attend to the social nature of the task, which is crucial to the pro-social consequences which follow. Anti-phase coordination is known to be harder andmore demanding than in-phase (Kelso, 1995), as was supported by the proportion-time-on-target results in this Experiment (See Figure

FOLLOW UP 1: adding in social information via a mirror

Results:
There was no main effect of either Coordination Information or Movement Phase (p's {\textgreater} 0.05). However, there was a significant interaction between the phase people moved at and the information they used to
coordinate theirmovements [F(1, 84) =4.18, p{\textless}0.05, N2 =0.04]. Peoplewho coordinated anti-phase via amirror cooperatedmore than people who coordinated anti-phase via PLDs.

No mediation by Cohesion / Self Other Overlap

Participants coordinating at anti-phase were more cooperative if they coordinated via direct visual information of their partner's movements rather than via PLDs.


This supports the claimof Kokal et al. (2011) that the social nature of the task is an important element inwhy CRMhas pro-social consequences (supporting a D−model), which can be obscured in more demanding tasks. This suggests that both in- and anti-phase movements are capable of affecting cooperation under the right circumstances, favoring a S−model.

Coordination scores (proportion-time-spent-on-target) again did not significantly predict cooperation scores (supporting a P− model). There is still no evidence that coordination success is driving CRM's effect on cooperation, replicating the result from Experiment 1 and supporting work by Kirschner and Ilari (2014) and Launay et al. (2013).

FOLLOW UP 2: Coordination more generally (same

Movement Type [F(2, 63) =5.69, p{\textless}0.01 N2 =0.15]. Bonferroni post-hoc tests indicated that those who moved In-phase (M =
6.19, SD = 2.24) showed more post-coordination cooperation than those in the Control (M = 4.2, SD = 2.81, p {\textless} 0.05).

Those in the Coordinated condition (M=6.72, SD=2.74) also showed more cooperation than those in theControl (p{\textless}0.01)

The results of this follow up show that similar levels of cooperation are seen after coordinating different movements to a common frequency as are seen after in-phase coordination, despite levels of actual coordination being significantly lower.

These results suggest that people do not need to perform the same type of movements for coordination to have cooperative social consequences and emphasize again that tightness of coordination is not directly linked to the magnitude of cooperation (P− model)

The important factor appears to be that they coordinate to a common rhythm.

This, along with the other findings reported in this paper, suggests that it is not moving at some particular phase, or a given tightness in couplingwhich fosters cooperation. Rather, the crucial factor appears to be just intentionallymoving in timewith somebody in a clearly social context, regardless of whether the same movements are performed or whether there is a specific phase locking.},

annote = {In research that has considered collective behavior as emerging from a self-organized complex system, an important focus has been on the between-agents' interactions, supported by an informational flow that binds agents (e.g., Schmidt et al., 1990)

In this stream of research, information is defined as an ambient energy that disturbs the agent, depending on his current activity (Varela et al., 1991). From the (interpersonal) informational flow, individual activities can be entrained, mutually affected by others' movements, so that the emerging collective behavior cannot be conceived out of either the nature or the content (i.e., being non-representational) of such a flow (e.g., Kelso, 1994; Lagarde and Kelso, 2006; Richardson et al., 2007).

However, while between-agents informational flow has been considered the main binding mechanism that makes collective behavior emerge, we aim at pointing out that the way individuals manage their interaction in the real-time mainly has been theoretically presupposed rather than empirically investigated.

HYPOTHESIS 1: A COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR EMERGES FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES BEING LOCALLY COUPLED

the assumption that global collective patterns observable at the social system level of organization come from indivisible interpersonal dynamical couplings at a lower level of organization, also called local couplings

The emergence principle accounts for the process by which local couplings give rise to a higher order identifiable pattern, the so-called collective behavior.

The emergence principle accounts for the process by which local couplings give rise to a higher order identifiable pattern, the so-called collective behavior.

Conversely, the downward causation principle accounts for the process by which the global patterned behavior constrains the way in which individual agents behave and interact at the local level of organization, without these agents necessarily being aware of such a descending causality.

According to the principle of parsimony of scientific explanations, and largely inspired by swarming intelligence theorizations, this local couplings hypothesis has been very successful in explaining from simple mechanisms how complex social systems behaviors can emerge from simple local rules of interaction.

HYPOTHESIS 2: EMERGENT COLLECTIVE BEHAVIORS ARE SUPPORTED BY A PROCESS OF≪CO-REGULATION≫AT THE LEVEL OF THE LOCAL COUPLINGS

collective behavior is captured through the identification of non-accidental patterns of individual behaviors, as observed at the global scale.

However, an identifiable patterned behavioral co-ordination is not enough to consider that a collective behavior has emerged from interaction of its constituent individual parts; it also is required that the given interactors actively regulate the interpersonal co-ordination dynamics at the level of their local couplings. 

an informational flow must have occurred between them, and this flow must be dynamically managed. 

De Jaegher and Di Paolo (2007) stated that complex phenomena of emergence are facilitated when both interactors simultaneously regulate their ongoing interpersonal co-ordination (i.e., a bi-directional flow of interplay), making the collective behavior achieved escape from any individual perspective of the interactors implied.

the collective behavior can express all the marks of complexity and meta-stability needed to consider the social system as exhibiting self-sustained dynamical behaviors. The need for such a mutuality in the interaction fit under the theme of co- regulation requirement, also discussed as a mutual awareness requirement in other research traditions (Fiore and Salas, 2004).

Interestingly, what helps participants to succeed in finding each other, and subsequently to experience social connectedness, is the occurring co-regulation process they both perceived simultaneously at some instances (Froese et al., 2014a,b), regardless of the extent to which each actor was satisfied by the unfolding interaction, since they were not informed of their current effectiveness in the task.

In agreement with the co-regulation requirement for interpersonal co-ordination emergence, most of the studies testing this regulation process have been experimental and have focused on the co-ordination within dyads, providing reiterated evidence of the interpersonal benefits related to co-regulation processes (Schmidt and Richardson, 2008)

PERPLEXING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE 1: SOCIAL SYSTEMS DO NOT NEED CO-REGULATION TO PERFORM

While the hypothesis of a co-regulation requirement has been pervasive in interpersonal co-ordination research, some empirical studies have found it hard to observe in naturalistic empirical data, especially in goal-directed collective behaviors. 

Bourbousson and colleagues investigated how agents heeded their co-agents in the study of basketball teams performing in their natural social competitive context (Bourbousson et al., 2015). The authors examined mutual adjustments at the level of the activity that was meaningful for the interactors, and compared novice and expert teams

Teams were considered dynamic social networks, with team members as nodes and members' awareness of other members during ongoing performance as relations.

Networks, and changes to them across games, were analyzed at different levels of organization, using social network analysis to identify patterns of co-regulation within the teams.

Results showed that that the reciprocity index, accounting for the instantaneous co-regulation occurring within all the considered dyads within the teams, was significantly lower than expected by chance when considering expert team co-ordination, but was not the case in novice team co-ordination. 

Moreover, the observed low co-regulation was very stable over time, so that the proposed intra-team patterns of regulation had all the marks of expertise.

Other studies have reported similar observations in various field of team co-ordination, as in civilian command, control, and communication settings (Wellens and Ergener, 1988), socio-technical collaborative systems (Salmon et al., 2008), or various settings of cognitive engineering research (Cooke et al., 2009).

Together, these studies suggested an enhanced capability of expert social systems to achieve and maintain an optimal level of awareness during the unfolding activity, with this level of awareness being lower than in novice social systems.

it appeared reasonable to the authors to
consider that interactors' activities of regulation directed toward co-agents become parsimonious through practice and expertise enhancement, possibly enabled by a gradual establishment of implicit co-ordination processes (Bourbousson et al., 2015).

Implicit co-ordination processes mean that interactors co-ordinate by drawing on accurate expectations of future intra-team events

These expectations are developed and shared by interactors through extensive shared practice prior to their current activity (Eccles, 2010; Gorman, 2014).

It appears that whatever the nature of the process involved, expert interactors probably do not need to pay as much attention to their co-agents during ongoing task performance, as a result of their shared experiences.

The co-regulation hypothesis is thus quite unsatisfactory, at least as a strong interaction requirement in goal-directed social systems that are composed of many inter-related dyads, and in which the shared experience of interactors allows them to adopt a parsimonious but effective structure of regulation of the intra-teamco-ordination.

PERPLEXING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE 2: HUMAN AGENTS CAN GRASP THE GLOBAL PICTURE THEY HELP TO MAKE EMERGE

Most complex-systems-inspired frameworks of interpersonal co-ordination have thus subsequently considered that local couplings were enough to conceptualize collective behaviors, that these local couplings signed a parsimonious way of structuring informational flows within the social
system, system, and that such a process was a perfect example of the emergence phenomenon.

HOLIPTISM:

However, unlike the research on social insects, that on interpersonal co-ordination has neglected to consider that human co-agents are capable of grasping the global picture they help to make emerge, especially in cases in which collective behavior is goal-directed and actively regulated by co-agents. (This brings to mind Tomasello)

In this way, the collective behavior in which individuals are involved may directly support their adaptive activity and thus be considered as a non-negligible informational constraint that supports humans' goal-directed behavior. This capability has been called holoptism, that is the ability for any interacting co-agent to perceive the dynamics of the whole interactive system (Noubel, 2004; Bauwens, 2005)


For instance, sport coaches are well aware of such a
capability for holoptism in humans: When players are called to perceive the rhythm of the game, free spaces, or team fluidity of movements, the given agents thus couple to high- order spatiotemporal information that probably helps them to better couple locally1
but this information does not rely per se at the local coupling level itself (see Bourbousson et al., 2014 for an empirical research).

While the local couplings hypothesis is very useful in
swarming behaviors theories, our opinion is that current interpersonal co-ordination theories in humans run the risk of not being cautious enough when introducing the local couplings hypothesis as a starting point of the research (e.g., Silva et al., 2014). 

One can note that most of the experimental study designs have invited participants to adjust to a single co-agent, but this individual dyad level of investigation does not clearly distinguish local and global scales of the collective behavior (e.g., Schmidt and Richardson, 2008)

our opinion is that one approach to further investigate what holoptism may bring to interpersonal co- ordination theories might be to extend the number of co- agents implied in the collective behavior under study to better allow for the distinction between the levels of organization that shape the social system's dynamics.

BREAKING THE DEADLOCK: CONSIDERING THAT THE NUMBER OF CO-AGENTS MATTERS IN THEORIZING SOCIAL SYSTEMS FUNCTIONING

very few studies investigated how people actively are involved in regulating their interpersonal co-ordination states in the real-time.

When this active regulation was discussed in the research, it was often considered a theoretical assumption related to the nature of the informational flow binding actors, rather than being empirically investigated and described.

challenged two theoretical hypotheses, the co-regulation and the local couplings hypotheses, respectively. Our opinion is that both have been overlooked, probably due to a common property of the existing study designs: The number of co-agents implied in the experimental paradigms was quite small (i.e., two interacting agents;Alderisio et al., 2016). Studying dyads may have limited our fundamental understanding of how collective behaviors emerge from interacting individual activities. Empirical and theoretical benefits should thus come from studying operating social system larger than a dyad, especially by revising the co-regulation and the local couplings hypotheses.

the topic of co-agents' number was not discussed
enough in human behavior science, but a few examples may be found in numerical science, especially in human crowd modeling, that explain how human collective systems can exhibit adjustment mechanisms that change, and are very dependent on the number of co-agents (Mehran et al., 2009)

Some examples can also be found in the study of financial market fluctuations where interactions between agents are considered a variable (e.g., Lux andMarchesi, 1999), expressed not as a linear function of the investors' number but rather as subjected to a threshold effect that makes social contagion more or less pronounced (e.g., Orl{\'{e}}an, 1990)

Specificity of human collective behaviors often relies on interpersonal co-ordination being itself the goal to achieve, implying that co-agents interact to actively create/maintain/disrupt global interpersonal states of behavior, and, in some instances, these states are probably managed through holoptism capability.

Empirical studies that investigate effects of the social system's size on the collective behavior of humans who are actively regulating their online states of co-ordination will contribute to an opened avenue of research on the topic of interpersonal co-ordination dynamics.

Unanswered questions thus would need to be addressed, like knowing howmanymembers implied in the social systemmight require or prevent occurrences of holoptism or one-sided co- ordination processes


PERSPECTIVES:
How can informational flows be patterned in goal-directed social systems larger than dyads?

Basketball:
5-member social system, each member must regulate four co-ordination links at once

which makes the attentional requirement of the task very hard to manage, 

and even harder in a 10-member social systeminwhich 45 co-ordination links have to be simultaneously co-regulated, and so on.

To counter-balance the co-regulation hypothesis, it is probable that co-regulation can occur only between certain co-agents, and the overall social systemfunctions through few co-ordination links (i.e., low density within the network of informational flows

It is also likely that the coupling linkages do not necessarily need to be reciprocal between the co-agents, so that one-sided co-ordination should provide benefits to the global efficiency and parsimony of the system. (For example, leadership.)

It is even more likely that co-agents can face the difficulty of regulating each local coupling by grasping the overall picture at some point in their activity (i.e., global matching capabilities), thus counter-balancing the local couplings hypothesis.

does structural congruence betweenmembers, as achieved through recurrent interactions in team training (Maturana and Varela, 1987), help them to pay less (reciprocal) attention to the regulation of their couplings?

Do some properties of interpersonal networks allow for a lessened need of agents' co-regulation, due to a somewhat ‘less effort for more effects' phenomenon, such as might be hypothesized in wide networks? 

To which extent does holoptism capability help to better explain the emergence of non-goal- directed (i.e., unintentional) patterns of collective behavior?},

abstract = {What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environ-ment we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10{\%} and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70{\%} com-pared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13{\%} of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here. sustainable diets | dietary change | food system | health analysis | greenhouse gas emissions T he choices we make about the food we eat affect our health and have major ramifications for the state of the environment. The food system is responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (1), of which up to 80{\%} are associated with livestock production (2, 3). The aggregate dietary decisions we make thus have a large influence on climate change. High consumption of red and processed meat and low consump-tion of fruits and vegetables are important diet-related risk factors contributing to substantial early mortality in most regions while over a billion people are overweight or obese (4). Without targeted dietary changes, the situation is expected to worsen as a growing and more wealthy global population adopts diets resulting in more GHG emissions (5) and that increase the health burden from chronic, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) associated with high body weight and unhealthy diets (6). Recent analyses have highlighted the environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets and have also suggested that such dietary changes could lead to improved health (7–14). They have shown that reductions in meat con-sumption and other dietary changes would ease pressure on land use (11, 12) and reduce GHG emissions (7, 11–14). Changing diets may be more effective than technological mitigation options for avoiding climate change (14) and may be essential to avoid nega-tive environmental impacts such as major agricultural expansion (7) and global warming of more than 2 °C (13) while ensuring access to safe and affordable food for an increasing global pop-ulation (8, 15). The diets investigated in these studies include diets with a pro rata reduction in animal products (ruminant meat, total meat, dairy) (11, 13, 14), specific dietary patterns that include reduced or no meat (such as Mediterranean, " pescatarian, " and vegetarian diets) (11, 12), and diets based on recommendations about healthy eating (7, 11). The health consequences of adopting these diets have not been explicitly modeled or quantitatively analyzed, but instead inferences have been drawn from information available in the epidemiological literature (16). In the most comprehensive study to date, Tilman and Clark (12) analyzed the GHG emissions of a series of diets that differed in their animal-sourced food con-tent and presented their results alongside a series of observational studies of the health consequences of adopting the different diets. Here, we use a region-specific global health model to link the health and environmental consequences of changing diets. We also make a first attempt, to our knowledge, to estimate the economic value of different dietary choices through their effects on health and the environment. For the health analysis, we built a compar-ative risk assessment model to estimate age and region-specific mortality associated with changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors (4, 17). The specific risk factors influence mortality through dose–response relationships, which allow us to compare different dietary scenarios based on their exposure to those risk factors. Given the availability of consistent epidemiological data, we fo-cused on changes in the consumption of red meat, and of fruits and vegetables, which together accounted for more than half of diet-related deaths in 2010 (4), and also on the fraction of people who are overweight or obese through excess calorie consumption, which too is associated strongly with chronic disease mortality (18, 19).},

Previous research indicates that rhythm, an essential feature of music, can enhance coor- dination of movement and increase social bonding. However, the prolonged effects of rhythm have not yet been investigated. In this study, pairs of participants were exposed to one of three kinds of auditory stimuli (rhythmic, arrhythmic, or white-noise) and subsequently engaged in five trials of a joint-action task demanding interpersonal coordination. We show that when compared with the other two stimuli, exposure to the rhythmic beat reduced the practice effect in task performance. Analysis of the behavioral data suggests that this reduction results from more temporally coupled motor movements over successive trials and that shared exposure to rhythm facilitates interper- sonal motor coupling, which in this context serves to impede the attainment of necessary dynamic coordination. We propose that rhythm has the potential to enhance interpersonal motor coupling, which might serve as a mechanism behind its facilitation of positive social attitudes.},

The intersection of the two—which we term “parochial altruism”—is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain by eschewing these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts. Our game-theoretic analysis and agent-based simulations show that under conditions likely to have been experienced by late Pleistocene and early Holocene humans, neither parochialism nor altruism would have been viable singly, but by promoting group conflict, they could have evolved jointly.

According to the social control hypothesis, human sacrifice legitimizes political authority and social class systems, functioning to stabilize such social stratification. Support for the social control hypothesis is largely limited to historical anecdotes of human sacrifice, where the causal claims have not been subject to rigorous quantitative cross-cultural tests. Here we test the social control hypothesis by applying Bayesian phylogenetic methods to a geographically and socially diverse sample of 93 traditional Austronesian cultures. We find strong support for models in which human sacrifice stabilizes social stratification once stratification has arisen, and promotes a shift to strictly inherited class systems. Whilst evolutionary theories of religion have focused on the functionality of prosocial and moral beliefs, our results reveal a darker link between religion and the evolution of modern hierarchical societies.},

abstract = {Cooperation is central to human social behaviour. However, choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal cost to benefit others. Here we explore the cognitive basis of cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process framework. We ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness, behaving cooperatively only through active self-control; or whether they are intuitively cooperative, with reflection and prospective reasoning favouring 'rational' self-interest. To investigate this issue, we perform ten studies using economic games. We find that across a range of experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection. To explain these results, we propose that cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is typically advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this proposed mechanism. Our results provide convergent evidence that intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas, and that reflection can undermine these cooperative impulses.},

abstract = {Human attachment behavior mediates establishment and maintenance of social relationships. Adult attachment characteristically varies on anxiety and avoidance dimensions, reflecting the tendencies to worry about the partner breaking the social bond (anxiety) and feeling uncomfortable about depending on others (avoidance). In primates and other mammals, the endogenous $\mu$-opioid system is linked to long-term social bonding, but evidence of its role in human adult attachment remains more limited. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to reveal how variability in $\mu$-opioid receptor (MOR) availability is associated with adult attachment in humans. We scanned 49 healthy subjects using a MOR-specific ligand [(11) C]carfentanil and measured their attachment avoidance and anxiety with the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised scale. The avoidance dimension of attachment correlated negatively with MOR availability in the thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the frontal cortex, amygdala, and insula. No associations were observed between MOR availability and the anxiety dimension of attachment. Our results suggest that the endogenous opioid system may underlie interindividual differences in avoidant attachment style in human adults, and that differences in MOR availability are associated with the individuals' social relationships and psychosocial well-being.

However, we often lack systematic information about the productivity of past agricultural systems on a large enough scale in order to be able to test these theories properly. The effect of climate on crop yields has received a great deal of attention resulting in a range of empirical and process-based models, yet the focus has primarily been on current or future conditions. In this paper, we argue for a “bottom-up” approach that estimates productivity, or potential productivity based on information about the agricultural practices and technologies used in past societies. Of key theoretical interest is using this information to estimate the carrying capacity of a given region, independently of estimates of population size. We outline how explicit crop yield models can be combined with high quality historical and archaeological information about past societies, in order to infer the temporal and geographic patterns of change in agricultural productivity and potential. We discuss the kinds of information we need to collect about agricultural techniques and practices in the past, and introduce a new databank initiative we have developed for collating the best available historical and archaeological evidence. A key benefit of our approach lies in making explicit the steps in the process of estimating past productivities and carrying capacities, and in being able to assess the effects of different modelling assumptions. This is undoubtedly an ambitious task, yet promises to provide important insights into fundamental aspects of past societies, and will enable us to test more rigorously key hypotheses about human socio-cultural evolution.},

abstract = {Imitation and innovation work in tandem to support cultural learning in children and facilitate our capacity for cumulative culture. Here we propose an integrated theoretical account of how the unique demands of acquiring instrumental skills and cultural conventions provide insight into when children imitate, when they innovate, and to what degree. For instrumental learning, with an increase in experience, high fidelity imitation decreases and innovation increases. By contrast, for conventional learning, imitative fidelity stays high, regardless of experience, and innovation stays low. We synthesize cutting edge research on the development of imitative flexibility and innovation to provide insight into the social learning mechanisms underpinning the uniquely human mind.},
annote = {The technological advances that charac- terize humans are an outcome of our species' remarkable capacity for cumulative culture; innovations build on each other and are progressively incorporated into a population's stock of skills and knowledge, generating ever more sophisticated repertoires

Cumulative culture requires the high fidelity transmission of group-specific instrumental skills (see Glossary) and social conventions to future generations

Instrumental skills are the technological toolkits of social groups. They allow group members to perform the types of tasks required for survival and success within particular cultural contexts.

Social conventions are group-specific practices that function to increase cohesion and cooperation among group members.

Although the functions of instrumental skills and social conventions are distinct, in practice, all behavior is embedded within social contexts and frequently has both instrumental and conventional elements. 

overimitation or copying actions that are causally irrelevant to achieving an instrumental end goal

the transmission of cumulative culture across generations can be seen, in part, as a byproduct of our propensity for high fidelity imitation.

Yet, imitation alone does not explain the extraordinary cultural achievements of our species. Innovation is necessary to ensure cultural and individual adaptation to novel and changing ecological challenges over time.

By 2 years of age, the tendency to overimitate has become so ubiquitous that children will even imitate causally irrelevant actions that they know are unnecessary to achieving an instrumental end goal

Some propose that overimitation is an adaptive human strategy facilitating more rapid social learning of instrumental skills than would be possible if copying required a full representation of the causal structure of an event [10,22].

rational action theory of imitation [23,24]. According to this theory, ostensive communi- cation or ‘natural pedagogy' (i.e., evolved interpretive biases that allow and foster the transmission of generic and culturally shared knowledge to others) coupled with a ‘teleological stance' (i.e., reasoning that is based on the assumption of purpose, design, or function) enables young children to represent the structure of novel actions even when the causal relations between the method and the outcome are opaque and appear to violate the expectation for behavioral efficiency derived from the principle of rationality

In line with a ‘copy-when-uncertain' social learning strategy [26], overimitation may be so adaptive that it is employed at the expense of efficiency [27]. That is, the costs of not imitating with high fidelity in an uncertain situation outweigh the benefits of the reduced effort entailed in imitating with low fidelity

This approach to social learning likely had its foundation in our Pleistocene past [28]. As proponents of dual inheritance theory maintain, unless the world is at least somewhat uncertain (or opaque), natural selection would not favor high fidelity imitation [29].

Contemporary research on imitation in early childhood has been heavily influenced by research in comparative psychology:

Despite substantial psychological evidence for the early developing and sophisticated capacity to reason causally [37], much of what children need to learn and interpret is not based on understanding physical causality and instead is based on social conventionality.

The rituals that children must learn to become competent members of their cultural communities are socially stipulated group conventions, uninterpretable from the perspective of physical causality [40].

We propose that rituals are a crucial subset of conventional behavior with distinctively social functions [14]. They lack an intuitive or observable causal connection between the specific action performed (e.g., ceremonial dance) and the desired outcome or effect (e.g., making it rain) [41,130].

The social stipulation and causal opacity of rituals make them ideally suited to high fidelity cultural transmission, reinforced by a willingness to rely on faith in cultural traditions over personal experience or intuition [14–17].

New research indicates that high fidelity imitation may have evolved social functions, notably encoding normative behavior [45–47], affiliation with ingroups [48], and detecting ostracism from ingroups [49]

RITUAL:

As populations increased in numbers of nonkin over human history, rituals may have allowed social groups to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for physical and social proximity.

Engaging in rituals serves a variety of functions that help solve adaptive problems associated with coordinated and cooperative group action [91,92]. Rituals mark group members in practically and psychologically powerful ways and hence provide a means of identifying ingroup members.

Social group living entails tension or conflict between individual interests and group interests [96]. Rituals might be one way to reduce within-group conflict and facilitate cooperation with social coalitions [97].

rituals are useful to the groups who perform them because they function as mechanisms of social group cohesion and foster the longevity of social groups [50,51,98,99,130,131].

Ritual is a psychologically prepared, species-typical behavior. The evolution of ritual builds upon selective social learning biases that may have become increasingly specialized for affiliative functions within social groups [50,51].

Instrumental versus conventional behaviour:
Where ambiguity in inter- pretation exists, learners may seek out cues to determine how to interpret the primary goal of the behavior. Much of human behavior is a blend of instrumental and conventional acts; in practice, the difference in interpretation of the goal of behavior is often a matter of degree rather than type [14].

New research has demonstrated that children use social cues to adjudicate between whether a behavior has an instrumental or conventional goal, imitating with higher fidelity for conventional versus instrumental tasks [14–17].


INNOVATION:
We have argued that there is strong adaptive value to high fidelity replication of others' behaviors and actions. This is a solid foundation for the transmission of skills and technologies that have proven effective in past generations. It has also provided a means by which causally opaque but culturally meaningful behaviors can be maintained.

Normativity hinders innovation/flow/creativity?
Yet surprisingly, a number of other animals are more sophisticated tool innovators than young children. The tube and floating object tasks designed to assess tool innovation (detailed below) were originally developed to test New Caledonian crows [78] and great apes, respectively [79]. In both cases, the animals passed their respective tests. Tool innovation proclivities have also been reported in chimpanzees [80,81]. This is noteworthy, as there are very few social–cognitive tests that can be passed by members of these species but not by children around 3 years of age and older [82].},

Additionally, corvids and parrots have much higher proportions of brain neurons located in the pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals and birds. Thus, large-brained parrots and corvids have forebrain neuron counts equal to or greater than primates with much larger brains. We suggest that the large numbers of neurons concentrated in high densities in the telencephalon substantially contribute to the neural basis of avian intelligence.},

abstract = {Most primates live in social groups in which affiliative bonds exist between individuals. Because these bonds need to be maintained through social interactions (grooming in most primates), sociality will be limited by time constraints. It has previously been shown that the time primates invest in grooming increases with group size. However, when groups become too large, individuals will not have enough time available to service all possible social relationships and group cohesion is expected to decrease. In this study, we used data from previously published studies to determine how large groups compromise on their grooming time and how ecological, phylogenetic and life history variables affect time invested in grooming (across species as well as within taxa). We used path analysis to analyse direct and indirect (via group size) effects on grooming. We showed that not only is grooming time determined by group size, but it is also affected by dispersal patterns and sex ratio. Furthermore, we found that grooming time is asymptotic when group size exceeds 40 individuals, indicating that time constraints resulting from ecological pressure force individuals to compromise on their grooming time. This was true across species, but a similar effect was also found within taxa. Cognitive constraints and predation pressure strongly affect group sizes and thereby have an indirect effect on primate grooming time. Primates that were found to live in groups larger than predicted by their neocortex size usually suffered from greater predation risk. However, most populations in our analysis were placed well within what we define as their eco-cognitive niche. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Sociality implies preserving relationships between group members

An increase in group size and/or in competition for food within the group can result in decrease certain social interactions between members, and the group may split irreversibly as a consequence.

One individual may try to maintain bonds with a maximum of group members in order to keep group cohesion, i.e. proximity and stable relationships.

Living in group implies interacting frequently with other group members in order to maintain group cohesion (Lehmann et al., 2007).

Group cohesion may be defined using three criteria: stability, coordination and proximity.

In primates, irreversible group fissions rarely occur (about every five/ten years) and separa- tion of different sub-groups often takes several months to years (Chepko-Sade and Sade, 1979; Okamoto andMatsumura, 2001; Van Horn et al., 2007).

In primates, grooming is considered to be the most common
behavior for the maintenance of close social bonds (Schino, 2001). Previous studies have shown that when an individual regularly grooms a particular partner, it seems to be more tolerant with this partner and more likely to support it during a conflict (without suggesting causality).},

abstract = {Socioecological models aim to predict the effect of environmental variables on species' ecology and social behaviour. Larger groups should face more within-group food competition than smaller groups but benefit from a reduction in predation pressure and/or between-group food competition. The balance between benefits and costs of living in larger groups may vary between populations and species. Moreover, sample size is usually relatively small in field studies and this increases variation in the results. We used meta-analytical techniques to analyse the effect of group size on behaviour and fitness in an attempt to measure the benefits and costs related to group size differences in primates. Meta-analysis allows the presence of an overall effect to be determined across different studies and taxa while controlling for sample size. We selected published papers from the PrimateLit database (http://primatelit.library.wisc.edu). Larger groups travelled further per day and spent more time feeding than smaller groups. Time spent on social behaviour and resting was not affected by group size differences. We found partial support for a decrease in female fecundity in larger groups whereas no significant difference was found for juvenile survival. These results were relatively unaffected by habitat characteristics, by species' ecology and social structure, and by indirect measures of predation risk. Our findings indicate that folivores and frugivores face similar ecological pressures and suggest that the costs of living in larger groups balance or outweigh the benefits. ?? 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Human wellbeing in modern societies relies on social cohesion, which can be characterized by high levels of cooperation and a large number of social ties. Both features, however, are frequently challenged by individual self-interest. In fact, the stability of social and economic systems can suddenly break down as the recent financial crisis and outbreaks of civil wars illustrate. To understand the conditions for the emergence and robustness of social cohesion, we simulate the creation of public goods among mobile agents, assuming that behavioral changes are determined by individual satisfaction. Specifically, we study a generalized win-stay-lose-shift learning model, which is only based on previous experience and rules out greenbeard effects that would allow individuals to guess future gains. The most noteworthy aspect of this model is that it promotes cooperation in social dilemma situations despite very low information requirements and without assuming imitation, a shadow of the future, reputation effects, signaling, or punishment. We find that moderate greediness favors social cohesion by a coevolution between cooperation and spatial organization, additionally showing that those cooperation-enforcing levels of greediness can be evolutionarily selected. However, a maladaptive trend of increasing greediness, although enhancing individuals' returns in the beginning, eventually causes cooperation and social relationships to fall apart. Our model is, therefore, expected to shed light on the long-standing problem of the emergence and stability of cooperative behavior.},

abstract = {Children and adults respond negatively to inequity. Traditional accounts of inequity aversion suggest that as children mature into adults, they become less likely to endorse all forms of inequity. We challenge the idea that children have a unified concern with inequity that simply becomes stronger with age. Instead, we argue that the developmental trajectory of inequity aversion depends on whether the inequity is seen as fair or unfair. In three studies (N = 501), 7- to 8-year-olds were more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to create inequity that disadvantaged themselves—a fair type of inequity. In findings consistent with our theory, 7- to 8-year-olds were not more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to endorse advantageous inequity (Study 1) or inequity created by third parties (Studies 2 and 3)—unfair types of inequity. We discuss how these results expand on recent accounts of children's developing concerns with generosity and partiality},

abstract = {The complexity of nervous systems alters the evolvability of behaviour. Complex nervous systems are phylogenetically constrained; nevertheless particular species-specific behaviours have repeatedly evolved, suggesting a predisposition towards those behaviours. Independently evolved behaviours in animals that share a common neural architecture are generally produced by homologous neural structures, homologous neural pathways and even in the case of some invertebrates, homologous identified neurons. Such parallel evolution has been documented in the chromatic sensitivity of visual systems, motor behaviours and complex social behaviours such as pair-bonding. The appearance of homoplasious behaviours produced by homologous neural substrates suggests that there might be features of these nervous systems that favoured the repeated evolution of particular behaviours. Neuromodulation may be one such feature because it allows anatomically defined neural circuitry to be re-purposed. The developmental, genetic and physiological mechanisms that contribute to nervous system complexity may also bias the evolution of behaviour, thereby affecting the evolvability of species-specific behaviour.},

Here we demonstrate that subjective estimates of uncertainty predict the dynamics of subjective and physiological stress responses. Subjects learned a probabilistic mapping between visual stimuli and electric shocks. Salivary cortisol confirmed that our stressor elicited changes in endocrine activity. Using a hierarchical Bayesian learning model, we quantified the relationship between the different forms of subjective task uncertainty and acute stress responses. Subjective stress, pupil diameter and skin conductance all tracked the evolution of irreducible uncertainty. We observed a coupling between emotional and somatic state, with subjective and physiological tuning to uncertainty tightly correlated. Furthermore, the uncertainty tuning of subjective and physiological stress predicted individual task performance, consistent with an adaptive role for stress in learning under uncertain threat. Our finding that stress responses are tuned to environmental uncertainty provides new insight into their generation and likely adaptive function.},

Here we suggest that these features are best explained as the outcome of evolved human cognition, in such domains as mating, moral judgment and social exchange. As empirical illustrations, we show how this evolved psychology makes marriage systems, legal norms and commons management systems intuitively obvious and compelling, thereby ensuring their occurrence and cultural stability. We extend this to propose under what conditions institutions can become ‘natural', compelling and legitimate, and outline probable paths for institutional change given human cognitive dispositions. Explaining institutions in terms of these exogenous factors also suggests that a general theory of institutions as such is neither necessary nor in fact possible. What are required are domain-specific accounts of institutional design in different domains of evolved cognition. },

However, though relatively small, the cerebellum contains about four times more neurons than the neocortex. I show that commonly used comparative measures such as neocortex ratio underestimate the contribution of the cerebellum to brain evolution. Once differences in the scaling of connectivity in neocortex and cerebellum are accounted for, a marked and general pattern of correlated evolution of the two structures is apparent. One deviation from this general pattern is a relative expansion of the cerebellum in apes and other extractive foragers. The confluence of these comparative patterns, studies of ape foraging skills and social learning, and recent evidence on the cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum, suggest an important role for the cerebellum in the evolution of the capacity for planning, execution and understanding of complex behavioural sequences--including tool use and language. There is no clear separation between sensory-motor and cognitive specializations underpinning such skills, undermining the notion of executive control as a distinct process. Instead, I argue that cognitive evolution is most effectively understood as the elaboration of specialized systems for embodied adaptive control.},

There have been different selection pressures on organisms at different times in ontogeny, and some characteristics of infants and children were selected in evolution to serve an adaptive function at that time in their life history rather than to prepare individuals for later adulthood. Examples of such adaptive functions of immaturity are provided from infancy, play, and cognitive development. Most evolved psychological mechanisms are proposed to be domain specific in nature and have been identified for various aspects of children's cognitive and social development, most notably for the acquisition of language and for theory of mind. Differences in the quality and quantity of parental investment affect children's development and influence their subsequent reproductive and childcare strategies. Some sex differences observed in childhood, particularly as expressed during play, are seen as antecedents and preparations for adult sex differences. Because evolved mechanisms were adaptive to ancestral environments, they are not always adaptive for contemporary people, and this mismatch of evolved mechanisms with modern environments is seen in children's maladjustment to some aspects of formal schooling. We argue that an evolutionary perspective can be valuable for developing a better understanding of human ontogeny in contemporary society and that a developmental perspective is important for a better understanding of evolutionary psychology.},

Specifically, we offer a primer on evolutionary psychology that we then discuss in the context of several research avenues in sport and exercise. Next, we discuss how evolutionary psychology can inform our understanding of sporting culture. Design: Review paper. Methods: Theory and research are selectively reviewed in efforts to demonstrate the utility and limits of evolutionary psychology as an approach to sport and exercise psychology. Results and conclusions: Evolutionary psychology offers researchers in sport and exercise psychology an improved capacity to produce proximate explanations (i.e., how psychological mechanisms interact with the environment to produce behavior) by generating productive and novel hypotheses from ultimate explanations (i.e., why a psychological mechanism evolved a particular design; Tooby {\&} Cosmides, 1992, 2005). The worth of integrating proximate and ultimate explanations is demonstrated by the ensuing novel insights of popular avenues of sport and exercise psychology including (a) the interrelation between motivation and reasoning and their relative influence on exercise behavior, (b) sex differences in sport participation, (c) performance in sport, and (d) group dynamics in sport. Unlike specific fields of psychology, evolutionary psychology is a metatheoretical approach that can foster mutually productive linkages between currently disparate areas within sport and exercise psychology, and with neighboring disciplines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

With the exception of Neanderthals, the growth patterns of fossil hominins have not been studied comprehensively because the fossil record currently lacks specimens that document both cranial and postcranial development at young ontogenetic stages. Here we describe a well-preserved 3.3-million-year-old juvenile partial skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis discovered in the Dikika research area of Ethiopia. The skull of the approximately three-year-old presumed female shows that most features diagnostic of the species are evident even at this early stage of development. The find includes many previously unknown skeletal elements from the Pliocene hominin record, including a hyoid bone that has a typical African ape morphology. The foot and other evidence from the lower limb provide clear evidence for bipedal locomotion, but the gorilla-like scapula and long and curved manual phalanges raise new questions about the importance of arboreal behaviour in the A. afarensis locomotor repertoire.},

abstract = {The authors examined whether, similar to collective agent behaviors in complex, biological systems (e.g., schools of fish and colonies of ants), performers in team sports displayed functional coordination tendencies, based on local interaction rules during performance. To investigate this issue, they used videogrammetry and digitizing procedures to observe interpersonal interactions in common 4 versus 2 + 2 subphases of the team sport of rugby union, involving 16 participants aged between 16 and 17 years of age. They observed pattern-forming dynamics in attacking subunits (n = 4 players) attempting to penetrate 2 defensive lines (n = 2 players in each). Data showed that within each attacking subunit, the 4 players displayed emergent functional grouping tendencies that differed between the 2 defensive lines. Results confirmed that grouping tendencies in attacking subunits of team games are sensitive to different task constraints, such as relative positioning to nearest defenders. It was concluded that running correlations were particularly useful for measuring the level of interpersonal coordination in functional grouping tendencies within attacking subunits.},

We examined whether coupling tendencies of members of each dyad shaped key performance outcomes (try or successful tackle). Data on movement displacement trajectories of eight male rugby union players (aged 11-12 years) were analysed during performance in 47 trials. To assess coordination tendencies during exploratory behaviours in the dyads, analyses of performance time series data were undertaken using variable time graphs, running correlations and cross-correlations. Results revealed distinct coupling patterns characterised by shifts between synchronous coordination and asynchronous coordination tendencies and uncoordinated actions. Observed behaviours were interpreted as attempts of competing participants to create and perceive possibilities for action while seeking to achieve specific performance goals. Findings also revealed that a variety of patterned relations between participants resulted in different performance outcomes.},

Study 2 showed that task-related self-efficacy and collective efficacy explained performance satisfaction at seven-month follow-up, whereas self-efficacy referring to social barriers explained shooting performance at seven-month follow-up. Indirect associations between mindfulness and performance were found with three types of self-efficacy referring to social barriers, operating as parallel mediators. Results provide evidence for the role of beliefs about the ability to cope with social barriers and show a complex interplay between different types of self-efficacy and collective efficacy in predicting team sport performance.},

We hypothesized that high interpersonal coordination patterns are a crucial issue to cross (or not) the gain line. Video record and digitizing procedures were used as a method to collect data for further analysis of interpersonal coordination patterns that took place during the formation of subunits of attack. The results showed the existence of three types of outputs, which differ depending on the correlations between attackers and defenders. Therefore, for high and positive values of interpersonal coordination (r values between 0.8 {\textless} r {\textless} 1), there are possibilities of action that lead to success when the opponents have inverse or lower values of correlation. The conclusion was that interpersonal coordination within subunits becomes a relevant factor in analyzing the success in each game situation.},

abstract = {Spontaneous social coordination has been extensively described in natural settings but so far no controlled methodological approaches have been employed that systematically advance investigations into the possible self-organized nature of bond formation and dissolution between humans. We hypothesized that, under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony-a well-described phenomenon in biological and physical settings-could emerge spontaneously between humans as a result of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonal interactions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairs of participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions, while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed by someone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase and frequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developed and used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as they exchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed to coordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degree to which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the social encounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.},

We will discuss the concept of the multi-image (more than two CCD-frames) measurement mode, the bundle adjustment with its variants for point positioning, orientation and calibration, the notions of precision and reliability, system aspects including some details on CCD-cameras and image data transfer, calibration and self-calibration, algorithms for high precision image measurements, and finally show a typical application example. Besides being a highly automated measurement technique, videogrammetry provides for high accuracy (a relative accuracy of 1: 10000 can be reached in trajectory determination with standard components) and truly real-time data processing capabilities. In addition, a great number of particles ({\textgreater} 100) can be measured and tracked simultaneously, and surfaces and their deformation can be determined. Therefore, the videogrammetric technique is of great interest for applications in biomechanics, sport, animation, and virtual reality generation and control.},

abstract = {Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed toward real-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is mutual information exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to the other while simultaneously producing actions that alter the other. Combining mathematical and neurophysiological methods, we introduce a paradigm called the human dynamic clamp (HDC), to directly manipulate the interaction or coupling between a human and a surrogate constructed to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clamp used so productively in cellular neuroscience, the HDC allows a person to interact in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by well-established models of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand movements with the visually observed movements of a virtual hand, the parameters of which depend on input from the subject's own movements. We demonstrate that HDC can be extended to cover a broad repertoire of human behavior, including rhythmic and discrete movements, adaptation to changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning as specified by a virtual "teacher." We propose HDC as a general paradigm, best implemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models have been developed in a particular scientific field. The HDC paradigm is powerful because it provides an opportunity to explore parameter ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary human interactions. The HDC not only enables to test the veracity of theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always apparent in real-time human social interactions and the brain correlates thereof.},

The evolution of our lineage after the last common ancestor we shared with chimpanzees has therefore remained unclear. Ardipithecus ramidus, recovered in ecologically and temporally resolved contexts in Ethiopia's Afar Rift, now illuminates earlier hominid paleobiology and aspects of extant African ape evolution. More than 110 specimens recovered from 4.4-million-year-old sediments include a partial skeleton with much of the skull, hands, feet, limbs, and pelvis. This hominid combined arboreal palmigrade clambering and careful climbing with a form of terrestrial bipedality more primitive than that of Australopithecus. Ar. ramidus had a reduced canine/premolar complex and a little-derived cranial morphology and consumed a predominantly C3 plant-based diet (plants using the C3 photosynthetic pathway). Its ecological habitat appears to have been largely woodland-focused. Ar. ramidus lacks any characters typical of suspension, vertical climbing, or knuckle-walking. Ar. ramidus indicates that despite the genetic similarities of living humans and chimpanzees, the ancestor we last shared probably differed substantially from any extant African ape. Hominids and extant African apes have each become highly specialized through very different evolutionary pathways. This evidence also illuminates the origins of orthogrady, bipedality, ecology, diet, and social behavior in earliest Hominidae and helps to define the basal hominid adaptation, thereby accentuating the derived nature of Australopithecus.},

We predicted that synchrony, due to an ability to elicit low-level appraisals of similarity, would enhance a basic compassionate response toward victims of moral transgressions and thereby increase subsequent costly helping behavior on their behalf. Using a manipulation of rhythmic synchrony, we show that synchronous others are not only perceived to be more similar to oneself but also evoke more compassion and altruistic behavior than asynchronous others experiencing the same plight. These findings both support the view that a primary function of synchrony is to mark others as similar to the self and provide the first empirical demonstration that synchrony-induced affiliation modulates emotional responding and altruism.},

Human morality arose evolutionarily as a set of skills and motives for cooperating with others, and the ontogeny of these skills and motives unfolds in part naturally and in part as a result of sociocultural contexts and interactions.},

abstract = {Some researchers have claimed that chimpanzee and human culture rest on homologous cognitive and learning mechanisms. While clearly there are some homologous mechanisms, we argue here that there are some different mechanisms at work as well. Chimpanzee cultural traditions represent behavioural biases of different populations, all within the species' existing cognitive repertoire (what we call the 'zone of latent solutions') that are generated by founder effects, individual learning and mostly product-oriented (rather than process-oriented) copying. Human culture, in contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over time (what we call the 'ratchet effect'). This difference results from the facts that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans' unique form of cumulative cultural evolution.},

abstract = {We propose that the crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species is the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions: shared intentionality. Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with others and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.},

Although the degree to which early hominins ate meat remains controversial, here we reevaluate the notion, originally suggested by Schaller and Lowther in 1969, that mammalian carnivores can shed light on human origins. Precisely when cooperation evolved in hominins or carnivores is unknown, but species from both groups cooperatively hunt large game, defend resources, guard against predators, and rear young. We present a large-scale comparative analysis of extant carnivore species, quantifying anatomical, ecological, and behavioral correlates of cooperation to determine whether metabolic rate, body and relative brain size, life history traits, and social cohesion coevolved with cooperation. We focus heavily on spotted hyenas, which live in more complex societies than other carnivores. Hyenas regularly join forces with kin and nonkin to hunt large antelope and to defend resources during intergroup conflicts and disputes with lions. Our synthesis highlights reduced sexual dimorphism, increased reproductive investment, high population density, fission-fusion dynamics, endurance hunting of big game in open habitats, and large brains as important correlates of cooperation among carnivores. We discuss the relevance of our findings to understanding the origins of cooperation in hominins.},

abstract = {Identity fusion is a relatively unexplored form of alignment with groups that entails a visceral feeling of oneness with the group. This feeling is associated with unusually porous, highly permeable borders between the personal and social self. These porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that the personal and social self will combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Furthermore, the strong personal as well as social identities possessed by highly fused persons cause them to recognize other group members not merely as members of the group but also as unique individuals, prompting the development of strong relational as well as collective ties within the group. In local fusion, people develop relational ties to members of relatively small groups (e.g., families or work teams) with whom they have personal relationships. In extended fusion, people project relational ties onto relatively large collectives composed of many individuals with whom they may have no personal relationships. The research literature indicates that measures of fusion are exceptionally strong predictors of extreme pro-group behavior. Moreover, fusion effects are amplified by augmenting individual agency, either directly (by increasing physiological arousal) or indirectly (by activating personal or social identities). The effects of fusion on pro-group actions are mediated by perceptions of arousal and invulnerability. Possible causes of identity fusion--ranging from relatively distal, evolutionary, and cultural influences to more proximal, contextual influences--are discussed. Finally, implications and future directions are considered.},

Twenty-four individuals rowed on ergometers for 45 min in both individual and group conditions. Half the participants rowed in the group condition with teammates, whereas the other half rowed them with confederates. ANOVA procedures revealed pain tolerance was significantly higher after participating in a group condition than in an individual condition, and that there was no significant difference between a group of strangers and teammates. This higher pain tolerance has been inferred as an indicator of endorphin activity, which may be related to behavioral synchrony.},

To explain these cross-cultural differences, we use data collected from the Human Relations Area Files electronic databases (eHRAF) to test two sets of hypotheses derived from signaling theory. If costly male rites serve to signal mate quality, they would be expected to correlate with the intensity of mating competition. If they serve to signal group commitments, they would be expected to be associated with the importance of overcoming problems of collective action. Our results support the latter set of hypotheses: males in societies that engage in warfare endure the costliest rites. Moreover, we show that whether wars are fought within cultural groups or against other cultural groups is an important determinant of whether or not male rites result in permanent visible marks, such as ritual scars. We argue that costly male rites signal commitment and promote solidarity among males who must organize for warfare. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since the last common ancestor shared by modern humans, chimpanzees and bonobos, the lineage leading to Homo sapiens has undergone a substantial change in brain size and organization. As a result, modern humans display striking differences from the living apes in the realm of cognition and linguistic expression. In this article, we review the evolutionary changes that occurred in the descent of Homo sapiens by reconstructing the neural and cognitive traits that would have characterized the last common ancestor and comparing these with the modern human condition. The last common ancestor can be reconstructed to have had a brain of approximately 300-400 g that displayed several unique phylogenetic specializations of development, anatomical organization, and biochemical function. These neuroanatomical substrates contributed to the enhancement of behavioral flexibility and social cognition. With this evolutionary history as precursor, the modern human mind may be conceived as a mosaic of traits inherited from a common ancestry with our close relatives, along with the addition of evolutionary specializations within particular domains. These modern human-specific cognitive and linguistic adaptations appear to be correlated with enlargement of the neocortex and related structures. Accompanying this general neocortical expansion, certain higher-order unimodal and multimodal cortical areas have grown disproportionately relative to primary cortical areas. Anatomical and molecular changes have also been identified that might relate to the greater metabolic demand and enhanced synaptic plasticity of modern human brain's. Finally, the unique brain growth trajectory of modern humans has made a significant contribution to our species' cognitive and linguistic abilities.},

In this article we outline how studies on joint attention, action observation, task sharing, action coordination and agency contribute to the understanding of the cognitive and neural processes supporting joint action.

abstract = {Previous research has shown that the matching of rhythmic behaviour between individuals (synchrony) increases cooperation. Such synchrony is most noticeable in music, dance and collective rituals. As well as the matching of behaviour, such collective performances typically involve shared intentionality: performers actively collaborate to produce joint actions. Over three experiments we examined the importance of shared intentionality in promoting cooperation from group synchrony. Experiment 1 compared a condition in which group synchrony was produced through shared intentionality to conditions in which synchrony or asynchrony were created as a by-product of hearing the same or different rhythmic beats. We found that synchrony combined with shared intentionality produced the greatest level of cooperation. To examinef the importance of synchrony when shared intentionality is present, Experiment 2 compared a condition in which participants deliberately worked together to produce synchrony with a condition in which participants deliberately worked together to produce asynchrony. We found that synchrony combined with shared intentionality produced the greatest level of cooperation. Experiment 3 manipulated both the presence of synchrony and shared intentionality and found significantly greater cooperation with synchrony and shared intentionality combined. Path analysis supported a reinforcement of cooperation model according to which perceiving synchrony when there is a shared goal to produce synchrony provides immediate feedback for successful cooperation so reinforcing the group's cooperative tendencies. The reinforcement of cooperation model helps to explain the evolutionary conservation of traditional music and dance performances, and furthermore suggests that the collectivist values of such cultures may be an essential part of the mechanisms by which synchrony galvanises cooperative behaviours.},

abstract = {There is disagreement in the literature about the exact nature of the phenomenon of empathy. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.},

abstract = {Although Darwin insisted that human intelligence could be fully explained by the theory of evolution, the codiscoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that abstract intelligence was of no use to ancestral humans and could only be explained by intelligent design. Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the "cognitive niche." This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.},

As philosopher Karl Popper has noticed, the current evolutionary theory is a theory of genes, and we still lack a theory of forms. The field began, in fact, as a theory of forms in Darwin's days, and the major goal that an EES will aim for is a unification of our theories of genes and of forms. This may be achieved through an organic grafting of novel concepts onto the foundational structure of the MS, particularly evolvability, phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, complexity theory, and the theory of evolution in highly dimensional adaptive landscapes.},

abstract = {Debate over the origin of modern humans continues without a clear end in sight. Currently, the genetic and fossil evidence is still used to support two different interpretations of the origin of modern humans. Some researchers claim that the genetic evidence is compatible with either an Out-of-Africa or a Multiregional model, while other scientists argue that the evidence supports only a Multiregional model of evolution. I argue that the fossil record and archeological evidence constrain interpretation of the genetic evidence and imply that very little, if any, admixture with Eurasian archaic hominins such as the Neanderthals occurred during the spread of modern humans out of Africa.},

abstract = {The derived proportions of the human hand may provide supportive buttressing that protects the hand from injury when striking with a fist. Flexion of digits 2-5 results in buttressing of the pads of the distal phalanges against the central palm and the palmar pads of the proximal phalanges. Additionally, adduction of the thenar eminence to abut the dorsal surface of the distal phalanges of digits 2 and 3 locks these digits into a solid configuration that may allow a transfer of energy through the thenar eminence to the wrist. To test the hypothesis of a performance advantage, we measured: (1) the forces and rate of change of acceleration (jerk) from maximum effort strikes of subjects striking with a fist and an open hand; (2) the static stiffness of the second metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joint in buttressed and unbuttressed fist postures; and (3) static force transfer from digits 2 and 3 to digit 1 also in buttressed and unbuttressed fist postures. We found that peak forces, force impulses and peak jerk did not differ between the closed fist and open palm strikes. However, the structure of the human fist provides buttressing that increases the stiffness of the second MCP joint by fourfold and, as a result of force transfer through the thenar eminence, more than doubles the ability of the proximal phalanges to transmit 'punching' force. Thus, the proportions of the human hand provide a performance advantage when striking with a fist. We propose that the derived proportions of hominin hands reflect, in part, sexual selection to improve fighting performance.},

I review two classes of evolutionary explanation for cultural variation, ‘evoked' and ‘transmitted' culture, and argue that these two classes of mechanism enrich and strengthen existing social science accounts, as well as making new predictions. I suggest a high degree of mutual compatibility and potential gains from trade between the social and biological sciences. Introduction:},

abstract = {Human behavioral ecology (HBE) is the study of human behavior from an adaptive perspective. It focuses in particular on how human behavior varies with ecological context. Although HBE is a thriving research area, there has not been a major review published in a journal for over a decade, and much has changed in that time. Here, we describe the main features of HBE as a paradigm and review HBE research published since the millennium. We find that the volume of HBE research is growing rapidly, and its composition is changing in terms of topics, study populations, methodology, and disciplinary affiliations of authors. We identify the major strengths of HBE research as its vitality, clear predictions, empirical fruitfulness, broad scope, conceptual coherence, ecological validity, increasing methodological rigor, and topical innovation. Its weaknesses include a relative isolation from the rest of behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology and a somewhat limited current topic base. As HBE continues to grow, there is a major opportunity for it to serve as a bridge between the natural and social sciences and help unify disparate disciplinary approaches to human behavior. HBE also faces a number of open questions, such as how understanding of proximate mechanisms is to be integrated with behavioral ecology's traditional focus on optimal behavioral strategies, and the causes and extent of maladaptive behavior in humans},

Here we investigate the developmental origins of these biases, asking if preference for similar others occurs prior to language and extensive exposure to cultural norms. We demonstrate that, like adults, prelinguistic infants prefer those who share even trivial similarities with themselves, and these preferences appear to reflect a cognitive comparison process (" like me" /" not like me"). However, unlike adults, infants do not appear to prefer others with an utterly arbitrary similarity to themselves. Together, these findings suggest that the phenomena of ingroup bias, and enhanced interpersonal attraction toward those who resemble ourselves, may be rooted in an inherent preference for similarity to self, which itself may be enhanced during development by the influence of cultural values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we report stone-tool-inflicted marks on bones found during recent survey work in Dikika, Ethiopia, a research area close to Gona and Bouri. On the basis of low-power microscopic and environmental scanning electron microscope observations, these bones show unambiguous stone-tool cut marks for flesh removal and percussion marks for marrow access. The bones derive from the Sidi Hakoma Member of the Hadar Formation. Established (40)Ar-(39)Ar dates on the tuffs that bracket this member constrain the finds to between 3.42 and 3.24 Myr ago, and stratigraphic scaling between these units and other geological evidence indicate that they are older than 3.39 Myr ago. Our discovery extends by approximately 800,000 years the antiquity of stone tools and of stone-tool-assisted consumption of ungulates by hominins; furthermore, this behaviour can now be attributed to Australopithecus afarensis.},

Mayr equated proximate causation with immediate factors (for example, physiology) and ultimate causation with evolutionary explanations (for example, natural selection). He argued that proximate and ultimate causes addressed different questions and were not alternatives. Mayr's account of causation remains widely accepted today, with both positive and negative ramifications. Several current debates in biology (for example, over evolution and development, niche construction, cooperation, and the evolution of language) are linked by a common axis of acceptance/rejection of Mayr's model of causation. We argue that Mayr's formulation has acted to stabilize the dominant evolutionary paradigm against change but may now hamper progress in the biological sciences.},

abstract = {Our genome adapts slowly to changing conditions of existence. Many diseases of civilisation result from mismatches between our Paleolithic genome and the rapidly changing environment, including our diet. The objective of the present study was to reconstruct multiple Paleolithic diets to estimate the ranges of nutrient intakes upon which humanity evolved. A database of, predominantly East African, plant and animal foods (meat/fish) was used to model multiple Paleolithic diets, using two pathophysiological constraints (i.e. protein {\textless} 35 energy {\%} (en{\%}) and linoleic acid (LA) {\textgreater}1.0 en{\%}), at known hunter-gatherer plant/animal food intake ratios (range 70/30-30/70 en{\%}/en{\%}). We investigated selective and non-selective savannah, savannah/aquatic and aquatic hunter-gatherer/scavenger foraging strategies. We found (range of medians in en{\%}) intakes of moderate-to-high protein (25-29), moderate-to-high fat (30-39) and moderate carbohydrates (39-40). The fatty acid composition was SFA (11.4-12.0), MUFA (5.6-18.5) and PUFA (8.6-15.2). The latter was high in $\alpha$-linolenic acid (ALA) (3.7-4.7 en{\%}), low in LA (2.3-3.6 en{\%}), and high in long-chain PUFA (LCP; 4.75-25.8 g/d), LCP n-3 (2.26-17.0 g/d), LCP n-6 (2.54-8.84 g/d), ALA/LA ratio (1.12-1.64 g/g) and LCP n-3/LCP n-6 ratio (0.84-1.92 g/g). Consistent with the wide range of employed variables, nutrient intakes showed wide ranges. We conclude that compared with Western diets, Paleolithic diets contained consistently higher protein and LCP, and lower LA. These are likely to contribute to the known beneficial effects of Paleolithic-like diets, e.g. through increased satiety/satiation. Disparities between Paleolithic, contemporary and recommended intakes might be important factors underlying the aetiology of common Western diseases. Data on Paleolithic diets and lifestyle, rather than the investigation of single nutrients, might be useful for the rational design of clinical trials.},

In order to accomplish a communal task, participants need to develop a common rhythm if they are to coordinate their actions. Indeed, the harder the collective task, the more critical - but difficult - it is for participants to develop a common rhythm in order to synchronize their actions. Rhythm is thus an important and recurrent feature of social performance. This article explores the ways in which participants try to generate common rhythm in order to execute collective performances. To this end, the paper takes a single sporting example. It examines a decisive period in the 153rd Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in 2007 to examine how a small social group, the Cambridge crew, struggled to create and maintain a rhythm in order to maximize their rowing performance.},

Four studies investigated the circumstances under which toddlers would trust testimony that conflicted with their expectations about the physical world. Thirty-month-olds believed testimony that conflicted with a naive bias (Study 1), and they also repeatedly trusted testimony that conflicted with an event they had just seen (Study 2)-even when they had an incentive to ignore the testimony (Study 3). Children responded more skeptically if they could see that the testimony was wrong as it was being delivered (Study 3), or if they had the opportunity to accumulate evidence confirming their initial belief before hearing someone contradict it (Study 4). Together, these studies demonstrate that toddlers have a robust bias to trust even surprising testimony, but this trust can be influenced by how much confidence they have in their initial belief. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We find that the effectiveness of government institutions correlates with favoring in-group members, even when controlling for pathogen stress and world region, assessing reverse causality, and providing a check on endogeneity with an instrumental variable analysis. Conversely, pathogen stress shows inconsistent associations with in-group favoritism when controlling for government effectiveness. Moreover, pathogen stress shows little to no association with in-group favoritism within major world regions whereas government effectiveness does. These results suggest that variation in in-group preferences across contemporary nation-states is more consistent with a generalized response to institutions that meet basic needs rather than an evolved response dedicated to pathogens.},

abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupl{\"{a}}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

However, few studies have examined whether behavior in experiments tells us anything about behavior in the “real world.” To investigate the external validity of several common experimental economics games, we compare game behavior with prosocial behavior among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of lowland Bolivia. We find that food-sharing patterns, social visitation, beer production and consumption, labor participation, and contributions to a feast are not robustly correlated with levels of giving in the economics games. Payoff structure and socioecological context may be more important in predicting prosocial behavior in a wide variety of domains than stable personality traits. We argue that future experimental methods should be tailored to specific research questions, show reduced anonymity, and incorporate repeat measures under a variety of conditions to inform and redirect ethnographic study and build scientific theory.},

The sexual selection hypothesis cannot easily account for the widespread performance of music and dance in groups (especially syn-chronized performances), and the social bonding hjrpothesis has severe theoretical difficulties. Humans are unique among the primates in their ability to form cooperative alliances between groups in the absence of con-sanguineal ties. We propose that this unique form of social organization is predicated on music and dance. Music and dance may have evolved as a coalition signaling system that could, among other things, credibly communicate coalition quality, thus permitting meaningful cooperative re-lationships between groups. This capability may have evolved from coor-dinated territorial defense signals that are common in many social species, including chimpanzees. We present a study in which manipulation of music synchrony significantly altered subjects' perceptions of music qual-ity, and in which subjects' perceptions of music quality were correlated with their perceptions of coalition quality, supporting our hypothesis. Our h)rpothesis also has implications for the evolution of psychological mech-anisms underlying cultural production in other domains such as food},

abstract = {The application of evolutionary theory to understanding the origins of our species' capacities for social learning has generated key insights into cultural evolution. By focusing on how our psychology has evolved to adaptively extract beliefs and practices by observing others, theorists have hypothesized how social learning can, over generations, give rise to culturally evolved adaptations. While much field research documents the subtle ways in which culturally transmitted beliefs and practices adapt people to their local environments, and much experimental work reveals the predicted patterns of social learning, little research connects real-world adaptive cultural traits to the patterns of transmission predicted by these theories. Addressing this gap, we show how food taboos for pregnant and lactating women in Fiji selectively target the most toxic marine species, effectively reducing a woman's chances of fish poisoning by 30 per cent during pregnancy and 60 per cent during breastfeeding. We further analyse how these taboos are transmitted, showing support for cultural evolutionary models that combine familial transmission with selective learning from locally prestigious individuals. In addition, we explore how particular aspects of human cognitive processes increase the frequency of some non-adaptive taboos. This case demonstrates how evolutionary theory can be deployed to explain both adaptive and non-adaptive behavioural patterns.},

The present review proposes a framework that integrates standard approaches from the cognitive science of religion with established models of cultural evolution and cultural learning. According to this synthetic approach, innate cognitive content biases explain how people mentally represent gods, and cultural evolutionary models explain why people come to believe and commit to the particular supernatural beliefs that they do.

abstract = {It is often the case in interdisciplinary accounts of human evolution that archaeological data are either ignored or treated superficially. This article sets out to redress this position by using archaeological evidence from the last 2.5 million years to test the social brain hypothesis (SBH) — that our social lives drove encephalization. To do this we construct a map of our evolving social complexity that concentrates on two resources — materials and emotions — that lie at the basis of all social interaction. In particular, novel cultural and biological mechanisms are seen as evolutionary responses to problems of cognitive load arising from the need to integrate more individuals and sub-units into the larger communities predicted by the SBH. The Palaeolithic evidence for the amplification of these twin resources into novel social forms is then evaluated. Here the SBH is used to differentiate three temporal movements (2.6–1.6 Ma, 1.5–0.4 Ma and 300–25 ka) and their varied evolutionary responses are described in detail. Attention is drawn to the second movement where there is an apparent disconnect between a rise in encephalization and a stasis in material culture. This disconnect is used to discuss the co-evolutionary relationship that existed between materials and emotions to solve cognitive problems but which, at different times, amplified one resource rather than the other. We conclude that the shape of the Palaeolithic is best conceived as a gradient of change rather than a set of step-like revolutions in society and culture.},

I argue that their discussion overstates the explanatory power of evolutionary psychology and does not take sufficient account of what we already know about institutions. At the same time, I suggest that they, and the empirical work upon which they draw, make an important contribution by helping us to establish more clearly the boundary conditions of institutional analysis. I call for ongoing cooperation and for the establishment of a unified research tradition that brings together both evolutionary psychology and institutionalism. },

abstract = {In this paper we examine how English and Mandarin speakers think about time, and we test how the patterns of thinking in the two groups relate to patterns in linguistic and cultural experience. In Mandarin, vertical spatial metaphors are used more frequently to talk about time than they are in English; English relies primarily on horizontal terms. We present results from two tasks comparing English and Mandarin speakers' temporal reasoning. The tasks measure how people spatialize time in three-dimensional space, including the sagittal (front/back), transverse (left/right), and vertical (up/down) axes. Results of Experiment 1 show that people automatically create spatial representations in the course of temporal reasoning, and these implicit spatializations differ in accordance with patterns in language, even in a non-linguistic task. Both groups showed evidence of a left-to-right representation of time, in accordance with writing direction, but only Mandarin speakers showed a vertical top-to-bottom pattern for time (congruent with vertical spatiotemporal metaphors in Mandarin). Results of Experiment 2 confirm and extend these findings, showing that bilinguals' representations of time depend on both long-term and proximal aspects of language experience. Participants who were more proficient in Mandarin were more likely to arrange time vertically (an effect of previous language experience). Further, bilinguals were more likely to arrange time vertically when they were tested in Mandarin than when they were tested in English (an effect of immediate linguistic context).},

abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

Here we discuss this correlation in the light of results provided by our first hand analysis of ancient and recently discovered relevant archaeological and paleontological material from Africa and Europe. We focus in particular on the evolutionary significance of lithic and bone technology, the emergence of symbolism, Neandertal behavioral patterns, the identification of early mortuary practices, the anatomical evidence for the acquisition of language, the development of conscious symbolic storage, the emergence of musical traditions, and the archaeological evidence for the diversification of languages during the Upper Paleolithic. This critical reappraisal contradicts the hypothesis of a symbolic revolution coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans in Europe some 40,000 years ago, but also highlights inconsistencies in the anatomically–culturally modern equation and the potential contribution of anatomically “pre-modern” human populations to the emergence of these abilities. No firm evidence of conscious symbolic storage and musical traditions are found before the Upper Paleolithic. However, the oldest known European objects that testify to these practices already show a high degree of complexity and geographic variability suggestive of possible earlier, and still unrecorded, phases of development.},

In four experiments (N = 883) spanning two cultures and two status groups within one of those cultures, we obtained new evidence that implicit intergroup attitudes emerge in young children in a form indistinguishable from adult attitudes. Strikingly, this invariance from childhood to adulthood holds for members of socially dominant majorities, who consistently favor their in-group, as well as for members of a disadvantaged minority, who, from the early moments of race-based categorization, do not show a preference for their in-group. Far from requiring a protracted period of internalization, implicit intergroup attitudes are characterized by early enculturation and developmental invariance.},

abstract = {This study investigated movement synchronization of players within and between teams during competitive association football performance. Cluster phase analysis was introduced as a method to assess synchronies between whole teams and between individual players with their team as a function of time, ball possession and field direction. Measures of dispersion (SD) and regularity (sample entropy - SampEn - and cross sample entropy - Cross-SampEn) were used to quantify the magnitude and structure of synchrony. Large synergistic relations within each professional team sport collective were observed, particularly in the longitudinal direction of the field (0.89. ±. 0.12) compared to the lateral direction (0.73. ±. 0.16, p{\textless}.01). The coupling between the group measures of the two teams also revealed that changes in the synchrony of each team were intimately related (Cross-SampEn values of 0.02. ±. 0.01). Interestingly, ball possession did not influence team synchronization levels. In player-team synchronization, individuals tended to be coordinated under near in-phase modes with team behavior (mean ranges between -7 and 5° of relative phase). The magnitudes of variations were low, but more irregular in time, for the longitudinal (SD: 18. ±. 3°; SampEn: 0.07. ±. 0.01), compared to the lateral direction (SD: 28. ±. 5°; SampEn: 0.06. ±. 0.01, p{\textless}.05) on-field. Increases in regularity were also observed between the first (SampEn: 0.07. ±. 0.01) and second half (SampEn: 0.06. ±. 0.01, p{\textless}.05) of the observed competitive game. Findings suggest that the method of analysis introduced in the current study may offer a suitable tool for examining team's synchronization behaviors and the mutual influence of each team's cohesiveness in competing social collectives. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We evaluate our propositions against the fossil record in the context of a broader review of evolution of the locomotor system from the earliest hominoids of modern aspect (crown hominoids) to early modern Homo sapiens. While some early East African stem hominoids were pronograde, it appears that the adaptations which best characterize the crown hominoids are orthogrady and an ability to abduct the arm above the shoulder - rather than, as is often thought, manual suspension sensu stricto. At 7-9 Ma (not much earlier than the likely 4-8 Ma divergence date for panins and hominins, see Bradley, 2008) there were crown hominoids in southern Europe which were adapted to moving in an orthograde posture, supported primarily on the hindlimb, in an arboreal, and possibly for Oreopithecus, a terrestrial context. By 7 Ma, Sahelanthropus provides evidence of a Central African hominin, panin or possibly gorilline adapted to orthogrady, and both orthogrady and habitually highly extended postures of the hip are evident in the arboreal East African protohominin Orrorin at 6 Ma. If the traditional idea that hominins passed through a terrestrial 'knuckle-walking' phase is correct, not only does it have to be explained how a quadrupedal gait typified by flexed postures of the hindlimb could have preadapted the body for the hominin acquisition of straight-legged erect bipedality, but we would have to accept a transition from stem-hominoid pronogrady to crown hominoid orthogrady, back again to pronogrady in the African apes and then back to orthogrady in hominins. Hand-assisted arboreal bipedality, which is part of a continuum of orthograde behaviours, is used by modern orangutans to forage among the small branches at the periphery of trees where the core hominoid dietary resource, ripe fruit, is most often to be found. Derivation of habitual terrestrial bipedality from arboreal hand-assisted bipedality requires fewer transitions, and is also kinematically and kinetically more parsimonious.},

abstract = {We propose that the cognitive mechanisms that enable the transmission of cultural knowledge by communication between individuals constitute a system of 'natural pedagogy' in humans, and represent an evolutionary adaptation along the hominin lineage. We discuss three kinds of arguments that support this hypothesis. First, natural pedagogy is likely to be human-specific: while social learning and communication are both widespread in non-human animals, we know of no example of social learning by communication in any other species apart from humans. Second, natural pedagogy is universal: despite the huge variability in child-rearing practices, all human cultures rely on communication to transmit to novices a variety of different types of cultural knowledge, including information about artefact kinds, conventional behaviours, arbitrary referential symbols, cognitively opaque skills and know-how embedded in means-end actions. Third, the data available on early hominin technological culture are more compatible with the assumption that natural pedagogy was an independently selected adaptive cognitive system than considering it as a by-product of some other human-specific adaptation, such as language. By providing a qualitatively new type of social learning mechanism, natural pedagogy is not only the product but also one of the sources of the rich cultural heritage of our species.},

Evolutionary analyses rule out the hypothesis that the brain mechanisms that cause race encoding evolved for that purpose. Consequently, race encoding must be a byproduct of mechanisms that evolved for some alternative function. But which one? Race is not encoded as a byproduct of domain-general perceptual processes. Two families of byproduct hypotheses remain: one invokes inferential machinery designed for tracking coalitional alliances, the other machinery designed for reasoning about natural kinds. Recent experiments show that manipulating coalitional variables can dramatically decrease the extent to which race is noticed and remembered.},

Here, we show that human participants' cumulative learning is not always reliant on sources of social information commonly assumed to be essential. Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching. Each condition was independently sufficient for participants to show cumulative learning. Because emulative learning can elicit cumulative culture on this task, we conclude that accounts of the unusual complexity of human culture in terms of species-unique learning mechanisms do not currently provide complete explanations and that other factors may be involved.},

In these "tag-based models", cooperators modulate cooperation according to an observable and hard-to-fake trait displayed by potential interaction partners. Socially acquired vocalizations in general, and speech accent among humans in particular, are frequently proposed as hard to fake and hard to hide traits that display sufficient cross-populational variability to reliably guide such social assortment in fission-fusion societies. Adults' sensitivity to accent variation in social evaluation and decisions about cooperation is well-established in sociolinguistic research. The evolutionary and developmental origins of these biases are largely unknown, however. Here, we investigate the influence of speech accent on 5-10-year-old children's developing social and cooperative preferences across four Brazilian Amazonian towns. Two sites have a single dominant accent, and two sites have multiple co-existing accent varieties. We found that children's friendship and resource allocation preferences were guided by accent only in sites characterized by accent heterogeneity. Results further suggest that this may be due to a more sensitively tuned ear for accent variation. The demonstrated local-accent preference did not hold in the face of personal cost. Results suggest that mechanisms guiding tag-based assortment are likely tuned according to locally relevant tag-variation. ?? 2013.},

But almost nothing is known about how different parenting and socialization practices in different cultures affect infants' and young children's earliest emerging cognitive and social-cognitive skills. In the current monograph, we report a series of eight studies in which we systematically assessed the social-cognitive skills of 1- to 3-year-old children in three diverse cultural settings. One group of children was from a Western, middle-class cultural setting in rural Canada and the other two groups were from traditional, small-scale cultural settings in rural Peru and India.In a first group of studies, we assessed 1-year-old children's most basic social-cognitive skills for understanding the intentions and attention of others: imitation, helping, gaze following, and communicative pointing.Children's performance in these tasks was mostly similar across cultural settings. In a second group of studies, we assessed 1-year-old children's skills in participating in interactive episodes of collaboration and joint attention.Again in these studies the general finding was one of cross-cultural similarity. In a final pair of studies, we assessed 2- to 3-year-old children's skills within two symbolic systems (pretense and pictorial). Here we found that the Canadian children who had much more experience with such symbols showed skills at an earlier age.Our overall conclusion is that young children in all cultural settings get sufficient amounts of the right kinds of social experience to develop their most basic social-cognitive skills for interacting with others and participating in culture at around the same age. In contrast, children's acquisition of more culturally specific skills for use in practices involving artifacts and symbols is more dependent on specific learning experiences.},

annote = {gene-culture coevolution applied to social psychology

This approach hypothesizes a norm-psychology: a suite of psychological adaptations for inferring, encoding in memory, adhering to, enforcing and redressing violations of the shared behavioral standards of one's community.

culture has shaped the human genome by driving the evolution of both our brains and bodies along trajectories not available to less cultural species.

new evidence is pushing the earliest origins of complex cultural adaptations, such as tools, manufactur- ing techniques, cooking and fire control, deeper into our evolutionary past [3–6].

We conclude that understanding human cooperation requires understand- ing culturally transmitted cooperative norms and the evolved cognitive mechanisms that generate them (Box 1)

By norms, we mean learned behavioral standards shared and enforced by a community. By norm-psychology, we mean a suite of cognitive mechanisms, motivations and dispositions for dealing with norms.

Heuristically, we par- tition these mechanisms by the selective processes that favored them: 

(i) the accumulating corpus of adaptive cultural information and the increasingly plentiful coordination opportunities it entails and 
(ii) the emergence of norm-enforcing phenotypes

a species which passes a crucial threshold of dependence on culturally transmitted information will probably evolve a norm-psychology.

We argue that large-scale coop- eration in our species is best understood as one product of culturally evolving social norms, supported by norm-psychology.

The norm-psychology account builds on these by describing evolved cognitive mechanisms that generate cross-cultural variation and cumulative cultural evolution.

How can natural selection produce dispositions for prosocial third-party condemnation [11].
(2nd order free-rider problem?)

capacity for cumulative culture involves (and then amplifies) two types of selection pressures: 

1. those associated with the acquisition of adap- tive non-social information by learning from others (e.g., which plants are toxic)

2. social behaviors or strategies that permit coordinating with conspecifics (e.g. seasonally aggregating at the same locations or using the same ges- ture when a viper is spotted).


Within the last two million years our ancestors sur-
mounted the barrier between non-cumulative social learn- ing (common in many species) and cumulative cultural evolution [12,13]:

Adaptive cultural information began gradually accumulating overgenerations, eventuallyencod- ing a phenotypic repertoire more complex and fitness-en- hancing than any single individual could discover by asocial learning alone.

Brains better at acquiring, storing and organizing this growing corpus of adaptive information had a selective advantage over their less cultural brethren.

By mathematically coupling evidence-based assumptions about ancestral environments to the constraints imposed by natural selection, culture–gene coevolutionary models explore the causes and consequences of this evolutionary transition [12,15].

These processes favored the evolution of cognitive biases for extracting ‘better quality' (more fitness enhancing) information fromthe minds and behavior of others. Much modeling work shows when and how these adaptive cognitive biases or strategies improve cultural learning [16] by discriminating content, making certain types of information easier to acquire/infer [17], or by exploiting cues of skill, success, prestige, age, sex, health, ethnicity, confidence [18–21] and trait frequency (e.g. conformist transmission, the disposition to disproportionately imitate the most common trait/behavior [22]. 

As coordination with community members came to represent an ever larger proportion of lifetime fitness, early cultural learners faced an addi- tional selection pressure to adopt the majority practices of their community.

Ever more synchronized communities, in strategies related to movements (home bases), defense, gestural communication, exchange, courting and pair- bonding (marriage) made miscoordinating ever more costly.

Of course, adopting complementary phenotypes is sometimes better than coordinating. To address this, human populations, even foragers, self-organize into marked subgroups, such as those based on sex, age, ethnicity and caste [24]

sex division of labour: "males hunt and females gather"

Sorting into subgroups transforms complementarity back into coordination. For example, a forager household might need experts on both hunting and gathering. If males hunt and females gather, well-complimented house- holds can form by individuals learning from those within their sex-based subgroups.

Coordinat- ing can generate a coevolutionary selection for an ‘ethnic psychology': a tendency for social group members to adopt arbitrary ethnic markers (e.g. dialect) and preferentially interact with and learn from people who share those markers [25], further reinforcing the degree of and pres- sure for coordination.

In this first stage, the increasing fitness-relevance of coordination creates genetic selection pressures for skill at recognizing and representing the most common behaviors, beliefs or strategies in one's community and for disposi- tions to adopt or even internalize them as proximate motivations or heuristics.

coevolutionary account of culture, coordination and
cognition also impacts cooperation:

First, the tension between the benefits of honestly sharing information and the temptation to manipulate others' culture-dependent phenotypes to one's own advantage itself represents a cooperative dilemma

The five challenges of large-scale human cooperation:

1. Scale variation: some societies lack collective action or coopera- tion beyond the extended family (little or no large-scale coopera- tion), whereas others routinely cooperate on the order of thousands or even millions of individuals. 

The norm-psychology approach proposes that social norms, which effectively harness and extend elements of our evolved social psychology (e.g. kinship), have emerged culturally over thousands of years, driven by a process involving competition among societies, organizations and institutions.

Domain variation: much ethnography and recently some experi- ments [91,92,101] indicate that the behavioral domains in which people cooperate vary dramatically from society to society. Although some groups cooperate only in warfare and fishing, others in the same ecology and with the same technology cooperate only in house-building and rituals [8]

The norm-psychology approach predicts that different groups will have different context-specific, self-re-enforcing social norms, which might or might not be cooperative

For cooperation, theoretical models strive to explain the persistence of individually costly cooperation by describing strategies which, when sufficiently common, allow cooperators to outcompete noncooperators while ‘paying' for themselves [17,31,34,35].

Fortunately, cultural evolution provides at least three
different processes to select among these different stable equilibria: (i) rational, forward-looking, calculation by in- dividuals; (ii) high levels of stochasticity (random fluctua- tions) such that stable equilibria with larger basins of attraction will emerge more frequently; and (iii) cultural group selection.

As cultural group selection increasingly guarantees that learners find themselves in social groups organized by norms that incentivize prosocial or cooperative behavior [8,23], within-group (and between-group) genetic selection processes will favor genes that build prosocial, norm-ad- hering phenotypes.

abstract = {A geographically-resolved, multi-level Bayesian model is used to analyze the data presented in the U.S. Police-Shooting Database (USPSD) in order to investigate the extent of racial bias in the shooting of American civilians by police officers in recent years. In contrast to previous work that relied on the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Reports that were constructed from self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this data set is less likely to be biased by police reporting practices. County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police are estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the race/ethnicity of the suspects/civilians. The results provide evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being {\{}black, unarmed, and shot by police{\}} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {\{}white, unarmed, and shot by police{\}} on average. Furthermore, the results of multi-level modeling show that there exists significant heterogeneity across counties in the extent of racial bias in police shootings, with some counties showing relative risk ratios of 20 to 1 or more. Finally, analysis of police shooting data as a function of county-level predictors suggests that racial bias in police shootings is most likely to emerge in police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.},

abstract = {It has been argued that the physical sensations induced by exercise, measured as the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), are distinct from the sense of effort. This study aimed to determine whether a new measure of task effort - the Task Effort and Awareness (TEA) score - is able to measure sensations distinct from those included in the conventional RPE scale. Seven well-trained cyclists completed a maximal effort 100 km time trial (TT) and a submaximal trial at 70{\%} of the power sustained during the TT (70{\%} TT). Five maximal 1 km sprints were included in both trials. Both the RPE related solely to physical sensation (P-RPE) and the TEA score increased during the TT and were linearly related. During the 70{\%} TT, both P-RPE and TEA scores increased, but TEA increased significantly less than P-RPE (p{\textless}0.001). TEA scores reached maximal values in all 1 km sprints in both the maximal TT and 70{\%} TT, whereas the RPE increased progressively, reaching a maximal value only in the final 1 km sprints in both the TT and the 70{\%} TT. These results indicate that the physical sensations of effort measured as the P-RPE act as the template regulating performance during exercise and that deviation from that template produces an increase in the sense of effort measured by the TEA score. Together, these controls ensure that the chosen exercise intensity does not threaten bodily homeostasis. Our findings also explain why submaximal exercise conducted within the constraints of the template P-RPE does not produce any conscious awareness of effort.},

Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

abstract = {High group cohesion is considered to be beneficial and lead to better performance. This qualitative case study describes a case in which high social cohesion led to a deterioration in a team's performance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between performance in a team sport and social psychological group phenomena such as cohesion, conformity, groupthink, and group polarization. The participants were members of a junior-league ice-hockey team, consisting of three adult coaches and 22 players aged 15 to 16 years. The data were derived from an interview with the main coach, continuous observation by the principal researcher, and a diary based on observations during one ice-hockey season. The Group Environment Questionnaire was used to assess group cohesion quantitatively. The qualitative data were analyzed by identifying themes that illuminated the research problem. In this study, the team did not perform as expected, and their performance deteriorated during the autumn. Social cohesion was high. In addition, the need to evaluate performance declined because of increased pressure to conform. Pressure to conform, groupthink, and group polarization increased owing to the high level of social cohesion which in turn was associated with the deterioration in the group's performance. Based on the findings it appears that high group cohesion may not always be beneficial to the team and does not necessarily lead to better performance in all situations.},

@article{Carhart-Harris2014,
abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of "primary states" is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit "criticality," i.e., the property of being poised at a "critical" point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},
annote = {Entropy is a powerful explanatory tool for cognitive neuroscience since it provides a quantitative index of a dynamic system's randomness or disorder while simultaneously describing its informational character, i.e., our uncertainty about the system's state if we were to sample it at any given time-point

When applied in the context of the brain, this allows us to make a translation between mecha- nistic and qualitative properties.

increased subjective uncertainty or “puzzlement” accompanies states of increased system entropy. These ideas are consistent with Karl Friston's free-energy principle2 and readers interested in Bayesian inference and the mechanisms by which the brain is hypothesized to minimize free-energy/surprise should consult this work (Friston, 2010).

“self-organized criticality”
how a complex system (i.e., a system with many constituting units that displays emergent properties at the global-level beyond those implicated by its individual units) forced away from equilibrium by a regu- lar input of energy, begins to exhibit interesting properties once it reaches a critical point in a relatively narrow transition zone between the two extremes of systemorder and chaos.

Three properties displayed by critical systems that are especially relevant to the present paper are: 
(1) a maximum number of “metastable” or transiently-stable states (Tognoli and Kelso, 2014),

(2) maximum sensitivity to perturbation, and (

3) a propensity for cascade-like processes that propagate throughout the system, referred to as “avalanches” (Beggs and Plenz, 2003)

There is growing evidence that brain activity, like much of nature, displays critical behav- ior (Beggs and Plenz, 2003)—and this raises some interesting questions: e.g.,

does the brain activity of healthy-adult-humans exhibit characteristics of criticality during normal waking con- sciousness, 

or

are there other states of consciousness in which these characteristics are even more pronounced?

Freud:
We focus on the ego because it is one of Freud's less abstract constructs and it is hypothesized that its dis- integration is necessary for the occurrence of primary states.

EGO - identity or personality; most simply, the ego is our “sense of self.”

Freudian metapsychology, the ego is not just a (high-level) sensation of self-hood; it is a fundamen- tal system that works in competition and cooperation with other processes in the mind to determine the quality of consciousness.

Citing recent neuroimaging findings involving the classic psychedelic drug, psilocybin, the psychedelic state is described as a prototypical high-entropy state of consciousness (i.e., higher than normal waking consciousness).

we show evidence that the brain exhibitsmore characteristics of criticality in the psychedelic state than are apparent during normal waking consciousness

Moreover, this leads to the proposal that the brain of mod- ern adult humans differs from that of its closest evolutionary and developmental antecedents because of an extended capac- ity for entropy suppression, implying that the system (i.e., the brain) gravitates away from criticality proper toward a state of slight sub-criticality.},

Ownership of an outgroup body has been found to be associated with a significant reduction in implicit biases against that outgroup. We propose that these changes occur via a process of self association that first takes place in the physical, bodily domain as an increase in perceived physical similarity between self and outgroup member. This self association then extends to the conceptual domain, leading to a generalization of positive self-like associations to the outgroup.},

Here, we asked how people deal with individual differences in competence in the context of a collective perceptual decision-making task. We developed a metric for estimating how participants weight their partner's opinion relative to their own and compared this weighting to an optimal benchmark. Replicated across three countries (Denmark, Iran, and China), we show that participants assigned nearly equal weights to each other's opinions regardless of true differences in their competence-even when informed by explicit feedback about their competence gap or under monetary incentives to maximize collective accuracy. This equality bias, whereby people behave as if they are as good or as bad as their partner, is particularly costly for a group when a competence gap separates its members.},

Using electroencephalographic oscillations as an index of perception-action-coupling, we found exactly this: participants displayed activity over motor cortex when acting and when observing ingroups act, but not when observing outgroups - an effect magnified by prejudice and for disliked groups (South-Asians, then Blacks, followed by East Asians).

abstract = {This paper introduces a model of 'theory of mind', namely, how we represent the intentions and goals of others to optimise our mutual interactions. We draw on ideas from optimum control and game theory to provide a 'game theory of mind'. First, we consider the representations of goals in terms of value functions that are prescribed by utility or rewards. Critically, the joint value functions and ensuing behaviour are optimised recursively, under the assumption that I represent your value function, your representation of mine, your representation of my representation of yours, and so on ad infinitum. However, if we assume that the degree of recursion is bounded, then players need to estimate the opponent's degree of recursion (i.e., sophistication) to respond optimally. This induces a problem of inferring the opponent's sophistication, given behavioural exchanges. We show it is possible to deduce whether players make inferences about each other and quantify their sophistication on the basis of choices in sequential games. This rests on comparing generative models of choices with, and without, inference. Model comparison is demonstrated using simulated and real data from a 'stag-hunt'. Finally, we note that exactly the same sophisticated behaviour can be achieved by optimising the utility function itself (through prosocial utility), producing unsophisticated but apparently altruistic agents. This may be relevant ethologically in hierarchal game theory and coevolution.},

abstract = {Introduction. When deciding about the cause underlying serially presented events, patients with delusions utilise fewer events than controls, showing a "Jumping-to-Conclusions" bias. This has been widely hypothesised to be because patients expect to incur higher costs if they sample more information. This hypothesis is, however, unconfirmed. Methods. The hypothesis was tested by analysing patient and control data using two models. The models provided explicit, quantitative variables characterising decision making. One model was based on calculating the potential costs of making a decision; the other compared a measure of certainty to a fixed threshold. Results. Differences between paranoid participants and controls were found, but not in the way that was previously hypothesised. A greater "noise" in decision making (relative to the effective motivation to get the task right), rather than greater perceived costs, best accounted for group differences. Paranoid participants also deviated from ideal Bayesian reasoning more than healthy controls. Conclusions. The Jumping-to-Conclusions Bias is unlikely to be due to an overestimation of the cost of gathering more information. The analytic approach we used, involving a Bayesian model to estimate the parameters characterising different participant populations, is well suited to testing hypotheses regarding "hidden" variables underpinning observed behaviours.},
annote = {Jumping to Conclusion Bias

hypothesised that probabilistic inference is defective in deluded patients. A key test used to assess such inference is the ‘‘beads in a jar'' task (Huq, Garety, {\&} Hemsley, 1988),

study participants are told that a sequence of blue (b) and green (g) beads will be drawn from one of two jars. One jar, B, has a majority of blue beads; the other jar, G, has the same majority of green beads. 

Participants are presented with beads, one by one. They are asked to think whether B or G is the underlying cause of the bead sequence and asked to declare which it is when they themselves are sure. 

The main outcome is the number of draws that participants take to decide

participants with paranoid beliefs
or other kinds of delusions take a smaller number of draws to decide than controls (Corcoran et al., 2008; Fear {\&} Healy, 1997; Garety et al., 2005; Garety, Hemsley, {\&}Wessely, 1991)

The unwarranted derivation of beliefs in paranoid thinking, as well as the precipitous decisions in probabilistic-reasoning tasks, are often attributed to increased motivation to draw conclusions, for example as part of a cognitive style geared towards detecting threats (Dudley, John, Young, {\&} Over, 1997).

Alternative Explanations:

In one variant of the task, participants are asked to give serial estimates of the chance that the beads are drawn from one specific jar, rather than to decide when to stop drawing.

subjects appear to shift their certainty estimates more than controls when presented with beads favouring the jar opposite to their currently preferred one (Fear {\&} Healy, 1997; Young {\&} Bentall, 1997). Thiswould be surprising if developing a preference for a jar involved jumping to a delusion-like conclusion, as delusions are by definition resistant to contrary evidence (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).

The ideal-observer Bayesian approach
Models of optimal decision making explicitly parametrise all the factors, including prior expectations, costs, and noise, that should control choice (Dayan {\&} Daw, 2008; Green {\&} Swets, 2008; Kording, 2007).

Decision making in ideal observer models is based on two considerations: the posterior probabilities of various scenarios, given what has been observed, and the values of different decisions (action values) for each scenario. In

Fear and Healy (1997) compared the exact Bayesian likelihoods with estimates that patients and healthy controls made in the serial-estimates version of the task. 

No clear difference was found to support the hypothesis that delusion formation is based on a deficit of estimating such probabilities. 

Therefore, analysing the factors contributing to action values may therefore be quite important:

In the version of task where paranoid patients do differ from controls,
actual choices or commitments must be made, rather than estimates of probabilities

After each sample, three choices are available: DB and DG, which decide on jars B and G respectively, and DS, i.e., ‘‘sample again''

In the decision-theory literature, these problems are called optimal stopping problems (Bertsekas, 1995; Puterman, 1994)

instructions may suggest that the subjects should weigh heavily the cost of deciding wrongly (CW). The cost that normally afflicts decision-making problems under uncertainty, namely the cost of sampling a further bead (CS), is not mentioned.

However, CS may nevertheless be important:

One factor that has often been put forward to explain delusional thinking is inflated personal cost (or value) associated with the collection of information under uncertainty.

Different instances of this ‘‘high-cost hypothesis'' in the psychology literature include 
1. the ‘‘need for closure'' reflecting a high subjective cost of uncertainty (Bentall {\&} Swarbrick, 2003), 
2. the cost to self-esteem (Bentall, 2003), or
3. the cost of cognitive dissonance experienced when intensely salient experiences strain the patient's explanatory theories about the world (Freeman {\&} Garety, 2004; Kapur, 2003).

patients may experience sampling costs to be greater than healthy people, and adopt cognitive strategies to minimise them. 

H1: paranoid participants tend to assume
higher costs of gathering more data in serial probabilistic inferencing tasks, which explains their early decisions (the high-sampling-cost hypothesis)

H2: paranoid probabilistic reasoning may deviate away from the Bayesian ideal (towards a simpler model) more than that of healthy subjects

We thus built two models for the task:

1. The first was an implementation of ideal observer Bayesian analysis, including Costs (the CB model)
--its calculation of the cost of gathering more information (sampling again) involves a broad and deep consideration of all future outcomes (highly challenging for patients, and indeed controls)

2. Our simpler model was based on the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT, see later). This treats costs in a less direct way, and is much simpler in practice.

One critical deviation from ideal that we can expect from both controls
and patients is behavioural noise (e.g., Pleskac, Dougherty, Rivadeneira, {\&} Wallsten, 2009).

Consider data from 99 trials of 33 healthy people performing the beads task that we will analyse later (Corcoran et al., 2008).

important finding was that the paranoid group had a higher
mean cognitive noise (parameter tm) than both the healthy and clinical controls and for both versions of the task (Figure 2)


Contrary to the ‘‘high sampling cost hypothesis'', we found that increased noise in decision-making accounts robustly for the JTC bias.

possibility of ‘‘reduced effective motivation'' cannot be ruled out on the basis of this study, it can be expected that paranoid patients would be highly motivated to avoid failure experiences and thus would be unlikely to have a reduced cost of making the wrong decision.

We found no evidence that paranoid participants perceive increased costs
in this task when given socially salient stimuli. 

It may still be that the anticipation of high personal costs specifically contributes to the fixity of the self-referent ideas that paranoid participants hold.

Paranoid decision making and noise
Decisions may be affected by noise in two key ways which our Bayesian modelling helps to clarify:

1. Noise directly reduces the impact of a given difference between the values of the actions on choice - ‘‘Noisy'' participants would declare more often even if faced with similar differences in action values favouring sampling again

2. early decisions in the beads task reflect smaller differences in action values favouring different actions. This is because the calculation of the action value for sampling relies on values of future states being taken into account accurately


FORWARD-THINKING: 
In both cases, there is a critical role for areas of prefrontal cortex, and specific regions of the striatum (Balleine, Liljeholm, {\&} Ostlund, 2009; Unterrainer {\&} Owen, 2006). 

The schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses associated with our paranoid group are thought to involve a relative hypofrontality, with a predisposing and/or consequent limbic hyperdopaminergia (Langdon, McKay, {\&} Coltheart, 2008; Laruelle, 2008) and such pathological processes may contribute to our findings.

Emotional factors could also contribute to the process substantially, if they involved a sense of greater proximity of threat. There is evidence that the latter shifts information processing away from frontal areas (Mobbs et al., 2007)

the psychological mechanisms causing higher ‘‘noise'', including perception of threat

High noise in itself makes cognition inefficient, or even biased, as cognitively more distant alternatives cannot be taken into account well.

Bayesian versus threshold-driven decisions in paranoia

People with paranoia may employ more often non-Bayesian reasoning, where the estimated likelihood of the cause of an event is simply compared to a threshold.

Overall, the costed-Bayesian model fits the healthy subjects better, whereas the data from paranoid subjects (and remitted) were better explained by the simpler sequential probability ratio test model, which does not involve consideration of possible future outcomes.

This would be consistent with evidence that paranoid subjects tend to revert more easily to simple heuristics (Glockner {\&} Moritz, 2008). Bayesian reasoning, however, requires considerable cognitive resources},

Distortions of self-representation contribute to major psychiatric disorders such as depression, personality disorder and paranoia

1. Introduction: Agency and the interpersonal self 

the brain as a probabilistic inference device has seen great advances in recent years (Chater {\&} Oaksford, 2008; Friston {\&} Stephan, 2007), 

allowing important aspects of the minimal and narrative self during perception and action to be considered in the light of how probabilistic prediction interacts with sensory evidence.

The computations that brains perform to predict and hypothesis-test underlie what it is like to be an I who expects the consequences of acting and perceiving – now and through time (Hohwy, 2007)

the interpersonal self is actively inferred during social exchanges and that many of its properties correspond to the means and ends of a machinery of probabilistic inference

Inferring self-representations may thus help achieve desirable ends (social outcomes).

We develop our claim as follows:

1.we provide evidence that some high-level, affectively coloured (pain) perception is well described in terms of basic Bayesian reasoning. 

2. we describe an extended framework of approximate Bayesian reasoning, namely active inference, which encompasses agency and decision-making.

3. we review the kinds of psychological construct upon which active inference may operate – and show that inferring about these constructs subserves important goals. 

4. we suggest a model of interpersonal exchange that could form the basis for empirical study. 

5. we examine the psychiatric relevance of making affectively charged inferences, especially about the self. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our approach and the implications for future research.

In a Bayesian framework what the brain minimises as it makes inferences, including inferences about the self, is unpredictability
and not, for example, proximal discomfort.

We reformulate the principle of psychological economy as follows:
the primary gain of a representation is its power to predict outcomes that matter under some prior beliefs.

Maximising predictability is equivalent to minimising surprise. 

Clearly, surprising outcomes rest upon prior beliefs. In our case, these beliefs will be about the self (and others). 

Crucially, surprise can be quantified as the negative log (Bayesian) evidence for a model. 

This means that minimising surprise maximises the evidence for a model or representation of interpersonal exchange



2.2. The Bayesian model of pain perception

In Bayesian inference, evidence that has a greater precision has more influence on beliefs.

given beliefs subjects already entertained (priors) about how painful percepts are generated, how are current percepts integrated into new beliefs (posteriors)?

‘new beliefs' include the precision or the weight that should be attached to past reports. The role of pre- cision is crucial, because agents come to rely more on cues that have the greatest precision. 

Notice that the previous response enters as a new observation in this Bayesian updating scheme – in other words, the model is observing and trying to explain its own responses.

Results:
The authors found that the full model explained the pain-perception data of placebo non-responders, but a reduced model – which neglects sensory information (ot) and makes predictions based only on past reports.

Bayesian updating thus provides a good account of behaviours involving high-level beliefs about analgesic properties. 

This example also provides proof-of-principle that apparently irrational, affectively charged human beliefs can be described quantitatively in terms of the balance of prior beliefs relative to sensory evidence.

Interpersonal interactions also involve apparently irrational, affectively charged beliefs and the related negative affect is neurally and subjectively related to pain (Eisenberger, 2012).

Neither physical pain nor social ‘pain' stand in a one-to-one relation with damage: people have widely varying sensitivities to the same physical manipulation (Eisenberger, Jarcho, Lieberman, {\&} Naliboff, 2006).

The experience of physical pain is not unrelated to self-awareness (‘Pinch me, am I dreaming?')

but interpersonal ‘pain' is quite directly related to self- and other- representation. 

Much as inferences about pain relate to the risk posed by stimuli (and, more subtly, my own physical vulnerability), 

so during interpersonal inference the self and others are vividly experienced as vulnerable (or not), noxious (or safe), etc.

silence as to the functional role of inference about pain (or, in our case, about the self).

inferences about pain depend on context: organisms can tune their own pain perception according to both their prior beliefs and the specific biological goals they believe are attainable in that context (Boureau, 2005)

This would be an irrational anomaly if pain were a raw datum, but not if pain was a motivational force: if there is little of biological use that can be done, it is better to reduce pain sensitivity.

We therefore need a Bayesian framework that explicitly represents the person's agency and goals, namely active inference (Friston et al., 2013).

In order to study self-awareness as inference, we need to quantify the relevant aspects of self- representation:

We will consider this in more detail below; for now, suffice it to say then we can cast traits like ‘fairness' or ‘jealousy' as social preferences: how much another's pain or gain can act as a motivating force (Camerer, 2003). 

We propose that such sensitivities (preferences) may stand to social outcomes as pain sensitivity stands to somatic ones. 

That is, their usefulness may lie in helping the agent reach their goals.


3. Active Bayesian inference and self-representation 

3.1. Using active inference to reach desirable goals
During active inference, however, we can entertain beliefs about alternative scenarios that lie ahead – scenarios that depend on our own fictive choices in the future.

Our ‘prior beliefs' are not just about what we believe the world to be like, but which alternative outcomes we realistically expect (hope) that we can reach: our goals. From now on we will refer to prior beliefs about goals simply as ‘goals'.

Empirical Priors: a subject has experienced part of the scenario, but has not as yet reached the final outcome (i.e. the choices that are shaped by their goals)

(a) goal attainability from the current state and 
(b) beliefs about future choices (Friston {\&} Stephan, 2007; Friston et al., 2013).

Empirical priors are a necessary aspect of inference in hierarchical models. Technically speaking, they are prior beliefs that are conditioned on (i.e. depend on) other unknown variables.

In contrast to goals, empirical priors entail beliefs about the dynamics of the task or, more simply, the consequences of a particular action in terms of the transition from one state to another: where will I end up if I take this sequence of actions?

And how does the disparity between that outcome and my goals influence my choice of a subsequent policy?

E.G.: If I take a bus towards Barnet (action), am I likely to get to a nice pub (state) and look for hot chocolate there (policy)?

In short, empirical priors entail the agent's knowledge about the dynamics of her/himself in the world.

They are ‘priors' in the sense that the actual policy that we will choose (shall I look for hot chocolate?) will depend on observations about where we are and where we can go.

Crucially, in the active inference framework, these choices will also depend on the confidence we have in reaching our goals from the current state. 

This is because action depends upon beliefs over policies and beliefs always have a precision.

is to convert the utilitarian formulation of classical economic theory, in which choices are assumed to maximise expected utility, into a pure (Bayesian) inference problem. 

representing the utility of outcomes as prior beliefs about final states:
instead of making choices to maximise expected utility, one simply minimises surprise – under the prior belief that one will end up in desirable states.

Practically, replacing utilities with prior beliefs means that one can appeal to well-established inference schemes such as (variational) free-energy minimisation in order to prescribe normative behaviour.

Casting utility functions as prior beliefs means that one can understand utility – which depends on interpersonal factors – in terms of beliefs about oneself and others.

e.g.:
assigning high utility to gains acquired by a partner who resembles me translates into holding a higher prior belief that the partner will be of a similar type to me and that they will gain from the exchange.

3.2. The nature of beliefs about the self (and others)

During self- and other-perception, empirical evidence suggests that people form beliefs about both the states and traits, of both self and others (Bem, 1972; Bentall, 2003; Fowler et al., 2006)

Traits are characteristic patterns of emotion, behaviour or thinking that subjects engage across many situations. People naturally infer such traits in each other, in order to anticipate intentional mental states.

A modern clinical research instrument, used to assess such representations, is shown in Table 1. 

The items relate to (i) (social) outcomes; e.g. ‘respected', ‘a failure'; (ii) Capabilities; e.g. ‘weak', ‘talented' and (iii) Preferences for acting according to social values; e.g. ‘good', ‘fair', ‘trustworthy'. 

If people are asked to describe ‘what kind of person' they desire to be and ‘what kind of person they try to avoid being', they give a mixture of success-, motivation- and ability-related traits for themselves too (Francis, Boldero, {\&} Sambell, 2006).

Building on the work on inferring an other's type (Ray, King-Casas, Montague, {\&} Dayan, 2008), we hypothesize that people harvest observations to update their beliefs about their own type for good reason:

Self (and other) representations are tools facilitating the efficient computation of interpersonal behaviour.

‘sociometer theory of self-esteem' (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, {\&} Downs, 1995).

According to the sociometer account, self-esteem has an important functional role, which is to indicate one's likely evaluation by the social milieu.

actions that improve self-esteem are rewarding because – if all goes well – they subserve socially sanctioned goals.

‘sociometer theory of self-representation'
Type-based interpersonal representations, of which (trait) self-esteem is only a subset, serve to optimise context-dependent social computations.

Aspects of self-representation important for prediction may be:
(i) how successful I have been in a given context so far; 
(ii) an appraisal of my capabilities; and 
(iii) what my (interpersonal) preferences are

Constructs such as ‘a bad person' or ‘fair', can inform optimal decision-making in a formal and fundamental fashion, despite the emotive and informal nature of these con- cepts.

Our contention that (interpersonal) preferences should be the object of inference parallels Hohwy's hypothesis that de- sires are inferred in the process of applying generative models of ourselves (Hohwy, 2007)

The coherence of these models would be important for the construction of the ‘narrative self'

In terms of active inference, agents can inform goals by the desirable self-representations that they are likely to reach as outcomes

‘‘If the outcome of this exchange is that I cooperate and my partner runs off with the money, this would be evidence that I am a fool. This is highly undesirable – I'll attach very low probabilities to outcomes implying that I'm a fool''.

We hypothesise that different people are equipped with different prior beliefs, acquired during their upbringing and built on a base of genetic preparedness.

This allows modelling of individual variation, including variation in psychopathology. It provides a simple and graceful way to account for different types (phenotypes) in a quantitative and formal sense.

3.3. Self-representation and desirable goals of social interaction 

Type-based representations provide a simple and formal belief space that people may use in categorising themselves and others.

These representations can be linked to the returns (e.g. utilities or prior beliefs) that people expect themselves and others to derive from social actions.

An agent's task is then to infer, or estimate, ‘types' linked to utilities:

FAIRNESS: I infer that my partner is a ‘fair person', this summarises an expectation: that they will avoid actions leading to inequitable returns for all involved – finding such actions aversive.

why bother using person-representations as heuristics? Why not just calculate out how everyone should behave based on their self-interest?

Type-based interpersonal representations can be likened to heuristics that facilitate approximate Bayesian inference

Here type-based representations can be a shortcut to tracing out a complex tree of possible future states and outcomes.

In the ‘stag hunt' game, for example, agents with limited depth-of-thought but equipped with ‘prosocial' preferences make decisions equivalent to having greater depth-of-thought but no social biases (Yoshida, Dolan, {\&} Friston, 2008).

In such cases, explicit optimal solutions are often prohibitively complicated to compute. When framed in terms of heuristics or prior beliefs, approximate Bayesian inference provides a tractable and – in some in- stances – neuronally plausible scheme for optimisation.

This approach marks a significant departure from the traditional (normative) behavioural-economic approach, where an agent's beliefs about their own type do not depend on their actions and vice versa.

It also differs from traditional psycholog- ical approaches, where self-representations – including theories based on self-esteem or on unconscious representations – are seen as the object of a more-or-less self-contained homeostasis, rather than an explicit heuristic of how to behave opti- mally in social exchanges.

3.4. Self- and other-representation in a model Trust Task
participants, in the role of the Investor, is given a certain ‘wage'. They can invest any fraction fI of that ‘wage' with the Trus- tee. The Trustee makes a profit, which is usually taken to be 200{\%}. They then keep as much of this as they want and return to the Investor any fraction fT of the ‘wage'.

How much will the Investor entrust to the Trustee? Repeated rounds allow each player to try to deduce the ‘type' of their partners.

Are they disposed to cooperate (fT {\textgreater} fI), or maybe ‘grab the money and
run' (fT?fI)? 

Behavioural studies demonstrate healthy people often ‘repair cooperation' that falters (pro-social), but patients with borderline personality drift towards the Nash equilibrium (defect), suppressing overall incomes (King-Casas et al., 2008).

The Nash equilibrium has a paranoid flavour: in this game, it says that in the last round the Trustee will ‘take the money and run', and therefore should not be trusted.

The same logic holds for the penultimate round, and so on through a process of iterative backward inference to the very first one. Therefore the Investor should never trust any money to the Trustee.

This can be used to analyse the behaviour of people who might hold unstable or distorted interper- sonal representations:

Let us consider agents who think about alternative future scenarios to a limited depth-of-thought (‘one, two steps ...') and then consider how they and their partners would ‘come across' in the long term (‘... infinity')

This gives interpersonal representations a functional role.

at the end of each round subjects have to update their own self-image based upon their actions and those of their partner.

Bayesian Attribution – Self-Representation (BASR) model:

working out each possible scenario two moves into the future enables the ‘type' of each partner at that future point to be estimated (Fig. 1).

1. Let's allow them just two options in each round of 30 rounds, a high (cooperative) or low (uncooperative) contribution Fhigh or Flow.

2. agents hold beliefs about how ‘cooperative' each player is, i.e. the player's types

3. agents estimate the likely evolution of the game a small number of moves into the future – e.g. ‘I play X, she plays Y, then I play Z'.

"Agents also have a sense of how precise their prediction of reaching their goals may be; this ‘precision' is important for the mechanics of active inference but outside the scope of this review."

the player whose turn it is to play infers an updated view of the interaction.

This maximises the consistency between their prior beliefs about the world, their observations, their goals, their confidence (precision) in reaching those goals – and of course their policy.

4. Clinical importance
4.1. The interpersonal self in psychiatric disorders
Severe psychiatric disorders often illustrate terrible distortions and deficits in self-perception

MIND-BLINDNESS:
As we saw, placebo responders are charac-
terised by the absence of a term reporting sensory information about the outside world (no term in ys,t?1 in Eq. (1)).

There are indications that people with borderline personality disorder may have an analogous but more subtle deficit in interpersonal interaction:

When interpersonal Trust falters they fail to ‘signal' to their opponent, by risking part of their income, that they are trustworthy.

This leads to an unravelling of trust

healthy people playing borderline partners display a reduced level of theory-of-mind, as would be expected if the borderline partner were deficient in higher-order theory-of-mind terms (Xiang et al., 2012)

The ‘missing term' in these patients' model of the world would be exactly ‘‘what sort of person would these actions make Me?'' We thus have a computational neuroscience counterpart of the clinical concept of ‘mind- blindness'.

Estimation of social threat and opportunity using active inference requires not only prior beliefs about self and others, but also their approximate Bayesian updating – including the evaluation of alternative future scenarios.

Several cognitive deficits and biases, such as mildly reduced IQ and working memory or a ‘jumping to conclusions' cognitive style, are associated with paranoid psychosis (Bentall et al., 2009).

Affective biases are likely to involve prior beliefs about the nature and likelihood of noxious states in self and others.

The cognitive-deficit part of this would be analogous to the way that play can shift from cooperative to non-cooperative under the influence of reduced depth-of-thought (Yoshida et al., 2008).

Paranoia may result from prior beliefs about self and others that are activated by specific, aversive contexts – and maintained by a reduced cognitive ability to consider more complicated but benign scenarios.

5.1. The embarrassment of Bayesian riches
Active inference assumes that subjects optimise a probabilistic representation of the environment. This assumption is not one of perfect or rational behaviour but of a type of bounded rationality based upon a potential universe of prior beliefs or heuristics.

Is ‘deviant' behaviour the result of inefficient model optimisation or due to an ‘inefficient' model of the world? In other words, are prior beliefs (the model) abnormal, or is psychopathology the result of ‘broken' active inference? This is a partic- ularly important and challenging question as on the one hand, any behaviour can be explained as optimal Bayesian inference given some set of priors and utility function; while some behaviours are undoubtedly the result of what we may call ‘broken' active inference. Examples of the latter are likely to include drug-induced psychosis or dementia},

abstract = {Evidence for successful socio-cognitive training in typical adults is rare. This study attempted to improve Theory of Mind (ToM) and visual perspective taking in healthy adults by training participants to either imitate or to inhibit imitation. Twenty-four hours after training, all participants completed tests of ToM and visual perspective taking. The group trained to inhibit their tendency to imitate showed improved performance on the visual perspective-taking test, but not the ToM test. Neither imitation training, nor general inhibition training, had this effect. These results support a novel theory of social cognition suggesting that the same self-other discrimination process underlies imitation inhibition and perspective taking. Imitation, perspective taking and ToM are all pro-social processes - ways in which we reach out to others. Therefore, it is striking that perspective taking can be enhanced by suppressing imitation; to understand another, sometimes we need, not to get closer, but to pull away. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In other words, we need to belong. In this article, I explore the developmental origins of our need to belong. I discuss existing evidence that, from early in development, children seek to affiliate with others and to form long-lasting bonds with their group members. Furthermore, when children are deprived of a sense of belonging, it has negative consequences for their well-being. This focus on social motivation enables us to examine why and in what circumstances children engage in particular behaviours. It thus provides an important complement to research on social cognition. In doing so, it opens up important questions for future research and provides a much-needed bridge between developmental and social psychology. 1.},

@article{Hollander-Blumoff,
abstract = {Criminal law, by design, assigns culpability for intentional, volitional action. Criminal law theory and criminal law doctrine thus both place an important emphasis on an individual's ability to control his or her behavior. Mostly, the law presumes that individuals can exercise self-control; in special cases, culpability and punishment are lessened because of impaired self- control. Yet despite this central role for self-control, previous scholarship has not examined the implications for criminal law of decades of research in social psychology. This Article presents and explores the implications of the most important fmdings of recent social psychology research on self-control: first, that individuals think about their actions differently depending on the temporal frame of the potential behavior in ways that often impede self-control efforts, and second, that self-control is a finite resource that can be depleted by other actions and events. The robust findings about when and how individuals are able to exercise control over their behavior help to make sense of criminal law doctrine's refusal to consider abstract questions of free will in favor of a focus on whether individuals' actions were under their control on a particular occasion. Additionally, the differences in how psychology and law conceptualize self-control failure, with psychology offering a far broader definition of these instances, demonstrate just how much the law's theoretical conceptions of self-control failure are normative and socially constructed, rather than positive and observational. The psychology of self-control has important implications for our understanding of the behavior that leads to particular criminal conduct and our conceptions of appropriate punishment.},

abstract = {Over our evolutionary history, humans have faced the problem of how to create and maintain social bonds in progressively larger groups compared to those of our primate ancestors. Evidence from historical and anthropological records suggests that group music-making might act as a mechanism by which this large-scale social bonding could occur. While previous research has shown effects of music making on social bonds in small group contexts, the question of whether this effect 'scales up' to larger groups is particularly important when considering the potential role of music for large-scale social bonding. The current study recruited individuals from a community choir that met in both small (n = 20 - 80) and large (a 'megachoir' combining individuals from the smaller subchoirs n = 232) group contexts. Participants gave self-report measures (via a survey) of social bonding and had pain threshold measurements taken (as a proxy for endorphin release) before and after 90 minutes of singing. Results showed that feelings of inclusion, connectivity, positive affect, and measures of endorphin release all increased across singing rehearsals and that the influence of group singing was comparable for pain thresholds in the large versus small group context. Levels of social closeness were found to be greater at pre- and post-levels for the small choir condition. However, the large choir condition experienced a greater change in social closeness as compared to the small condition. The finding that singing together fosters social closeness - even in large contexts where individuals are not known to each other - is consistent with evolutionary accounts that emphasize the role of music in social bonding, particularly in the context of creating larger cohesive groups than other primates are able to manage.},

For example, when two people move a piece of furniture together, there is a requirement for them to work in concert and there are mechanisms by which they are able to coor- dinate their actions. A defining characteristic of such a scenario is that each person must adjust to some aspect(s) of the intentions, action plans, and movements of the other (Clark 1996). This is a fundamentally different situation from that in which a person acts in isolation to achieve a goal. Accordingly, the ‘experimental quarantine' approach (Richardson et al. 2008) of studying isolated individuals that has guided the majority of cognitive (neuro-)science research has been giving way to studies of social interaction that try to do justice to the complexity of interpersonal cognition and action.

In order to satisfy these three desiderata, we propose a minimal framework, the core of which is an analysis of the minimal structure of situations which can elicit a sense of commitment.

abstract = {Studies on the neural bases of action perception have largely focused on the perception of individual actions. Little is known about perception of joint actions where two or more individuals coordinate their actions based on a shared intention. In this fMRI study we asked whether observing situations where two individuals act on a shared intention elicits a different neural response than observing situations where individuals act on their independent parallel intentions. We compared the neural response to perceptually identical yet intentionally ambiguous actions observed in varying contexts. A dialog between two individuals conveyed either a shared intention or two independent parallel intentions. The dialogs were followed by an identical video clip where the two individuals performed certain actions. In one task condition participants tracked the intentions of the actors, in the other, they monitored moving colored dots placed on the same videos. We found that in the intention task versus the color task, observing joint actions based on shared intentions activated the temporal poles, precuneus, and the ventral striatum compared to observing interactions based on parallel intentions. Precuneus and the temporal poles are thought to support mental state reasoning, the latter with a more specific role in retrieving memories associated with social scripts. Activation in the ventral striatum, an area involved in reward processing, likely indicates a hedonistic response to observed shared intentional relations similarly to those experienced when personally sharing mental states with others.},

annote = {study reported by de Guzman et al. [1], participants who had per-
formed a training task that required performing movements opposite to the ones performed by a model subsequently showed signs of increased empathy

seems to suggest that increasing con- trol over self and other representations may increase empathy.

distinguishing between self and other is helpful because it serves to reduce egocentric bias.

While this may be a plausible mechanism when it comes to appreciating differences in beliefs and perspectives, it is unclear how exactly making a distinction between one's own and another's actions could increase empathy.

One possibility is that the key process involved is about increasing other-related activations, rather than the control of self and other representations as such.

This interpretation is in line with findings suggesting that blurring self–other boundaries and increas- ing identification with another's body or actions can modulate social cognition [5].

For example, Maister et al. [6]: implicit attitudes towards out-group members became more positive after participants underwent a rubber hand manipulation that made an out-group hand feel like their own.

The more participants experienced ownership over the out-group hand, the more their implicit attitudes changed.

It is possible that the training task used by de Guzman et al. had the effect of making participants pay more attention to the model's hand as they had to rely on the observed actions to pre- pare for performing opposite actions

Previous research cited also found an effect of training in themotor domain onperformance in the cog- nitive domain, on a visual perspective-taking task [7].

it remains to be seenwhether these effects aremulti-directional, so that training in affective or cognitive domains could impact upon each other or even impact on the motor domain.

The literature on agency, the experience of controlling one's actions, indeed suggests that there may be unique mechanisms that serve to distinguish the (motor) actions of selfand other [9]

joint action, where several actors coordinate their actions to achieve common goals, requires both keeping one's own and others' contributions apart and planning one's own part in relation to others' [10].

This research has drawn attention to phenomena that do not clearly fit into one dis- tinct category, such as task co-representation.

This is the phenomenon that participants acting jointly together on a task often demonstrate interference from the other person's role in the task, even if this is completely irrelevant to their own role [11].

Four- to five-year-old children have also been shown to produce these effects [12,13], although 2- to 3-year-olds did not do so [12].

Cognitive co-representation:
One possibility is that the action being performed by the partner is represented, which results in motor mirroring by the actor. 

However, this may not be the whole story, as co-representation occurs when a partner is absent but believed to be acting in another room [14] and when the partner's actions are hidden from view ([12], experiments 1 and 2), suggesting a more cognitive representation of the task rather than direct perception-action links only

one suggestion from Wenke et al. [15] is that participants represent not what their partner is doing (either through a direct perception-action link or through a cognitive representation of the action or goal required for the task), but when it is their turn to act, highlighting the importance of self–other distinction in avoiding interference from a joint actor.

More recent data [16] have found further support for the role of self–other distinction in co-representation:

an individual difference study looking at the relationship between children's co-representation in a joint task and their performance on measures of general executive function and Theory of Mind.

Results show a positive relationship between performance on explicit Theory of Mind tasks and the ability to avoid interference from a partner during a joint task

which is argued to show a role of the self–other conflict resolution component of Theory of Mind 

This relationshipwas independent of a relationship between general inhibitory control capacity and interference avoidance, suggesting a specific role of self–other conflict resolution on joint task performance over and above general inhibitory control.

The link between studies of DYADIC interaction versus GROUP interaction.

Whereas the research cited and carried out by de Guzman et al. and Steinbeis focuses on mech- anisms and their development between two individuals, Over [3] and McAuliffe {\&} Dunham [4] place social cognition in a group setting, highlighting the importance of considering mechanistic explanations of social cognition within a societal framework including motivational and evolutionary factors.

Over argues that much of our social cognitive behaviour stems from a need to belong, which is clearly in place from early in ontogeny

Whereas these authors have underlined the importance of being able to keep self and other separate, Over's paper raises the question of whether this is always opti- mal in social interaction. Instead, it may be that under certain circumstances we need to experience less of a distinction between ourselves and our social group, in order to feel a sense of belonging to that group [18].

This could apply in any of the three domains mentioned above:
- In the cognitive domain, if all members of a group take the same perspective on a scenario, it may be easier to reach a joint decision regarding a course of action.

Clearly, this will not work in all cases and in some circumstances it may be more beneficial to have multiple viewpoints within a group, raising questions about self–other distinction, conformity and group decision-making [19]

Likewise, in the affective domain, a breakdown of self–other discrimination may have effects on group cohesion in that if all members feel the same emotion simultaneously they may feel a greater sense of belongingness and act in more coordinated ways [20].

In this case, we may wish to discriminate between empathy and emotion contagion, the difference between which may in fact rely on self–other distinction.

Our understanding of the role of self–other distinction for group cohesion would benefit frominvestigation within larger-scale interactions.

We may also question how the mechanisms outlined for dyadic interactions may be situated within group scenarios

do group interactions consist of many different relations between individuals, or does the group have its own mechanisms for interactingwith other groups?

McAuliffe {\&} Dunham argue for a ‘mere preferences' account of group dynamics, whereby we are inclined to like and consequently give preferential treatment to members of our own social groups because we have a preference in general for things that are associated with ourselves.

This would mean that others in our social group are merely extensions of our rep- resentation of our self, and thus are just another part of the information that needs to be kept separate from representa- tions of the ‘other' (presumably members of an out-group)

However, it could also be the case that the group is rep- resented as an entity of its own, so that representations of relations between groups dominate over representations of inter-individual relations.

For example, Tsai et al. [21] demon- strated a phenomenon known as the GROOP effect, whereby participants experience a tendency to imitate observed move- ments of two hands performing a finger-tapping routine on a computer screen. However, this imitation tendency only occurred when the number of actors on the screen (i.e. one person using both hands versus two people each using one hand) corresponded with the number of participants acting on the task, suggesting that participants entered a ‘we-mode' [22]

whereby they identified themselves with the individual when acting as an individual but as a group when actingas agroup(see also [23]).

It may be, for example, that self–other distinction originates in the motor domain, where children first learn about self and other from automatic mimicry or mirroring of a carer, which develops into mirror self-recognition and later generalizes to higher level domains such as explicit perspective-taking (see [29]).

implicit perspective-taking, emotion contagion and motor mimicry feature a more blurred rep- resentation of self and other, and later develop into more complex abilities such as explicit perspective-taking, empathy and task sharing and coordination.


If training is unidirectional from the motor domain to cognitive and affective domains, this leaves open the possibility that a hierar- chy is in place whereby higher level self–other distinction emerges bottom-up from the need to keep the actions of self and other apart. 

if training is bidirectional, this lends force to the argument that self–other distinction is an umbrella mechanism for successful processing in all social domains.

For example, in the motor domain it is possible that representations of actions and effects are first formed in an agent-neutral format and only later are agent roles assigned if necessary for the task [33]

More recent studies have begun to look at performance in task-sharing paradigms [37,38], which should provide a new avenue of research looking at self–other monitoring within interactive, coordinated tasks rather than more passive scenarios involving longer time-scales.

Additionally, certain aspects of self-representation are thought to be factors in psy- chiatric conditions that come with deficits in social cognition, such as schizophrenia...

In one study, schizophrenic patients failed to show a task co-representation effect, unlike typical controls [39], which was explained as being due to a lack of self–other integration.

This suggests that not only self– other distinction but also self–other integration is important for social cognition.

research focusing on dyadic versus group cognition, the latter of which could benefit from generalization of dyadic self–other distinction theories to groups.},

abstract = {There has recently been interest in the ways in which coordinated movements encourage coactors to feel socially closer to one another, but this has generally overlooked the importance of necessary precursors to this joint action. Here we target two low-level behaviours involved in social coordination that may mediate a relationship between joint actions and social bonding, namely joint attention and shared goals. Participants engaged in a simple reaction time task while sitting next to a partner performing the same task. In a joint attention condition, both participants attended to stimuli presented on the same half of a computer screen, while in a control condition, they attended to opposite sides of the computer screen. Shared goals were manipulated by giving participants the instruction to keep below a threshold score for both individual response times and accuracy (individual goal), or their joint mean response time and accuracy (i.e., averaging their mean response time and accuracy with that of their partner: shared goal). Attending to the same side of the screen led to higher ratings on a composite social bonding index directed towards a partner, while shared goals did not cause any effects on partner ratings. Joint attention was sufficient to encourage social closeness with an interaction partner, which suggests that any activities which encourage attending to the same point in space could have some influence on how connected coactors feel about one another.},

Social facilitation research has demonstrated that sitting next to another person and performing a similar task can have beneficial effects on performance compared with acting alone, or when performing a different task from that person (Bockler, Knoblich, {\&} Sebanz, 2011, 2012; 2012; Tsai, Kuo, Jing, Hung, {\&} Tzeng, 2006)

Social facilitation effects can be influenced by judgments made about an interaction partner (e.g., Hommel, Colzato, {\&} van den Wildenberg, 2009), and it is likely that engaging in a task at the same time as another person might reciprocally influence the social evaluation of that person.


MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF COORDINATED MOVEMENT:
to coordinate movements with another person in most natural settings, the minimum requirement is tobothattendto thesameexternalsourceandreact tothis source.

This joint attention process is inherently social in nature and plays a major part in the establishment of the first interactive relationships in childhood (Tomasello, 1995; Tomasello {\&} Carpenter, 2007). Therefore,

Second, when engaging in joint action-based activities, individuals must share the goal of executing this specific joint action in order for social coordination to be achieved

As sharing a goal has been associated with the formation of socialbonds (e.g.,Tomasello, Carpenter, Call,Behne,{\&}Moll,2005;Tomasello {\&}Rakoczy, 2003), this might also play a major part inthe establishing social bonds through joint action-based activities.

In summary, as joint attention and shared goals can both influence partner evaluation (e.g., Bayliss et al., 2013; Reddish et al., 2013), it is important to test the limits of these effects, and whether the interaction between the two could have social consequences similar to those demonstrated for joint action in general.
Joint

Joint attention and social bonding:
developmental process of social learning (Butterworth {\&} Cochran, 1980; Carpenter {\&} Nagell, 1998; Mundy {\&} Gomes, 1998)

To learn behaviour from a parent, children must be capable of attending to the same point in space and this becomes one of the first forms of social interaction that develops (Tomasello, 1995; Tomasello {\&} Carpenter, 2007)

Attending to the same space is thus a very basic building block for social learning and might therefore be expected to enhance social relationships between adults who are engaged in such an activity


GAZE:
Throughout life, there is a very strong automatic tendency to follow the gaze of other
people (Ricciardelli, Bricolo, Aglioti,{\&}Chelazzi, 2002; Xu, Zhang,{\&}Geng, 2011), and this shared gaze is linked to positive evaluation of objects (Bayliss, Paul, Cannon, {\&} Tipper, 2006)

and positive evaluation of the person with whom gaze is shared (Bayliss et al., 2013)

Gaze therefore continues to be an important social cue into adulthood, and it is likely that any shared attention to an external object could have similar effects.

Importantly, evidence suggests that attending to the gaze of another person is influenced by top-down beliefs about the agent involved:

e.g., 
- if they are perceived to be receiving visual information: Teufel, Alexis, Clayton, {\&} Davis, 2010; or 

- perceived to be a computer rather than a human: Wiese, Wykowska, Zwickel, {\&} Muller, 2012; Wykowska, Wiese,Prosser, {\&} Muller, 2014).

This suggests that awareness of the gaze of another person engages social cognitive processes rather than gaze following having only a bottom-up influence driven by external stimuli

JOINT ATTENTION:
joint attention has been described as merely two or more individuals coordinating attention towards a third object (e.g., Bakeman{\&}Adamson, 1984), some communication channel between the two individuals is a requirement for this attention to be described as ‘joint' (e.g., Carpenter{\&}Call, 2013)

(Practically, there is likely tobe a continuumbetweenattending tothe same object without any knowledge that the experience is shared and true joint attention, with a relatively arbitrary distinction drawn between the two.)

sharing an attentional focus with other individuals causes more elaborate processing of the jointly attended object, increased memory of that object, and increased relevance attribution of that object (Eskenazi, Doerrfeld, Logan, Knoblich, {\&} Sebanz, 2013; He, Lever, {\&}Humphreys, 2011; Shteynberg, 2010; Shteynberg{\&}Galinsky, 2011)

the social consequences of sharing an attentional focus have remained largely unstudied

attending the same space concerned emotional amplification towards an object caused when the object was attended to by several individuals at once (Shteynberg, Hirsh, Galinsky,{\&}Knight, 2014)

Sharing goals and social bonding
In real instances of joint action, peoplewhoare interactingwith one another often have a shared goal, for example, when working a two-handed wood saw

no consistency about whether participants are instructed to 
- follow some arbitrary goal unrelated to that of the person moving in time with them (Hove{\&}Risen, 2009) 
- given a shared goal with a partner (Wiltermuth{\&}Heath, 2009), or the 
- specific goal to coordinate with a partner (e.g., Miles, Nind, Henderson, {\&} Macrae, 2010)

Without a specific manipulation of the goals that are shared, and the experience of success that may occur as a consequence, it is unclear to what extent this might influence the social closeness experienced in experiments of this type

It is well now established that having shared, or superordinate, goals decrease social
stereotyping and thereby intergroup conflict (Sherif, 1958). However, decreased intergroup conflict does not necessarily imply increased social bonding

More recent research has demonstrated that shared goals can influence social bonding (Reddish et al., 2013), but in this experiment participants were explicitly told to work together, rather than being given the instruction to achieve a shared objective. 

the current instructions were intended to give a minimal level of shared goal and did not include any mechanism by which participants could identify their degree of shared success.

HYPOTHESES:
Hypothesis 1: Joint attention during a joint action task will encourage social closeness between strangers.
Hypothesis 2: Having a common goal in a joint action task will encourage social closeness between strangers

PROCEEDURE:
Trials on a cognitive reaction task

Joint attention: To induce the experience of joint or disjoint attention, we manipulated the focus of the participants' visual field by cueing them to either the same or different parts of the screen. 

Whenever participants engaged in a joint attention session, their initials were presented on the same side of the screen as the initials of the other participant, thus indicating they had to respond to the same stimuli.

individual goal condition were told that they should aim to achieve a maximumtarget response time of 300 ms and a response accuracy of at least 95{\%}.

shared goal condition, participantswere told that their response times and accuracy scores would be averaged with those of the participant sitting next to them and that their joint goal was to get an average response time of300 msand an average accuracy score of 95{\%}

Controls: to prevent between-participant competitiveness, participants in the shared goal condition were told that their individual scores would only be compared with the target score and not to the scores of their fellow participants. Finally, to prevent effects caused by (perceived) task performance, participants only received feedback on their performance after the experiment was finished.
Dependent

Dependent Variable: Social bonding composite measure
which consisted of eight different questions that were answered on a 100-point Likert scale.

We asked participants 
- ‘How much did do you like the other participant?' (0 = not at all, 100 = a lot), 
- ‘To what extent do you think the other participant is liked by others?' (0 = not at all, 100 = a lot), 
- ‘How positively do you feel about the other participant?' (0 = very negatively, 100 is very positively), 
- ‘How much do you trust the other participant?' (0 = not at all, 100 = very much), 
- ‘To what extent did you connect with the other participant?' (0 = not at all, 100 = very much), 
- ‘If you had to do a similar task again, how would you feel about doing it once more with this specific participant?' (0 = I'd prefer doing it with someone else, 100 = I'd prefer doing it with the same person), 
‘- To what extent did you feel cooperative towards the participant sitting next to you?'(0 = not at all, 100 = very cooperative), 
and finally 
- the Inclusion of the Other in the Self scale (IOS; Aron, Aron, {\&} Smollan, 1992).

RESULTS:

Social Bonding
Main effect of joint-attention on social bonding: 

"the Bayesian credible interval of the contrast comparing the attention condition cells did not overlap with zero (95{\%} HDI:?5.99,?.59; see Figure 3a). The estimated mean bonding score of participants was therefore between .6 and 6 points higherwhenrating their joint attentiontask partner (M = 49.5,SD = 12.4) compared with their disjoint attention task partner (M = 46.2,SD = 11.0). As the bonding composite score had a scale of 0 to 100, an estimated .6 to 6 point difference between the joint and disjoint attention condition can be interpreted as small, which is not surprising given the subtletyof the attentionmanipulation. Weinterpret this effect assupport for our hypothesis concerning the facilitative role of joint attention in social bonding."

DISCUSSION:
These results imply that relatively low-level constituent parts of coordinated social behaviours can have consequences for bonding experienced between people.


Joint Attention
Participantswere specifically instructed not to talk or otherwise communicate with each other, thus limiting the potential social feedback during the task. It is therefore significant to find even a small, yet consistent effect of joint attention on social bonding (c.f., Carpenter {\&} Call, 2013; Shteynberg et al., 2014).

the experience of sharing an attentional field with another individual increases perceptions of bondedness with this individual even when the degree to which this experience is actually shared cannot be verified through social feedback.

The question remains on what level this social bonding effect occurs?
Explanations:
1. joint attention elicits a social categorization heuristic, similar to a minimal-group paradigm effect in which individuals withwhomone shares an attentional focus are perceived to be inone's group,whereas individualswhose attentionis disjoint fromone's attentional focus are categorizedas non-ingrouporoutgroup(e.g., Tajfel, Billig,Bundy,{\&}Flament,1971)

2. An alternative explanation involving higher order cognitive processes is that the awareness of sharing an attentional field with an interaction partner induces additional higher order social cognitive processes such as mentalizing, which could facilitate the formation of social attributions to an unknown individual, increasing perceptions of social closeness.


3. joint attention induces a stronger intentional stance (Wykowska et al., 2014):

individuals do not engage in higher order mentalizing processing per se, but adopt a pair of social ‘goggles' through which their attention is drawn towards social information and through which information is more readily interpreted as social information (i.e., pre-processing it for social interpretation)

Shared Goal
Contrary to our expectations and previous research on similar phenomena (e.g., Reddish et al., 2013), the shared goal condition did not yield an independent effect on social bonding.

One possible explanation is low statistical power in the current sample.

However, this also seems unlikely, as the shared goal manipulation did yield a behavioural effect in terms of response times.

This implies that the shared goal manipulation was to some degree internalized by the participants, but did not result in higher levels of perceived closeness to the interaction partner.

perhaps joint success is more important in social bonding than shared goals.

Experience of success has previously been shown to play an important role in the social bonding effects of synchronization (Launay et al., 2013), and 

previous experiments that have manipulated shared goals allowed people to experience shared success through observation of one another's actions (Reddish et al., 2013).

Cognitively, it seems likely that sharing success with another person (i.e., experiencing positive feedback together) would have important implications for social relationships because it would encourage seeking out that positive reinforcement in future.

While shared goals might be expected to have some effects on social bonding in groups of peoplewho have chosen to work together, it is possible that they have less effectwhen the goals are provided by a third partywithwhom individuals have no relationship (e.g., an experimenter).

Further experiments could independently manipulate instructed and uninstructed goals as well as the role of task feedback (i.e., success, failure or no feedback) to further elucidate the current result.


Joint action and social bonding
studying the low-level implicit processes inherent to joint action is vital in understanding the social bonding mechanics of large- scale social bonding activities.

It is possible that social bonding in joint action is merely the product of a series of repeated low-level implicit social bonding processes required to attain behavioural coordination

While each of these might have very minor effects on how close we feel to people with whom we engage, the combination of many different processes can eventually allow a significant additive development of social bonds.

This would, for example, explain why behavioural synchrony is a form of coordination that is highly effective in evoking these implicit social bonding dynamics: the high level of precision required for synchrony provides very accurate cues from which the social dynamics within a group of individuals can be inferred.},

abstract = {For effective social interactions with other people, information about the physical environment must be integrated with information about the interaction partner. In order to achieve this, processing of social information is guided by two components: a bottom-up mechanism reflexively triggered by stimulus-related information in the social scene and a top-down mechanism activated by task-related context information. In the present study, we investigated whether these components interact during attentional orienting to gaze direction. In particular, we examined whether the spatial specificity of gaze cueing is modulated by expectations about the reliability of gaze behavior. Expectations were either induced by instruction or could be derived from experience with displayed gaze behavior. Spatially specific cueing effects were observed with highly predictive gaze cues, but also when participants merely believed that actually non-predictive cues were highly predictive. Conversely, cueing effects for the whole gazed-at hemifield were observed with non-predictive gaze cues, and spatially specific cueing effects were attenuated when actually predictive gaze cues were believed to be non-predictive. This pattern indicates that (i) information about cue predictivity gained from sampling gaze behavior across social episodes can be incorporated in the attentional orienting to social cues, and that (ii) beliefs about gaze behavior modulate attentional orienting to gaze direction even when they contradict information available from social episodes.},

@article{Vesper2012,
abstract = {When two or more individuals intend to achieve a joint outcome, they often need to time their own actions carefully with respect to those of their coactors. Online perceptual feedback supports coordination by allowing coactors to entrain with and predict each other's actions. However, joint actions are still possible when no or little online feedback is available. The current study investigated the interplay between higher-level planning processes and motor simulation in a joint action task where online feedback was not available. Pairs of participants performed forward jumps (hops) next to each other with the instruction to land at the same time. They could neither see nor hear each other, but were informed about their own and the partner's jumping distance beforehand. The analysis of basic movement parameters showed that participants adjusted the temporal and spatial properties of the movement preparation and execution phase of their jumps to the specific difference in distance between themselves and their partner. However, this adaptation was made exclusively by the person with the shorter distance to jump, indicating a distribution of coactors' efforts based on task characteristics. A comparison with an individual bipedal coordination condition suggests that joint coordination might rely on similar principles as interlimb coordination. These findings are interpreted within a framework of motor simulation.},
annote = {DISTRIBUTION:
Task distribu- tion could be an effective coordination strategy that facilitates joint action coordination (Vesper et al., 2010) and serves to prevent impairments in synchronization due to overadaptation.

a correlation analysis showed that the more participants adjusted to the difference in distance when their own jump was the shorter one, the less they adjusted when their jump was the longer one, suggesting individual differences in the extent to which coactors engaged in role distribution.

also coactors with the farther jump contributed to coordination by speeding up their movement preparation phase. 

In contrast to the adaptations of the person with the closer jump, however, this speeding was general, that is, not specific to the difference in distance between own and other's jumps

We have recently found similar evidence for general speeding in a joint coordination study in which pairs of participants were instructed to perform a visual two-choice reaction time task, either in synchrony or in close temporal succession (Vesper, van der Wel, Knoblich {\&} Sebanz, 2011)

Participants initiated their jumps faster in the farther relation, when coordination was more challenging, than baseline jumps with the same distance to jump, which were easier to coordinate.3
This suggests that speeding functioned as a
coordination strategy that is particularly relevant for difficult coordination tasks (Vesper et al., 2010).

MOVEMENT PREPARATION:
movement execution phase, the important
finding is that it was modulated in the same way as the movement preparation phase.

Participants with the shorter distance to cover jumped longer, higher, and farther, the longer the distance to be covered by their partner was

Again, participants who performed the longer, more effortful jump did not show any specific modulation by the distance difference to their partner's jump.

These results suggest that participants performing the easier part that allowed for adjustments based on their partner's jump engaged in a motor simulation of the partner's jump at the same time as planning their own movement

The modulation of one's own jump by the other's jump is in line
with theories postulating common representations of imagined, perceived and planned actions (e.g., Prinz, 1997).

evidence of motor simulation during action anticipation (Kil- ner et al., 2004; Kourtis et al., 2010) and imagination (Grezes {\&} Decety, 2001; Ramnani {\&} Miall, 2005)

our findings suggest that motor simulation during joint action planning takes place in the service of temporal prediction.

despite the lack of online perceptual information, participants had sufficient prior information about their partner's action to feed into their predictive forward models.

Participants knew precisely which distance their partner had to cover and so they could initiate a simulation of their partner's jump that allowed them to time their own jump so as to minimize the asynchrony in landing times.

One could argue that the modulations observed during the execution phase simply reflect participants' use of general heuristics rather than motor simulation processes. 

For instance, if par- ticipants reasoned that jumping higher could be a useful means to compensate for the difference in jumping distance to their partner, they could have altered their jumps intentionally

Results do not support this:
First of all, a correlation analysis with MO and MT showed that these two parameters were not related. 

Participants did not seem to adapt their movement preparation and execution time on a trial- by-trial basis which would be expected if they intentionally jumped higher on trials where they did not wait long enough to make up for the distance difference to their partner

Second, given the large number of combinations of different jump distances for the two participants (16 in total) it seems challenging, if not impossible, to apply a cognitive strategy that leads to the consistent and fine grained adaptations on a timescale of tens of milliseconds that we have observed.

Third, none of the jump parameters changed over the course of the experiment. 

This implies that coactors did not need to learn the partner's temporal jump char- acteristics based on the feedback at landing. 

Instead, they could immediately do the task, possibly by relying on existing internal models for their own jumping (Repp {\&} Knoblich, 2004).

Finally, participants never mentioned the active modulation of jump exe- cution parameters in postexperiment debriefing interviews, al- though most reported that they intentionally delayed the time of initiating their movements.

Thus, the effects observed in the jump execution phase are most likely not brought about intentionally, but occur because of the active simulation of the partner's jump during movement planning.

An additional aim of the study: investigate similarities and differences between joint and individual bipedal jumping

With respect to movement preparation, the results of the individual bipedal condition closely resemble those of the joint condition. 

The movement onset of the leg covering the shorter distance was adapted to the distance difference between the two legs.

This distribution of tasks made perfect sense for an individual given that both hands are controlled by a single motor system.

By distributing the coordination effort like this, only one hand's movements needed to be carefully controlled with respect to timing. 

If both hands would adapt to each other, this would likely require more computational effort (Konvalinka et al., 2010). 

The same is true for our individual bipedal condition, where delaying the movement onset of the leg that jumped the shorter distance was likely more efficient than distributing the coordination effort over both legs.

Whereas the similarity between joint and interlimb coordination
is striking with regard to the movement preparation phase, there was a profound difference in the coordination pattern during the movement execution phase:

In the joint condition, coactors showed the same distribution of the coordination effort in prepar- ing and executing their jumps, so that the individual with the shorter jump adjusted to the distance to be covered by the individual with the longer jump, but not vice versa

However, in the execution phase of the individual bipedal jumping condition, movement times and jump heights of both legs were affected by the distance difference such that they jumped slower, higher, and farther the larger the difference in distance between them.

(Jumping is a ballistic movement, arm-aiming is non-ballistic):
As the two legs of one individual are biomechanically coupled, they are not as independent from each other during a ballistic jumping movement as one individual's two hands or two separate persons.

Therefore, interlimb coordination of ballistic movements is a case where distributing the coordination effort asymmetrically across effectors would actually be very effortful or even impossible because individuals would need to overcome the natural biome- chanical constraints of their body.

Given the availability of motor commands within one system in the individual bipedal condition and the biomechanical linkages


The present study indi- cates that interpersonal coordination resembles intrapersonal coordination even when online feedback about a partner's actions is not available.

On the one hand, this could be taken to imply that principles of individual motor coordination structure dyadic per- formance. When people simulate a partner's actions to coordinate their actions with him or her they may be relying on internal models that govern the coordination of an individual's own limbs

On the other hand, there may be a more strategic component guiding joint action coordination in our task.

In the joint condition, both coactors are independent from each other, which would make mutual adaptation possible. Previous research has shown that when people try to synchronize identical actions (tapping) they both keep trying to adjust to each other on a trial-by-trial basis, which results in overadaptation (Konvalinka et al., 2010).

By assign- ing the coordination effort to one individual, depending on the relative difficulty of the actions to be coordinated, the problem of mutual adaptation is effectively solved.

Evidence for a strategic component in the joint jumping condition is provided by the observation that participants who adapted a lot when they jumped a lesser distance than their partner hardly adapted when they jumped a greater distance.


CONCLUSION: 
1. the results add to the action prediction literature (e.g., Wolpert et al., 2003) by suggesting that, in situations in which no online perceptual information about the coactor is available, general task information can provide a basis for forming motor simulations about a partner's subsequent actions. 

2. similarities between a joint and an individual bi- pedal jumping condition extend prior findings from studies on inter- and intrapersonal coordination (Schmidt {\&} Richardson, 2008) that propose common mechanisms underlying both. 

3. Finally, the finding of a clear task distribution between the person with the easier task and the person with the more difficult task supports recent suggestions about a strategic component to joint action coordination (Vesper et al., 2010).},

abstract = {Drawing on recent findings in the cognitive and neurosciences, this article discusses how people manage to predict each other's actions, which is fundamental for joint action. We explore how a common coding of perceived and performed actions may allow actors to predict the what, when, and where of others' actions. The “what” aspect refers to predictions about the kind of action the other will perform and to the intention that drives the action. The “when” aspect is critical for all joint actions requiring close temporal coordination. The “where” aspect is important for the online coordination of actions because actors need to effectively distribute a common space. We argue that although common coding of perceived and performed actions alone is not sufficient to enable one to engage in joint action, it provides a representational platform for integrating the actions of self and other.

abstract = {This paper outlines a framework for task representation and discusses applications to interference tasks in individual and joint settings. The framework is derived from the Theory of Event Coding (TEC). This theory regards task sets as transient assemblies of event codes in which stimulus and response codes interact and shape each other in particular ways. On the one hand, stimulus and response codes compete with each other within their respective subsets (horizontal interactions). On the other hand, stimulus and response code cooperate with each other (vertical interactions). Code interactions instantiating competition and cooperation apply to two time scales: on-line performance (i.e., doing the task) and off-line implementation (i.e., setting the task). Interference arises when stimulus and response codes overlap in features that are irrelevant for stimulus identification, but relevant for response selection. To resolve this dilemma, the feature profiles of event codes may become restructured in various ways. The framework is applied to three kinds of interference paradigms. Special emphasis is given to joint settings where tasks are shared between two participants. Major conclusions derived from these applications include: (1) Response competition is the chief driver of interference. Likewise, different modes of response competition give rise to different patterns of interference; (2) The type of features in which stimulus and response codes overlap is also a crucial factor. Different types of such features give likewise rise to different patterns of interference; and (3) Task sets for joint settings conflate intraindividual conflicts between responses (what), with interindividual conflicts between responding agents (whom). Features of response codes may, therefore, not only address responses, but also responding agents (both physically and socially).},

abstract = {To study the mechanisms of coordination that are fundamental to successful interactions we carried out a joint finger tapping experiment in which pairs of participants were asked to maintain a given beat while synchronizing to an auditory signal coming from the other person or the computer. When both were hearing each other, the pair became a coupled, mutually and continuously adaptive unit of two "hyper-followers", with their intertap intervals (ITIs) oscillating in opposite directions on a tap-to-tap basis. There was thus no evidence for the emergence of a leader-follower strategy. We also found that dyads were equally good at synchronizing with the irregular, but responsive other as with the predictable, unresponsive computer. However, they performed worse when the "other" was both irregular and unresponsive. We thus propose that interpersonal coordination is facilitated by the mutual abilities to (a) predict the other's subsequent action and (b) adapt accordingly on a millisecond timescale.},

abstract = {A significant challenge is to explain how people cooperate for public goods. The problem is more difficult for people when their public good and its benefits are unclear at the outset and its timing and costs are uncertain. However, history shows that even under adverse conditions, people can cooperate. As a prelude to cooperation, people can establish (or reinforce) social ties through communication. Consequently, individuals' cognitive states may synchronize, so that they can depend on like-minded people rather than on a situation beyond their control. Whether this succeeds largely depends on the network that is formed (or used), which should also help them to overcome misunderstandings and to synchronize relatively fast. From a well-known model of social influence it is inferred that network patterns with high algebraic connectivity, featuring multiple independent connections, are optimal for collective action.},

abstract = {The current research explores how awareness of shared attention influences attitude formation. We theorized that sharing the experience of an object with fellow group members would increase elaborative processing, which in turn would intensify the effects of participant mood on attitude formation. Four experiments found that observing the same object as similar others produced more positive ratings among those in a positive mood, but more negative ratings among those in a negative mood. Participant mood had a stronger influence on evaluations when an object had purportedly been viewed by similar others than when (a) that same object was being viewed by dissimilar others, (b) similar others were viewing a different object, (c) different others were viewing a different object, or (d) the object was viewed alone with no others present. Study 4 demonstrated that these effects were driven by heightened cognitive elaboration of the attended object in the shared attention condition. These findings support the theoretical conjecture that an object attended with one's ingroup is subject to broader encoding in relation to existing knowledge structures.},

abstract = {Attending where others gaze is one of the most fundamental mechanisms of social cognition. The present study is the first to examine the impact of the attribution of mind to others on gaze-guided attentional orienting and its ERP correlates. Using a paradigm in which attention was guided to a location by the gaze of a centrally presented face, we manipulated participants' beliefs about the gazer: gaze behavior was believed to result either from operations of a mind or from a machine. In Experiment 1, beliefs were manipulated by cue identity (human or robot), while in Experiment 2, cue identity (robot) remained identical across conditions and beliefs were manipulated solely via instruction, which was irrelevant to the task. ERP results and behavior showed that participants' attention was guided by gaze only when gaze was believed to be controlled by a human. Specifically, the P1 was more enhanced for validly, relative to invalidly, cued targets only when participants believed the gaze behavior was the result of a mind, rather than of a machine. This shows that sensory gain control can be influenced by higher-order (task-irrelevant) beliefs about the observed scene. We propose a new interdisciplinary model of social attention, which integrates ideas from cognitive and social neuroscience, as well as philosophy in order to provide a framework for understanding a crucial aspect of how humans' beliefs about the observed scene influence sensory processing.},

annote = {Self Determination Theory: SDT is a macro-theory of human motivation that is unique in acknowledging spontaneous and intrinsically motivated activities.

According to SDT (Deci {\&} Ryan, 1985, 2000), athletes are motivated by different reasons for sports participation. These different reasons or types of motivation varied in terms of the level of self-determination and they are considered located along a con- ceptual continuum (Deci {\&} Ryan, 2000).

SDT Spectrum:

lower end 
amotivation in which individuals are literary without motivation for the activity (e.g. lack of intention to sports participation).

extrinsic:
ranging from those which are con- trolled externally to those which are self-endorsed (Deci {\&} Ryan, 1985)

CONTROLLED MOTIVATION (non-self-determined)
External regulation 
describes those activities performed to satisfy external contingencies (e.g. participating in sport for getting money). 

introjected regulation, 
individuals control themselves with internal contingencies of reward and punishment (e.g. participating in sport for avoiding guilty or reaching ego-enhancement).

AUTONOMOUS MOTIVATION (self-determined regulations)
identified regulation 
recognise and accept personal importance or value of the activity (e.g. sports participation is valued as an important way for career develop- ment)

integrated regulation, 
they have integrated or assimilated values or needs to the self (e.g. sports participation becomes an integral part of one's life).

intrinsic motivation, 
which means doing the activity for its own sake (e.g. participating in sport to enjoy the activity itself; Deci {\&} Ryan, 1985, 2000).


Anumber of studies have found that amotivation and controlled motivation are associated with negative outcomes such as athlete burnout (e.g. Li,Wang, Pyun,{\&} Kee, 2013; Lonsdale, Hodge, {\&} Rose, 2009), negative moral behaviours (e.g. Vansteenkiste, Mouratidis, {\&} Lens, 2010), and dropout (Calvo, Cervell{\'{o}}, Jim{\'{e}}nez, Iglesias, {\&} Murcia, 2010).

athletes who are autonomously motivated are more likely to experience task involvement over ego involvement, approach orientations, vitality, positive affect, mental health, and life satisfaction (see Ng et al., 2012; Pelletir, Rocchi, Vallerand, Deci, {\&} Ryan, 2013).

Measuring sport motivation

Based on SDT, a measurement instrument entitled the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS) was devel- oped in Canada to assess five types of behavioural regulations except integrated regulation (Pelletier et al., 1995).

But has been criticised,

so:

Lonsdale, Hodge, and Rose (2008) devel- oped a new measure entitled the Behavioral Regulation in Sport Questionnaire (BRSQ) as an alternative measure to the SMS and SMS-6

also criticised...

Consequently, Pelletier et al. (2013) revised the SMS (renamed as the SMS-II) to address the
limitations of the SMS (e.g. some items did not fit the SDT constructs and lack of an integration subscale).

Pelletier et al. (2013) argued that the SMS-II is more theoretically aligned with its item content, overall briefer and more efficient to administer than the original SMS, and therefore encouraged researchers or practitioners to use the SMS-II as an alternative to the SMS.

Psychometric properties of the SMS-II have been examined in Swedish (Stenling, Ivarsson, Johnson, {\&} Lindwall, 2015) and Brazilian athletes (Nascimento Junior et al., 2014). 

Chinese Sports Motivation Scale-II:

Study1: Validation of CSMS-II

Results:
acceptable model fit for the hypothesised six-factor structure. 

discriminant validity: generally sufficient, identified regulation and integrated regu- lation were empirically indistinguishable for the current sample. 

As such, the six distinct factor structure proposed by SDT was not tenable with the current sample. 

Furthermore, the simplex-like pattern was not fully supported as a few exceptions were found. 





Study 2: Gender and age validity, and relationship to other scales
- Life Satisfaction
- Vitality 
- Burnout (namely reduced sense of accomplishment, sport devaluation, and emotional and physical exhaustion) asked over the last month


Results indicated that junior and senior age groups and male and female athletes interpreted the scale items in the same way

external validity:

amotivation was negatively related to
life satisfaction (r = −.15) and vitality (r =−.21)
positively associated with burnout (r = .48; see Table 2).

Controlled forms of motivation (i.e. external regulation and introjected regulation) were weakly associated with life satisfaction, subjective vitality, and burnout (r =−.08 to .20).

Autonomous forms of motivation (i.e. identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation) were positively associated with life satisfaction and subjective vitality with weak to moderate effect sizes (r = .20–.30).

Autonomous forms of motivation were negatively related to burnout with moderate effect sizes (r =−.28 to −.33).

Discussion:
The hypothesised six-factor structure was replicated in Study 2. The discriminant validity issue found in Study 1 was not observed in Study 2. This means that the two subscales (identified regu- lation and integrated regulation) are distinct for the independent sample in Study 2.

Similar to Study 1, a notable exception is that external regu- lation correlated about equally with autonomous forms of regulation. Given that the exception was also observed in Study 1, the deviation from the expected simplex pattern is unlikely to be caused by the sampling issue.

Study 3 
conducted to examine the test–retest reliability of the CSMS-II over a 1-week interval.
In summary, the CSMS-II responses were reliably stable for the interval period.

General Discussion
The factorial validity of the CSMS-II was generally supported across two independent samples.

Although identified regulation and integrated regulation were found empirically indistinguishable for the Chinese athletes who participated in Study 1, this issue was not replicated with another sample in Study 2. Therefore, the issue was considered sample specific. However, it might be also possible that athletes identified and valued their sports in a similar way (Sabiston {\&} Crocker, 2008).

Although the discriminant validity of the six hypothesised factors were established in Study 2,
the latent factor correlations among identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation found in Studies 1 and 2 ($\phi$ = .85–.94) were much higher than those found in Pelletier et al.'s(2013) study ($\phi$ = .68–.78). 

The higher latent factor correlations observed in the present study suggest that self-determined factors (i.e. intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, and identified regulation) might be less clearly differentiated by Chinese university athletes.

In other words, our participants may incline to respond to the self-determined factors in a similar way (Sabiston {\&} Crocker, 2008).

This does not mean that the constructs of the self-determined factors do not exist among the Chinese population. Ample evidence has supported the existence of identified regulation and intrinsic motivation in the Chinese context (see Liu, Chung, {\&} Si, 2013).

However, empirical support for the existence of integrated regulation for the Chinese population in sport was still lack. Interview studies could be useful for examining whether Chinese athletes' sport participation is regulated by integrated regulation.

However, the relation between external regulation and autonomous forms of motivation was deviated from the simplex-like pattern across both studies

One possibility could be due to the cultural difference. For example, for one item “because people around me reward me when I do” from the external regulation subscale, the term jiangli (i.e. reward) can be interpreted as either a material incentive (controlled form of regulation) or an encouragement message (auton- omous form of regulation) in the Chinese culture

the cultural difference between China and Western countries may limit the findings regarding simplex-like pattern. It is suggested that future studies should examine the cultural-invariance of the SMS-II responses, especially between Eastern and Western cultures.

External Validity
Relationship of CSMS-II to two adaptive outcome variables (i.e. life sat- isfaction and subjective vitality) and one maladaptive outcome variable (i.e. burnout)

Exceptions were that the relationships between autonomous forms of motivation and two outcome variables (i.e. life satisfaction and subjective vitality) did not support the hypothesised self-determination continuum. The issue was also observed in Pelletier et al.'s(2013) study. Despite this limitation, future research is warranted to investigate how the CSMS-II's subscales relate to other important positive and negative constructs in sport (e.g. sportsmanship, dropout, mental health, and life satisfaction).},

annote = {compare flow and emotional experience in interactive and coactive collective rituals

self-report measures of flow, positive emotions, and social identity in three different social collective gatherings:
1. the Sunday celebration of a Catholic mass (N = 57), 
2. a Zen Buddhist meditation practice (N = 50), and 
3. secular Sunday group activities (N = 37).

Results show:
- the presence of flow in all three contexts, being higher in the interactive social situations (the Catholic mass and other Sunday group activities) than in the coactive one (the Zen meditation practice
- Positive emotions are also higher in the interactive situations than in the coactive one. 
- self-transcendent emotions, there is more inspiration in the Zen meditation practice and more hope in the Catholic mass.
- Flow and positive emotions are positively correlated in all three contexts
- Specifically in the Zen meditation practice, flow, positive emotions, loss of self-consciousness, and social identity are positively correlated

INTRODUCTION:
Csikszentmihalyi (1990) stated that flow has influenced sociocultural evolution by reinforcing situations that prompt it, such as social rituals, contributing in that manner to the survival of societies.

In the past years, the interest to study flow in social contexts has increased. Sato (1998) was the first researcher to approach and study such phenomenon, establishing a connection with the sense of community or communitas—“a free and rewarding emotional closeness compared with the limitations of social roles, a sense of community and participation that builds social solidar- ity” (V. Turner, 1974)

Later, the connection among flow and communitas was empirically analyzed (McGinnis, Gentry, {\&} Gao, 2008), and the condi- tions and qualities of social flow were explored (Walker, 2010)

Recently, flow has been tracked down and studied in a variety of social situations, like in group music (Lamont, 2012; Livesey, Morrison, Clift, {\&} Camic, 2012), in group sports (Sch{\"{u}}ler {\&} Brunner, 2009), in group videogaming (Kaye {\&} Bryce, 2012), and other shared contexts.

This study:
The present study seeks to expand the knowledge on how flow operates in social situations or social flow (Walker, 2010), by empirically analyzing the linkages between flow experience and positive emotions that take place in dif- ferent spiritual and nonspiritual collective settings.


FLOW:
Flow is a positive emotional state that occurs when a person is fully immersed and absorbed in an activity

Flow is composed of nine dimensions divided into three interconnected stages: antecedents, experiences, and effects (Chen, Wigand, {\&} Nilan, 1999)

antecedents:
- a clear goal that 
- involves a challenge that is 
- in balance with the individual's abilities (challenge-skill ratio), and that 
- provides direct feedback

experiences:
- concentration on the task, 
- merging of action and awareness, and
- the consequent sense of control over the activity that is taking place

effects: 
- loss of self-consciousness,
- the distortion of time and 
- the autotelic experience

Study of flow:
as Csikszentmihalyi (1990) himself afirms, interest in the optimal experience expanded and was used by psychologists with an interest in happiness, life satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation; by sociologists interested in positive social experience (flow as the antithesis of alienation and anomie), and anthropologists exploring in ritual and religious experiences.

Regarding flow in social contexts, Csikszentmihalyi (1990) states that “loss of self-consciousness allows people to momentarily give up their normal identities and act in different roles,” thus the optimal experience in social contexts relates to V. Turner's (1974) communitas and Durkheim's (1912/2003) collective effervescence

McGinnis et al. (2008) analyzed the con- nections between flow and communitas, concluding, as already pointed out by Csikszentmihalyi (1997), that flow is experienced in multiple tasks such as ski- ing, climbing, dancing, surgery, musical performances, and friend's gatherings

Likewise, Walker (2010) studied the differences between social and solitary flow, and his findings, like the ones by Mesurado (2009), show that social flow provides more positive affect and enjoyment than solitary flow does, since 

the emotions produced by group flow are amplified by social sharing and emotional contagion

Walker distinguishes two differ- ent kinds of social flow: coactive flow (experienced in the presence of other people) and interactive flow (carried out in the interaction or cooperation with others), the latter being the one that induces more flow and positive affect

Flow in Spirituality
The term spirituality is related to inspiration and personal growth through the belief in a higher divine power that connects all things (Diener {\&} Biswas- Diener, 2008)

Spirituality has been described as a subjective experience of sacredness and transcendence, a search for existential meaning by contacting with the divine within the self, and it also includes the feeling of connectedness with a transcendent power, with oneself, with nature, with one's community, and the process of meaning making (Delle Fave et al., 2011b)

Spiritual rituals influence sensory stimuli by focusing the attention of the participants, who know the structure of the ritual, although they cannot predict what they will experience in each step of the process.

Practicing spirituality is also an oppor- tunity for socialization, since it promotes social support through the participa- tion to collective rituals and community activities (Delle Fave et al., 2011b)

Emotional Experience in Social Rituals
Social positive rituals are gatherings that generate positive, and socially ori- ented (Fredrickson, 2009) attitudes and emotions

Fredrickson suggests that positive emotions broaden our perspective, which expands our vision of our- selves and affects our social relationships. Thus, boundaries between the “I” and “you” fade in the minds, and as a result, new possibilities of connection emerge.

positive emotions alter the way people relate to others. Individuals perceive themselves closer and more connected, sensing that they are the same as those who are perceived as different at any other place and time.

In fact, participation in spiritual rituals is mainly associated to 
- provide and receive social support, 
- to generate the feeling of belonging to a community, (IDENTITY)
- to increase personal and collective self-esteem and closeness, and 
- achieve feelings such as “love thy neighbour” (Haidt, 2006)

spiritual rituals reinforce “self-transcendent emotions” like amazement, gratitude, inspiration, hope, and serenity (Emmons, 2005)

people focus their attention outward, while integrating ourselves into broader realities (like the group and/or the community)

In spiritual rituals, feelings of overpowering majesty and mystery are often experienced, thus eliciting awe, reverence, wonder, or amazement (Emmons, 2005; Fredrickson, 2009; Haidt, 2006).

dispositional measures of gratitude correlate with measures of spirituality (Emmons, 2005).

Loss of Self-Consciousness, Durkheim, and the Social Identity Theory
This feeling of unity may be either with an object (the mountain for the climber, the board for a chess player), or with the team to which the practitioner of a sport belongs.

This loss of self-consciousness effect, and the feeling of merging with the environment or with the group, is the mechanism that experientially articulates a change in the individual.

Its consequence is the decline of personal identity and the salience of social identity in a group—since the group's consciousness absorbs individuals, who end up identifying themselves more as members of the group. 

Social Identity Theory:
According to the group's social identity perspective (Tajfel {\&} Turner, 1986), what happens is that in a specific context (e.g., demonstrations, collective behaviors, or rituals) personal loss of identity is accompanied by a “salience” of social identity, which makes participants perceive themselves less as separate indi- viduals and more as members of the collective group (J. C. Turner, 1987)

Social identity theory coincides with Durkheim in its functionalist orientation (P{\'{a}}ez, Javaloy, Wlodarczyk, Espelt, {\&} Rim{\'{e}}, 2013; J. C. Turner, 1987), which states that rituals have a role in social cohesion and commitment to social values and beliefs, through emotional sharing, emotional communion, and a shared mode of perception with others (P{\'{a}}ez, Rim{\'{e}}, {\&} Basabe, 2005)

Rituals increase the emotional sharing and social ties, facilitating change and improvement of affect and cognition (P{\'{a}}ez {\&} Rim{\'{e}}, 2012)

Thus, group flow may be the facilitator of the emotional communion between the members, and the sense of identification with respect to the group. Furthermore, emo- tional communion and fusion of identity with the group are strongly associ- ated processes (P{\'{a}}ez {\&} Rim{\'{e}}, 2012)

Study AIMS:
showing whether flow is central to spiritual practices (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Csikszentmihalyi {\&} Csikszentmihalyi, 1998) that are associated with feelings of self-transcen- dence like amazement, gratitude, inspiration, hope, and serenity (Emmons, 2005).

we will examine how these self-transcendent emotions behave in coactive spiritual rituals (the Zen meditation practice) and interac- tive spiritual rituals (the Catholic mass), as opposed to other everyday collective gatherings.

Design:
behavior of participants at a Sunday Catholic mass—where praying, religious singing, Bible reading, and preach- ing take place—is observed, measured, and compared with a similar group who carried out important Sunday nonspiritual group activities (after-lunch conversations and/or playing cards with friends).

Hypotheses:
H1: flow and “high activation emotions” are stronger in interactive than in coactive group activities.
H2: Self-transcendent emotions are stronger in the spiritual activities than in the nonspiritual ones. 
H3: "low activation emotions” like calm or serenity are reinforced in the coactive ritual.
H4: flow experienced is associated with positive emotions in these activities.

H5: the flow experienced in this long-term group activity (zen meditation) is associated with positive emotions and high social identification, 
H6: the “loss of the self-consciousness” flow dimension is the psychological phenomenon that facilitates the emergence of the social identity in the group.


Measures:
Flow:
A short version (nine items) of the Flow State Scale (Jackson {\&} Marsh, 1996)
This short version contains one item for each of the nine dimensions of the optimal experience, 

Positive emotions:
The positive dimension (10 items) of Fredrickson's (2009) Emotions Scale
was used. The scale explores five positive emotions (amusement, pride, inter- est, joy, and love/closeness), and five other emotions (amazement, gratitude, inspiration, love/closeness, and serenity) which are particularly related to self-transcendence (Emmons, 2005).

Social Identity:
According to Hypotheses 5 and 6, the following scales were only applied to participants in the Zen meditation practice. Social Identity items (nine), based on the social identity theory of Tajfel and Turner (1986), which considers both aspects of social identity—antecedents and social identity effects—were used. 

Antecedents, such as the sense of belonging, identification, integration, and fusion with the group, consist of the following items:

“We felt proud to belong to this group,” 
“I had the feeling that the rest of the members became part of me,” 
“I felt very integrated into the group,” 
“I had the feeling that our group was different from other people,” and 
“I felt I had a lot in common with other group members.”

Social identity effects consist of two aspects, the affective level, with the following items: 
“I had the desire to interact with other members I didn't know,” 
“I felt closer to the rest of the people,” and,
“At that time people in my group seemed very interesting to me,” 

as well as the behavioral level, with the following items:
“I felt more willing to do something for a group member,” and 
“I felt more committed to the way of thinking and acting of my group.” 

to test the idea that when in the flow state individuals tend to forget about themselves 
Loss of self-consciousness (three items) was used. 
One item was taken from the short version of the Flow State Scale (Garc{\'{i}}a Calvo et al., 2008): “I felt totally absorbed by what I was doing and lost consciousness of myself,” and another one “I was not worried about the image I gave to others” were used by taking into account the aspect of loss of public self-awareness, disinhibition, and loss of self-image concerns

The social aspect of FLOW: 

the feeling of fusion with the environment or with the group (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990): “I felt transported out of me and part of the group.” These three items were cre- ated to operationalize the idea that the loss of self-consciousness when in flow during group activities is not only experiencing a mere lack of public awareness of the self but also the actual merging of the self with the collective.

RESULTS:
As expected, statistically signifi- cant differences were found in flow level between the three activities, F(2,128) = 9.80, p {\textless} .001, $\eta$p2 = .13 (Figure 1).
Pairwise comparisons were conducted in the three studies revealing that flow mean was higher in the Catholic mass (M = 4.00, SD = 0.61, p {\textless} .001) than in the Zen meditation practice (M = 3.54, SD = 0.53, p {\textless} .001), and flow also resulted higher in the nonspiritual activity (M = 3.93, SD = 0.69) than in Zen activity (M = 3.54, SD = 0.53, p = .04).

No statistically significant differences were found in flow experience during the nonspiritual activity versus the Catholic mass

a MANOVA was performed with nine dimensions of flow as dependent variables:
Separate ANOVAs (see Table 1) revealed significant group effects for
feedback
challenge
control
fusion
concentration

all five effects confirmed the above findings; participants in interactive activities scored higher for most flow dimensions

Hypothesis 2:
A multivariate analysis controlling age and gender of participants (MANCOVA) was performed to contrast whether “high activation emotions” increased in interactive compared with coactive activities.

Multivariate statistical significant differences in “high activation emotions” demonstrated to be as expected, 

Univariate significant differences were detected between the three groups with regard to emotions like amusement, interest ; and love/closeness,

paired-difference analysis showed that Sunday secular activities
(M = 3.19, SD = 0.81) provided more amusement than the Catholic mass and the Zen meditation practice , and also more interest than participating in the Zen ceremony

Individuals participating in the Catholic mass (M = 3.02, SD = 0.83) and Sunday secular activities affirmed to experience more love and closeness than those attending the Zen ceremony.

A MANCOVA contrasted the second and third hypotheses and confirmed
that the three activities were different in the self-transcendent emotions elicited.

significant differences on the level of hope among the
three activities, F(2, 126) = 3.33, p = .039, $\eta$p2 = .050. Post hoc contrast indi- cates that the Catholic mass generated more hope compared with the Zen meditation practice.

However, inspiration was higher in the Zen meditation practice than in the Catholic mass

although the feeling of serenity was higher in the Zen medita- tion practice, no statistically significant differences were found between the Zen meditation practice and the other activities.

Hypothesis 4 was confirmed after showing that flow is strongly associated with positive and self-trascendent emotions, r(141) = .47, p {\textless} .001.

As expected, a positive correlation was found between social identity and flow, “high activation emotions,” and “self-transcendent emotions,” 

social identity correlates with loss of self-con- sciousness during the activity, r(50) = .56, p {\textless} .001, and loss of self-consciousness correlates with flow r(50) = .563, p {\textless} .001).

Taking into account that flow correlates with loss of self-consciousness, and that both variables are predictors of social identity, a mediation model between flow and social identity was created by introducing the loss of self-consciousness as a media- tor variable (Figure 2).


Discussion:
As opposed to Delle Fave et al. (2011b, p. 263) findings, results reported above suggest that collective spiritual rituals represent a big opportunity for flow experience. 

flow is higher in the Catholic mass and in the nonspiritual activity than in the Zen meditation practice,
confirming that interactive collective gatherings induce more flow than other similar coactive ceremonies

According to these results, in secular activities that are relevant to the individual—such as after-lunch conversations and meeting with friends to play cards—the experience of flow tends to be more significant.

This is because of the fact that interactions with friends are freely chosen activities and are usually perceived as highly desirable, which tends to increase optimal experiences (Delle Fave et al., 2011a, p. 121)

With regard to “high activation emotions,” these generally occur more
intensely during the course of interactive rituals (the Catholic mass and the nonspiritual activities) than in the coactive Zen meditation practice, which confirms what Delle Fave et al. (2011a, p. 120) stated.

amuse- ment is higher in the nonspiritual activity than in both spiritual situations (the mass and the Zen meditation practice) confirming the rewarding effects of socialization in an individual's well-being

This result confirms that “positive relational emotions” are elicited in contexts where social interaction plays an important role in the develop- ment of the activity, and is more dynamic than in other more individual-ori- ented rituals.

In addition, the presence of these two emotions show an increased social support, which is inferred by the higher level of love and closeness, and that is common to collective gathering, either secular and/or religious.

Regarding “self-transcendent emotions,” differences were found to a lower extent. 

The level of hope was surprisingly high in both spiritual and nonspiritual activities. On one hand, the Catholic mass induces a higher level of hope than the Zen meditation practice, but lower than nonspiritual activities.

Zen meditation practice provides more inspiration than the Catholic mass, but does not induce more serenity and calm as expected (Delle Fave et al., 2011a).

This might be due to the fact that this ceremony requires a high level of concentration in breathing quietly during almost 2 hours (the duration of the ceremony)

which tends to be a significant challenge for the individual, that is the reason why flow indicates to be low in the Zen meditation practice.

the attention is focused on religious martyrs, models that have limited impact on the individual's reality (Emmons, 2005; Haidt, 2006) and consequently activate less inspiration

these results also demonstrate the relation between flow and the social identity activation. When flow is experienced in a social context, par- ticipants lose consciousness of their individuality, prompting them to behave according to the group norms, and becoming an expression of the group by acquiring its characteristics. Thus, in flow, the loss of self-consciousness (or personal identity) creates a heightened sense of belonging (or social identity), and individual characteristics vanish in favor of the social self and group characteristics.

individuals reach a state of synchrony and harmony. This creates a temporary alignment of their cognitions (aim, pur- pose, or representation of what is to be achieved in the activity), the action, and the external feedback received while performing the activity

The result- ing subjective experience involves powerful positive emotional states, as well as a loss of consciousness of the self, a feeling that the self, the action, and the people around become merged, and a consequent intense emotional experience of reward.

It is flow that builds up this state of self-transcendence, or of “transcendence” in the sense of this term itself. Indeed, psychological barriers that usually separate},

abstract = {Collective gatherings foster group cohesion through providing occasion for emotional sharing among participants. However, prior studies have failed to disentangle two processes that are involved in emotional sharing: 1) focusing shared attention on the same emotion-eliciting event and 2) actively sharing one's experiences and disclosing one's feelings to others. To date, it has remained untested if shared attention influences group cohesion independent of active emotional sharing. Our experiment investigated the effect of shared versus individual attention on cohesion in groups of strangers. We predicted that differences in group cohesion as called forth by shared vs. individual attention are most pronounced when experiencing highly arousing negative affect, in that the act of experiencing intensely negative affect with others buffers negative affect's otherwise detrimental effect on group cohesion. Two-hundred sixteen participants were assembled in groups of 3 to 4 people to either watch an emotion-eliciting film simultaneously on a common screen or to watch the same emotion-eliciting film clip on a laptop in front of each group member using earphones. The film clips were chosen to elicit either highly arousing negative affect or one of three other affective states representing the other poles in Russel's Circumplex model of affect. We examined self-reported affective and cognitive group cohesion and a behavioral measure of group cohesion. Results support our buffer-hypothesis, in that experiencing intense negative affect in unison leads to higher levels of group cohesion than experiencing this affect individually despite the group setting. The present study demonstrates that shared attention to intense negative emotional stimuli affects group cohesion independently of active emotional sharing.},

abstract = {Objectives: To examine (a) the effects of social identity on prosocial and antisocial behavior toward teammates and opponents, and (b) whether any effects of social identity on prosocial and antisocial behavior were mediated by cohesion. Design: Prospective, observational. Methods: Male and female youth-sport participants (N=329; Mage=15.88 years) completed questionnaires at the beginning, middle and end of the season assessing three dimensions of social identity (cognitive centrality, ingroup ties, ingroup affect), cohesion (task, social) and prosocial and antisocial behavior toward teammates and opponents. Results: With the exception of cognitive centrality (which was therefore not analyzed further), all measures of study variables proved reliable. Structural equation modeling indicated the following: Ingroup affect had a positive effect on prosocial teammate behavior, Task cohesion mediated a positive effect of ingroup ties on prosocial teammate behavior and a negative effect of ingroup ties and ingroup affect on antisocial behavior toward teammates and opponents. Social cohesion mediated a positive effect of ingroup ties on antisocial behavior toward teammates and opponents. Prosocial opponent behavior was not predicted by any dimension of social identity. Conclusion: The findings highlight that social identity may play a salient role in regulating prosocial and antisocial behavior in youth sport, and changes in cohesion may partially explain these effects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To explore the underlying mechanisms of how athlete leaders impact their team's confidence, an online survey was completed by 2,867 players and coaches from nine different team sports in Flanders (Belgium). We distinguished between two types of team confidence: collective efficacy, assessed by the CEQS subscales of effort, persistence, preparation, and unity; and team outcome confidence, measured by the ability subscale. The results demonstrated that the perceived quality of athlete leaders was positively related to participants' team outcome confidence. The present findings are the first in sport settings to highlight the potential value of collective efficacy and team identification as underlying processes. Because high-quality leaders strengthen team members' identification with the team, the current study also provides initial evidence for the applicability of the identity based leadership approach in sport settings.},

Drawing on the strength model of self-control we investigated whether athletes do not only differ inter-individually in their disposition of staying focused and avoiding distraction but also intra-individually in their situational availability of focused attention. Design/method: In the present experiment we hypothesized that basketball players (N=40) who have sufficient self-control resources will perform relatively better on a computer based decision making task under distraction conditions compared to a group who's self-control resources have been depleted in a prior task requiring self-control. Results: The results are in line with the strength model of self-control by demonstrating that an athlete's capability to focus attention relies on the situational availability of self-control strength.

Here we discuss empirical evidence from laboratory experiments and field studies of human interactions for each mechanism. We also consider cooperation in one-shot, anonymous interactions for which no mechanisms are apparent. We argue that this behavior reflects the overgeneralization of cooperative strategies learned in the context of direct and indirect reciprocity: we show that automatic, intuitive responses favor cooperative strategies that reciprocate. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This review considers the possibility that the neural circuits that mediate reward evolved for ethologically relevant cues, such as social attachment. Specifically, mesocorticolimbic dopamine appears important for maternal behavior in rats and pair bonding in monogamous voles. It is not yet clear that dopamine in this pathway mediates the hedonic properties of social bond formation or whether dopamine's role is more relevant to developing associative networks or assigning salience to social stimuli. The neuropeptides oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) appear to be critical for linking social signals to the mesocorticolimbic circuit.},

MacLean [1] described three forms of behavior associated with the transition

reptiles to mammals: 
1. nursing, 
2. audiovocal communication for maintaining maternal–off-spring contact, and 
3. play.

the emergence of a thalamocingulate limbic system in mammals was critical to these behavioral transitions.

MacLean speculated that sub- stance abuse and drug addiction were attempts to replace opiates or endogenous factors normally provided by social attachments

And he wondered if mother–infant, infant–mother, and male–female attach- ment might share a common neurobiology

ATTACHMENT: one of our most complex and powerful if least understood emotions.

Dopamine and addiction:

Addiction involves a poorly understood switch process in which an initially positive, rewarding response to a drug is replaced by preoccupation, compulsive intoxication, and withdrawal symptoms [3]

Based on results of psychostimulant administration, there
has been a casual assumption that dopamine release in this circuit mediates the hedonic properties of psychostimulants or natural rewards.

Studies of VTA firing patterns in monkeys suggest that activity predicts reward rather than signaling reward

Berridge and Robinson [7] have suggested that dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens signals the salience or motivational value of the stimulus, perhaps marking the transition from ‘‘liking'' to ‘‘wanting.'

others, noting that dopamine is released in this pathway in response to shock or withholding reward, have suggested that this pathway signals a behavioral switch or a change in effort or attention irrespective of the valence of the stimulus [8].},

abstract = {Studies on well-being derive from two main perspectives: hedonism and eudaimonism. The former emphasizes the human search for pleasure and satisfaction while the latter focuses on fulfillment of one's true nature that includes both self-actualization and commitment to socially shared goals. Operating under the eudaimonic approach, Psychological Selection and Optimal Experience Across Cultures uses recent advancements in positive psychology to explore the connections between personal well-being and social welfare. People grow and live in cultures that deeply influence their values, aspirations and behaviors. However, individuals in their turn play an active role in building their own goals, growth trajectories and social roles while at the same time influencing culture trends. This process, known as psychological selection, is related to the individual pursuit of well-being. People preferentially select and cultivate in their lives activities, interests and relationships associated with optimal experience—a state of deep engagement, concentration and enjoyment. Several cross-cultural studies confirm the positive and rewarding features of optimal experience, and based on these evidences this book highlights the interplay between individual and cultural growth trajectories, ultimately conveying the core message that educating people to enjoy engagement and involvement in activities that can be relevant and meaningful for social welfare is a premise to foster the harmonious development of human communities and the peaceful cohabitation of cultures. Interest in eudaimonia has grown rapidly, especially in the past five years. Given this book's emphasis on the role of individuals as active agents in shaping their cultural environment and in promoting both their own development and cultural complexity, it fills a unique place in the increasing demand for studies in the field. Aimed at researchers and students in Psychology, Education, Health and the Social Sciences, it is useful for anyone interested in the promotion of individual happiness and well-being.},

Grounded in the science of coordination dynamics, previous research has revealed that interpersonal synchrony has numerous affiliative and pro-social consequences, such as enhanced rapport, cooperation, and social-cognitive functioning. The current study sought to explore the impact of intentional synchrony versus asynchrony on an individual's self-esteem and their feelings of social connection with a partner. The results revealed that individuals felt better about themselves following a period of synchronous compared to asynchronous movement, while they also perceived a greater self-other overlap with their partner. These findings not only extend previous research on social connections following interpersonal synchrony, but also provide the first demonstration of an influence on self-evaluations. Overall, it appears that moving in time with others may result in us feeling better about ourselves compared to moving to our own rhythm.},

This study draws from and extends Lent and Lopez's (2002) tripartite model of relational efficacy, to present conceptual and empirical evidence for the role of self-efficacy as a metaperception (Estimations of the Other person's Self-Efficacy; EOSE) within coach-athlete and athlete-athlete contexts. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 members of international-level coach-athlete and athlete-athlete dyads. The data were subjected to content analysis. Results and Conclusions: Results revealed insight into the means through which dyad members form EOSE appraisals (i.e., antecedents), namely via perceptions regarding 'the other' (e.g., his/her verbal communication) and the dyad as a whole (i.e., mastery achievements as a dyad). EOSE was also reported to be aligned with important indices of individual and relationship functioning in the form of intra-personal (e.g., personal motivation) and interpersonal (e.g., relationship persistence intentions) outcomes. Overall, findings suggest that EOSE perceptions may represent an important relational efficacy construct within sporting contexts, and implications for theory advancement as well as applied considerations for supporting close relationships in athletic settings are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated athletes' responses to organisational stressors. Ten sport performers (five males and five females) were interviewed with regard to the organisational-related demands they had encountered and their responses to these stressors. The main emotional responses that were revealed were anger, anxiety, disappointment, distress, happiness, hope, relief, reproach and resentment. The main attitudinal responses were beliefs, motivation and satisfaction. The main behavioural responses were categorised as verbal and physical. The data indicate that performers generally respond to organisational stressors with a wide range of emotions, attitudes and behaviours. The findings are discussed in relation to the extant literature and in terms of their implications for applied practice and future research. Consultants should employ reactive strategies alongside proactive approaches to ensure that performers are psychologically prepared to manage and cope with any demands that are not eliminated. Future research should focus on performers' cognitive appraisals of the organisational stressors they encounter.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This study examined how social sharing and participating in secular political rituals regarding the March-Eleven (M-11) 2004 train bombings in Madrid, Spain, helps to cope with the wounds of trauma and enhances the reconstruction of a positive emotional climate. A questionnaire was completed by college students (63{\%} of sample) and their relatives (37{\%}) (N = 661) from five Spanish regions and eight universities at 1, 3, and 8 weeks after the bombing. Participating in demonstrations and experiencing a positive emotional climate, as reported a week after M-11, predicted the degree of social support and positive affect as well as the amount of posttraumatic growth reported at the 3-week period. Demonstrations (indirectly) and social sharing (directly) predict positive emotional climate 2 months after the attack. Participation in protest rituals or demonstrations, coupled with elections and changes in government office, helps overcome the effects of collective trauma and leads to an improvement of the emotional climate in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. Participating in ceremonies and rituals reinforces social cohesion and can be conceived of as a communal form of coping, which enhances a culture of peace.

For decades, it was hypothesized that exercise-induced endorphin release is solely responsible for a runner's high, but recent evidence has suggested that endocannabinoids also may play a role. Here, we demonstrate that wheel running increases endocannabinoids and reduces both anxiety and sensation of pain in mice. Ablation of cannabinoid receptor 1 receptors on GABAergic neurons inhibits running-induced anxiolysis, and pharmacological blockage of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors inhibits analgesia. We thus show for the first time to our knowledge that cannabinoid receptors are crucial for main aspects of a runner's high.},

abstract = {Existing scientific concepts of group or shared or collective emotion   fail to appreciate several elements of collectivity in such emotions.   Moreover, the idea of shared emotions is threatened by the individualism   of emotions that comes in three forms: ontological, epistemological, and   physical. The problem is whether or not we can provide a plausible   account of "straightforwardly shared" emotions without compromising our   intuitions about the individualism of emotions. I discuss two   philosophical accounts of shared emotions that explain the collectivity   of emotions in terms of their intentional structure: Margaret Gilbert's   plural subject account, and Hans Bernhard Schmid's phenomenological   account. I argue that Gilbert's view fails because it relegates   affective experience into a contingent role in emotions and because a   joint commitment to feel amounts to the creation of a feeling rule   rather than to an emotion. The problems with Schmid's view are twofold:   first, a phenomenological fusion of feelings is not necessary for shared   emotions and second, Schmid is not sensitive enough to different forms   of shared concerns. I then outline my own typology that distinguishes   between weakly, moderately, and strongly shared emotions on the basis of   the participants' shared concerns of different degree of collectivity,   on the one hand, and the synchronization of their emotional responses,   on the other hand. All kind of shared emotions in my typology are   consistent with the individualism of emotions, while the question about   "straightforward sharing" is argued to be of secondary importance.},

abstract = {Reciprocal cooperation occurswhen the overall beneﬁtsof receiving help exceed the costsof donating help (Q. Rev. Biol. 46 (197) 35). That is, individuals in good condition—for whom the pertinent costs are relatively small; donate help in order to secure reciprocity in their hour of need—when the beneﬁtsof receiving a donation are large. Consequently, reciprocity occursamong individuals who occasionally need help. In particular, such individuals will be unable to help others, no matter how deserving, when in need of help themselves—involuntary defection. Thispaper dealswith the effectsof involuntary defection in the context of a speciﬁc model of indirect reciprocity (i.e. reciprocal altruism that is directed toward all the cooperative members of the community) due to Nowak and Sigmund (J. Theor. Biol.194 (1998b) 561: Sections2–4). In that model, the authorsformulate the decision rules for conditional cooperation in the context of indirect reciprocity, and demonstrate that these decision rules can account for a longterm persistence of cooperation. Here we show that addition of involuntary defection to the decision rules formulated by Nowak and Sigmund results in indirect reciprocity that is evolutionary stable under appropriate conditions. Moreover, for a wide range of parameter values, evolutionary stability of cooperation requires a mixture of conditional- and unconditional-altruist behaviors. To recollect, unconditional altruist strategy can be viewed as conditional altruist strategy sansthe ability to decide when the help-soliciting individual should be refused help. That is, given involuntary defection, stability of cooperation requires an occasional forgiveness, if only by default, of a failure to donate help. Thus, we see that evolutionary stable indirect reciprocity does not require perfection in either the ability to assess the merits of the help-soliciting individuals, or the ability to donate help when it is merited. On the contrary, we are forced to conclude that reciprocity, at least in the current case, is stable only among imperfect individuals.},
annote = {Cooperation is a favorite topic among evolutionary biologists because it seems to be at variance with natural selection: Why should one individual help another who is a potential competitor in the struggle for survival?

Biologists are interested in cooperation, because it seems to be the antithesis to the competition that is fundamental to natural selection.

The Prisoner's Dilemma represents the most stringent situation, where natural selection opposes cooperation unless a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation is at work

In relaxed social dilem- mas some cooperation can evolve even without a mechanism, but a mechanism would tend to augment the level of cooperation or facilitate its emergence.

indirect reciprocity, 
spatial selection, 
multi-level selection and 
kin selection. 

Cooperation is a key aspect of social evolution, where interactions among individuals affect reproductive success. The standard mathematical approaches for studying social behavior are offered by game theory and and evolutionary game theory

Understanding the genetic evolution of behavior requires the interaction between evolutionary game theory and population genetics

the game is a cooperative dilemma if 
(i) two cooperators get a higher payoff than two defectors, R{\textgreater}P, and 
(ii) yet there is an incentive to defect.

This incentive can arise in three different ways: (iia) if T{\textgreater}R then it is better to defect when playing against a cooperator; 
(iib) if P{\textgreater}S then it is better to defect when playing against a defector; and 
(iic) if T{\textgreater}S then it is better to be the defector in an encounter between a cooperator and a defector.

Cooperative dilemmas which are not the Prisoner's Dilemma
could be called ‘relaxed cooperative dilemmas'. In these games it is possible to evolve some level of cooperation even if no mechanism is at work. One such example is the snow-drift game, given by T{\textgreater}R{\textgreater}S{\textgreater}P. Here we find a stable equilibrium between cooperators and defectors even in a well-mixed population},

annote = {As our findings indicate, however, engaging in synchronous behavior might activate a more general disposition to copy others that affects judgments and decisions in a later situation independently of any feelings of social connectedness that might accompany it!

being required to copy others' behavior, which restricts individuals' freedom of movement, can elicit psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966), motivating persons to reassert their individuality by not conforming

Jones and Nisbett (1971) postulated that people are likely to focus their attention on the aspects of a situation that are salient to them from the perspective they consider it. 

Thus:
actors' attention in a situation is directed outward, on the goal to which their behavior is relevant and the instrumentality of this behavior in attaining this goal.

In contrast, people who observe the actors are likely to focus on the actors' behavior independently of the goal to which it is directed.

when actors have an externally imposed objective of behaving in synchrony with others, they focus their attention on this objective and the effectiveness of their behavior (copying others' ac- tions) in attaining it.

As we elaborate presently, concepts activated by performing this goal-directed behavior may induce a behavioral mindset increases conformity to others' behavior in other, unre- lated situations. 

Furthermore, people's focus on the goal to which their behavior is directed is likely to decrease the feelings of being restricted that they might experience if they thought about their behavior per se.

In contrast, individuals who only observe synchronous behavior
may not be concerned with the goal to which the actors' behavior is directed. Therefore, they are more likely to focus their attention on the actors' behavior itself independently of this goal.  they may be particularly sensitive to the constraints on freedom that copying others' actions requires, and this can increase their concern about potential restrictions on their own freedom of action},

However, in the attempt to test and confirm a claim of universality, individual studies have been limited by small sample sizes, sample specificities, and an overwhelming focus on Anglo-European children. The current meta-analysis of children's false-belief performance provides the most comprehensive examination to date of theory-of-mind development in a population of non-Western children speaking non-Indo-European languages (i.e., Mandarin and Cantonese). The meta-analysis consisted of 196 Chinese conditions (127 from mainland China and 69 from Hong Kong), representing responses from more than 3,000 children, compared with 155 similar North American conditions (83 conditions from the United States and 72 conditions from Canada). The findings show parallel developmental trajectories of false-belief understanding for children in China and North America coupled with significant differences in the timing of development across communities—children's false-belief performance varied across different locales by as much as 2 or more years. These data support the importance of both universal trajectories and specific experiential factors in the development of theory of mind.},

The evolutionary history of these findings resides, at a mechanistic level, in the reciprocal bonding between mother and infant that is common to all mammals. However, in Old World primates, where mother and infant alone would not survive, living in large social groups brings extended family relationships and provides for alloparenting. This has required the emancipation of parenting behaviour from the constraints of hormonal state and the evolution of large brains for decision making that was previously restricted and determined by hormonal state. How this has been achieved, what conserved mechanisms underpin social bonding, and what genetic and mechanistic changes have occurred in the evolution of social bonds are the issues addressed here. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The persistence of such norms is consistent with evolutionary game theory, but existing models do not provide a plausible explanation for why they are common. We show that when a model of imitation used to derive replicator dynamics in isolated populations is generalized to allow for population structure, group beneficial norms can spread rapidly under plausible conditions. We also show that this mechanism allows recombination of different group beneficial norms arising in different populations.},

abstract = {The 'social brain hypothesis' for the evolution of large brains in primates has led to evidence for the coevolution of neocortical size and social group sizes, suggesting that there is a cognitive constraint on group size that depends, in some way, on the volume of neural material available for processing and synthesizing information on social relationships. More recently, work on both human and non-human primates has suggested that social groups are often hierarchically structured. We combine data on human grouping patterns in a comprehensive and systematic study. Using fractal analysis, we identify, with high statistical confidence, a discrete hierarchy of group sizes with a preferred scaling ratio close to three: rather than a single or a continuous spectrum of group sizes, humans spontaneously form groups of preferred sizes organized in a geometrical series approximating 3-5, 9-15, 30-45, etc. Such discrete scale invariance could be related to that identified in signatures of herding behaviour in financial markets and might reflect a hierarchical processing of social nearness by human brains.},

abstract = {Both humans and group-living animals associate and behave affiliatively more with some individuals than others. Human friendship has long been acknowledged, and recently scientists studying animal behaviour have started using the term friendship for close social associates in animals. Yet, while biologists describe friends as social tools to enhance fitness, social scientists describe human friendship as unconditional. We investigate whether these different descriptions reflect true differences in human friendship and animal close social associations or are a by-product of different research approaches: namely social scientists focussing on proximate and biologists on ultimate explanations. We first stress the importance of similar measures to determine close social associations, thereafter examine their ultimate benefits and proximate motivations, and discuss the latest findings on the central-neural regulation of social bonds. We conclude that both human friendship and animal close social associations are ultimately beneficial. On the proximate level, motivations for friendship in humans and for close social associations in animals are not necessarily based on benefits and are often unconditional. Moreover, humans share with many animals a similar physiological basis of sociality. Therefore, biologists and social scientist describe the same phenomenon, and the use of the term friendship for animals seems justified.},

abstract = {Psychological studies of relationships tend to focus on specific types of close personal relationships (romantic, parent-offspring, friendship) and examine characteristics of both the individuals and the dyad. This paper looks more broadly at the wider range of relationships that constitute an individual's personal social world. Recent work on the composition of personal social networks suggests that they consist of a series of layers that differ in the quality and quantity of relationships involved. Each layer increases relationship numbers by an approximate multiple of 3 (5-15-50-150) but decreasing levels of intimacy (strong, medium, and weak ties) and frequency of interaction. To account for these regularities, we draw on both social and evolutionary psychology to argue that relationships at different layers serve different functions and have different cost-benefit profiles. At each layer, the benefits are asymptotic but the costs of maintaining a relationship at that level (most obviously, the time that has to be invested in servicing it) are roughly linear with the number of relationships. The trade-off between costs and benefits at a given level, and across the different types of demands and resources typical of different levels, gives rise to a distribution of social effort that generates and maintains a hierarchy of layered sets of relationships within social networks. We suggest that, psychologically, these trade-offs are related to the level of trust in a relationship, and that this is itself a function of the time invested in the relationship.},

abstract = {Because little is known about the human trait of affiliation, we provide a novel neurobehavioral model of affiliative bonding. Discussion is organized around processes of reward and memory formation that occur during approach and consummatory phases of affiliation. Appetitive and consummatory reward processes are mediated independently by the activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA)-nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) pathway and the central corticolimbic projections of the u-opiate system of the medial basal arcuate nucleus, respectively, although these two projection systems functionally interact across time. We next explicate the manner in which DA and glutamate interact in both the VTA and NAS to form incentive-encoded contextual memory ensembles that are predictive of reward derived from affiliative objects. Affiliative stimuli, in particular, are incorporated within contextual ensembles predictive of affiliative reward via: (a) the binding of affiliative stimuli in the rostral circuit of the medial extended amygdala and subsequent transmission to the NAS shell; (b) affiliative stimulus-induced opiate potentiation of DA processes in the VTA and NAS; and (c) permissive or facilitatory effects of gonadal steroids, oxytocin (in interaction with DA), and vasopressin on (i) sensory, perceptual, and attentional processing of affiliative stimuli and (ii) formation of social memories. Among these various processes, we propose that the capacity to experience affiliative reward via opiate functioning has a disproportionate weight in determining individual differences in affiliation. We delineate sources of these individual differences, and provide the first human data that support an association between opiate functioning and variation in trait affiliation.},

@article{Dunbar2010,
abstract = {Approaches to sociality have, in the past, focused either on group typologies or on the functional aspects of relationships (mate choice, parental investment decisions). In contrast, the nature of the social relationships that scale from the individual-level behavioural decisions to the emergent properties represented by group typology has received almost no attention at all.We argue that that there is now a need to refocus attention on the bonding processes that give rise to social groups. However, we lack any kind of language with which to describe or classify these operationally, in part perhaps because social bonding is emotional (and, hence, ‘felt'). One task for the future is, therefore, to identify suitable indices that can be used to compare the degree of bondedness between individual animals both between species and, within species, between individual dyads in such a way as to be able to test functional questions.},
annote = {On a broader level, the amount of time devoted to social interaction may provide an index of howdemanding different relationships are for individuals (see Shultz{\&}Dunbar, 2007)

issues:
1. individuals in large groups may spend more total time socialising, yet have only relatively loose associations with many individuals. Conversely, pairbonded species such as klipspringermight spend less time in social activity, but devote it all to a single partner.Which of these species is themore bonded?

2. Asecond issue iswhether data for different taxa have been recorded in comparable form. n primates, most behavioural researchers record social activity as a separate class of behaviour (in addition to feeding, resting, moving, etc.) because these species devote so much time to social grooming.

However, in less intensely social species, researchers often include social behaviour in a nondescript category of miscellaneous behaviours or even simply subsume it under a more general category of resting time

Shultz {\&} Dunbar (2007) found that pairbonded primates and ungulates devote significantly more time per group member to social activities than primate species living in bonded groups, who in turn spend more time than ungulate species that live in unbonded groups.

These proxies are as much outcomes of being bonded as they are indices of bonding and we will often want to know why individuals who groom or forage together do so.


An alternative approach might be to use behavioural responses when animals meet after a natural period of separation or following a natural challenge (e.g., a territorial dispute or an attempted group takeover)

In elephants, for example, members of the same bond group greet each other after an ab- sence with levels of excitement that are never seen when members of dif- ferent clans (the next social layer up) meet (Moss {\&} Poole, 1983; McComb et al., 2000).

Spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) use ritualised greeting behaviours when sub-groups reconvene (Aureli {\&} Schaffner, 2007). 

Blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) females groom each other intensely after engaging in collective defence of their group territory (Cords, 2002)

More importantly, we can only use behaviours displayed after a period of separation in those species that have natural fission–fusion social systems

Indeed, the question of how reconciliation is affected by the quality of a relationship (which might be interpreted in terms of bond strength) is one that has exercised those who work on this topic (van Schaik {\&} Aureli, 2000). However, some key exceptions aside (e.g., dogs, hyaenas, goats and dolphins: Schino, 1998; Samuels{\&}Flaherty, 2000;Wahaj et al., 2001; Cools et al., 2008), there is little evidence to suggest that reconciliation is widely common outside the primates (Aureli {\&} de Waal, 2000)

One aspect of bonded relationships thatwould seem to be germane to their survival through time is the need to coordinate and synchronise behaviour.

Pairs of individuals, whether mates or allies, would not be able to achieve their fitness objectives (whether these be shared reproduction or functional alliances) if the absence of behavioural coordination resulted in their drifting apart.

Physical togetherness not only constitutes one of the core dimensions that social psychologists have identified as defining friendships (Sternberg, 1977; Berscheid et al., 1989), but it also highlights a second, namely the need to share activities and interests. (SHARE COMPETENCIES!)

In species that operate a fission–fusion form of sociality (such as many ungulates), lack of behavioural synchrony inexorably leads to group fission and the spatial sep- aration of individuals (Conradt, 1998a; Calhim et al., 2006; Dunbar {\&} Shi, 2008)

BEHAVIOURAL SYNCHRONY:
In species that operate a fission–fusion form of sociality (such as many ungulates), lack of behavioural synchrony inexorably leads to group fission and the spatial sep- aration of individuals (Conradt, 1998a; Calhim et al., 2006; Dunbar {\&} Shi, 2008)

Studies of ungulates, for example, have identified activity synchrony and preferences for the certain kinds of habitat as major factors giving rise to sexual segregation

Similarly, in monogamous species of antelope (e.g., klipspringer, dikdik) and primates (e.g., gibbons), pairs that do not co- ordinate their behaviour are likely to become separated as their individual activity cycles become desynchronised; physical separation may then result in animals being exposed to increased risks of predation, infanticide, extra- pair matings, harassment or reduced foraging efficiency (Dunbar {\&} Dunbar, 1980; van Schaik {\&} Dunbar, 1990; Komers {\&} Brotherton, 1997; Brotherton {\&} Komers, 2003)

At least in humans, synchronised action yields a signif- icant upsurge in endorphin production (Cohen et al., 2010) and has a dra- matically positive effect on generosity in public good games (Wiltermuth {\&} Heath, 2009)

Thus, anti-synchrony (as op- posed to the asynchronised behaviour that gives rise to social segregation in ungulates) may be as much a hallmark of a deeply bonded relationship as close synchrony.

social monitoring:
Paying close attention to a partner is likely to be an essential requirement for behavioural synchrony, in that behavioural coordination requires that at least one member of the dyad adjust its behaviour to fit that of its partner — something it can only do this only if it attends closely to the partner's behaviour.

In humans, fixated gaze is widely recognised as a feature of romantic engagement (Fisher, 2006), and is certainly an important cue indicating relational interest during conversations (Vertegaal et al., 2001; Vertegaal {\&} Ding, 2002).

Chance {\&} Jolly (1970) suggested many years ago that primates could be differentiated into those with ‘centripetal' and thosewith ‘centrifugal' patterns of visual attention. The former category would identify species with more intense social relationships in which individuals constantly monitor other members of the group.

vigilance:
has focussed on monitoring either for predators (Hart {\&} Lendrem, 1984; Elgar, 1989; Hunter {\&} Skinner, 1998; Treves, 2000) or for social competi- tors (Keverne et al., 1978; Caine, 1984; Aureli {\&} Schaffner, 2002), rather than monitoring social partners; most such studies, thus, likely reflect anxiety rather than bondedness (see also Castles et al., 1999)

On this simple index of social intensity (essentially an index of attentiveness to othergroup members), monogamous klipspringer are significantly more attentive to their mates than is a polygamous primate, who in turn are significantly more attentive to other members of their social group than a loosely bonded ungulate

functionally, the issue here is the extent to which attention to others facilitates coordination of activity. But it may, at the same time, also function as a declaration of interest (and probably does so in humans, at least: Dunbar et al., 2002

certainly true that social monitoring occurs in order to monitor the whereabouts of resource competitors or to avoid harassment from higher ranking individuals, 

but worth pointing out that there is only limited empirical evidence to support the claim that social monitoring is actually re- lated to the avoidance of within-group aggression, and that only from caged groups (Keverne et al., 1978; McNelis {\&} Boatright-Horowitz, 1998) where aggression rates are commonly an order of magnitude higher than in wild populations (Gartlan, 1968).

That high-rank individuals attract more social monitoring may simply reflect their social attractiveness (cf., Seyfarth's (1977) seminal explanation for why social grooming often accumulates ‘up the hierarchy').

Altmann (1980), for example, found that, among baboon mothers, glance rate (which included both predator vigilance and social monitoring) was a good predictor of ma- ternal style, but a poor predictor of dominance rank

Similarly, a detailed critical tests analysis of vigilance patterns in humans showed that visual monitoring is driven predominantly by mate searching considerations rather than predation risk (Dunbar et al., 2002), and Keverne et al. (1978) likewise noted that, when a female was in oestrus, monitoring rates of the opposite sex increased significantly among talapoins.


Thus, while we surely need to take care not to confound vigilance driven by different motivations, social monitoring may nonetheless be as valuable a tool for the non-invasive assay of social bondedness as anything else on offer. 

At a more cognitive level, current interest in social network analysis might offer an index of social complexity that at least taps directly into the cognitive demands of bonding

Although network analysis is a well de- veloped area within human sociology (Pattison, 1993; Watts, 1999; Palla et al., 2007), it is only very recently that attempts have been made to apply these analytical techniques to non-human species (see, for example, Lusseau et al., 2004; Lehmann {\&} Dunbar, 2009)

two possible aspects of network structure might recommend themselves as indices of social engagement:

1. OldWorld monkeys, Lehmann
{\&} Dunbar (2009) have been able to show that several indices of network density and connectedness correlate independently with relative neocortex size and group size. In effect, as group size increases, animals may spend more time grooming, but focus this increasingly on a more select subset of individuals.

In effect, their relationships become more intense and focussed. While network indices may provide us with a way ahead, this result should caution us against na{\"{i}}ve interpretations of these indices: 
highly connected animals (in the network sense) may not be those with the most intense social bonds.

2. it has been shown, for both humans (Zhou et al., 2005; Hamilton et al., 2007) and some animal taxa (Moss {\&} Poole, 1983; Kudo {\&} Dunbar, 2001;Wittemyer et al., 2005; Hill et al., 2008) that social networks in complexly organised societies have a distinctive hierarchical structure: an individual's network of relationships can be described as a hierarchically in- clusive series of circles of acquaintanceship which have a consistent scaling ratio very close to 3. 

Species may differ in the size of the base layer (the number of individuals in the innermost circle of relationships, with the size of successive layers in the network a constant multiple of this number) or they may all have the same base layer (but differ in the number of layers they can support above that).

We suggest that the level of social complexity (and hence the bondedness) characteristic of a species might be indexed as a combination of the size of the base unit and the number of layers of acquaintanceship that emerge from it (Kudo{\&}Dunbar, 2001).

CONCLUSION:
ethologists have generally
ducked the question of what social bonds actually are, and as a result we have no descriptive indices that we can use to quantify differences either be- tween species or, within species, between individuals

We argue that, at least in respect of our understanding of the more intensely social species of animals, progress has been impeded by an over-dependence on the behaviourist stance—the claim made by the early twentieth century behaviourists that we can only ever study behaviour and not the mind behind the behaviour (a perspective that was largely abandoned in cognitive psychology during the 1980s)

We have suggested three novel ones (behavioural synchrony, directed vocal exchanges and socialmonitoring),},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A niche is the structural, temporal, and social context in which a species exists. Over the last two million years, the human lineage underwent clear morphological changes alongside less easily measurable, but significant, behavioral and cognitive shifts as it forged, and was shaped by, new niches. During this time period, core human patterns emerged, including the following: hypercooperation; lengthy childhood and complex parenting; intricate and diverse foraging and hunting patterns; novel and dynamic material and symbolic cultures; and complex communication and information sharing, eventually resulting in language. Approaches to human evolution grounded in paleoanthropology and archaeology offer fundamental insights into our past, and traditional evolutionary theory offers a strong grounding for explaining them. However, given the centrality of distinctive physiological, social, semiotic, and cognitive processes in human evolutionary histories, a broader anthropological approach can facilitate additional understanding of the human story. An integrative anthropology, reaching across subfields and foci, combined with contemporary evolutionary theory is an approach that can enhance our abilities to model and understand human evolution.

Judith Butler critiques the use of violence that has emerged as a response to loss, and argues that the dislocation of first-world privilege offers instead a chance to imagine a world in which that violence might be minimized and in which interdependency becomes acknowledged as the basis for a global political community. Butler considers the means by which some lives become grief-worthy, while others are perceived as undeserving of grief or even incomprehensible as lives. She discusses the political implications of sovereignty in light of the prisoners in Guant{\'{a}}namo Bay. She argues against the anti-intellectual current of contemporary US patriotism and the power of censorship during times of war. Finally, she takes on the question of when and why anti-semitism is leveled as a charge against those who voice criticisms of the Israeli state. She counters that we have a responsibility to speak out against both Israeli injustices and anti-semitism, and argues against the rhetorical use of the charge of anti-semitism to quell public debate.},

@article{Atran2016,
annote = {Soccer, paintball, camping, hiking, rafting, body building,
martial arts training, and other forms of physically stimulat- ing and intimate group action create a small cultural niche: a bunch of buddies who become a “band of brothers” in a glorious cause (Atran 2010).

counterterrorism notions of “cells” and “recruit- ment”—and to some degree even “leadership”—often reflect more the psychology and organization of people analyzing terrorist groups than terrorist groups themselves. 

enlistment into the group is of- ten elective, especially for foreign volunteers, and tactical decision making is generally decentralized.

For the first time in history, a massive, media-driven political awakening has been occurring, spurred by the advent of the Internet, social media, and cable television: on the one hand, this may motivate universal respect for human rights; on the other hand, it may enable, say, Muslims from Sula- wesi to sacrifice themselves for Palestine, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iraq, or Syria. 

When perceived global injustice reso- nates with frustrated personal aspirations, moral outrage gives universal meaning and provides the push to radicalization and violent action.

But the popular notion of a “clash of civiliza- tions” between Islamand the West (Huntington 1996) is woefully misleading:

Violent extremism represents not the resur- gence of traditional cultures but their collapse as young people unmoored from millennial traditions flail about in search of social identity that gives personal significance and glory. 

This is the dark side of globalization

Especially for young men, mortal combat with a “band of
brothers” in the service of a great cause is both the ultimate adventure and a road to esteem in the hearts of their peers

For many disaffected souls today, jihad is a heroic cause—a promise that anyone fromanywhere can make amark against history's most powerful country and its perceived allies.

"But because would-be jihadists best thrive and act in small groups and among family, friends, and fellow travelers—not in large movements or armies—their threat can only match their am- bitions if fueled beyond actual strength. Publicity hyped by po- litical and media frenzy is the oxygen that fires modern ter- rorism(Atran 2013), filling a transcultural niche whose ecology ranges over amedia landscape (where competition for resources is a struggle for control of information) and a geographical archipelago that spans the globe"

When we asked the Islamic State prisoners, “What is Islam?” they answered, “My life.” Yet it was clear that they knew little about the Quran, or Islamic history, other than what they had heard from al-Qaeda and Islamic State propaganda.

For them, the cause of religion is fused with the vi- sion of a caliphate—a joining of political and religious rule—that kills or subjugates any nonbeliever.

Using our standard experimen- tal procedures (Sheikh, G{\'{o}}mez, and Atran 2016), we found that 36 respondents are fused with “Kurds,” 35 with “family,” 23 with “close, family-like group” of comrades, and 14 with “Islam.” But in rankings of relative importance of identity fusion, 21 respondents reported that fusion with “Kurds” trump all other forms of identity fusion, three privileged Is- lam, only one respondent considered fusion with “family” as foremost, and no respondent held that “close, family-like group” is primary.

defense of “Kurdeity” (as the Kurds themselves term their commitment to fellow Kurds as well as to defense of “our Kurdistan homeland”) is the most impor- tant obligation in life, deserving of costly sacrifice unto death, if necessary (i.e., 22 respondents, several of whom had been previouslywounded,would bewilling to die and sacrifice their families in defense of Kurdeity versus three who would be willing to sacrifice Kurdeity and family for Islamand one who was willing to sacrifice Kurdeity and Islam for family

larger groups that are sacralized (in terms of territory, cultural history, lan- guage, etc.) can be the primary locus of identity fusion and of the interaction between identity fusion and sacred values in producing costly sacrifices, including fighting and dying.

If this is so, then the primary relationship between identity fu- sion and willingness to fight need not be always at the level of a close, family-like group:

the strongest and most powerful forms of sacrifice for group and cause need not always require a process of “upscaling” from a localized family-like cohort of comrades to an extended ideological community but may inhere in a larger, sacralized community to begin with, especially in “tight societies” that have strong social norms and strict channels of socialization (Gelfand et al. 2011).

Such larger and tight societies include the geo- graphically bounded but stateless cultural sphere ofKurdistan as well as the global jihadi archipelago where information from across the world and cyberspace narrows mightily to fit the dreaming ecology of the Caliphate—a transcultural niche, which the actors of Kurdistan are fighting unto death to de- feat and the devoted actors of the Islamic State are fighting unto death to make real.6


“Mr. Hitler,” wrote George Orwell (1968 [1940]) in his
review of Mein Kampf, “has grasped the falsity of the hedo- nistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought . . . certainly all ‘progressive' thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain.” In such a view of life there is no room for greatness and glory, which as Darwin notedmotivates heroes and mar- tyrs to motivate others to survive and even triumph against greatmaterial odds. “Hitler knows . . . that human beings don't only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice” (Orwell 1968 [1940]).

From an evo- lutionary and historical vantage, no developments are really deviant or extreme unless they quickly die, for those devel- opments that continue to survive are the very stuff of his- torical change and evolution.

What dreams may come from current government policies that offer little be- yond promises of comfort and security (Atran 2015)? People who are willing to sacrifice everything, including their lives— the totality of their self-interests—will not be lured away just by material incentives or disincentives.8

The science suggests that sacred values are best opposed with other sacred values that inspire devotion, or by sundering the fused social net- works that embed those values.},

abstract = {How did human societies evolve from small groups, integrated by face-to-face cooperation, to huge anonymous societies of today, typically organized as states? Why is there so much variation in the ability of different human populations to construct viable states? Existing theories are usually formulated as verbal models and, as a result, do not yield sharply defined, quantitative predictions that could be unambiguously tested with data. Here we develop a cultural evolutionary model that predicts where and when the largest-scale complex societies arose in human history. The central premise of the model, which we test, is that costly institutions that enabled large human groups to function without splitting up evolved as a result of intense competition between societies-primarily warfare. Warfare intensity, in turn, depended on the spread of historically attested military technologies (e.g., chariots and cavalry) and on geographic factors (e.g., rugged landscape). The model was simulated within a realistic landscape of the Afroeurasian landmass and its predictions were tested against a large dataset documenting the spatiotemporal distribution of historical large-scale societies in Afroeurasia between 1,500 BCE and 1,500 CE. The model-predicted pattern of spread of large-scale societies was very similar to the observed one. Overall, the model explained 65{\%} of variance in the data. An alternative model, omitting the effect of diffusing military technologies, explained only 16{\%} of variance. Our results support theories that emphasize the role of institutions in state-building and suggest a possible explanation why a long history of statehood is positively correlated with political stability, institutional quality, and income per capita.},

COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS:
As an example of an ultrasocial norm, consider generalized trust:

Propensity to trust and help individuals outside of one's ethnic group has a clear benefit for multiethnic societies

but ethnic groups among whom this ultrasocial norm is wide- spread are vulnerable to free-riding by ethnic groups that restrict cooperation to coethnics (e.g., ethnic mafias).

government by professional bureaucracies (15).
Other examples include systems of formal education, and
World religions first appeared during the Axial Age (16) and provided a basis for integrating multiethnic populations within first mega-empires, such as Achae- menid Persia (Zoroastrianism), Han China (Confucianism), and Maurya Empire (Buddhism).

Because the benefits of ultrasocial institutions are only felt at larger scales of social organization, and costs are born by lower-level units, fragmentation into lower-level units often leads to a loss of such institutions.

Costly ultrasocial institutions can evolve and be maintained as a result of competition between societies: societies with traits that enable greater control and coordination of larger numbers will out-compete those that lack such traits (2, 18–20). 

selection for ultrasocial institutions and social complexity is greater where warfare be- tween societies is more intense.

WARFARE:
Historically one of the most important factors determining the intensity of Afroeurasian warfare was proximity to grasslands inhabited by horse-riding nomads (21–24)

The MODEL:
The conceptual core of the model invokes the following causal chain: 

spread of military technologies (competency)→intensification of warfare→evolution of ultrasocial traits→rise of large-scale societies.

As in the real data, the first imperiogenesis hotspots appear in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and North China because these areas are situated near the steppe frontier, and that is where MilTech diffuse first tipping the selection in favor of ultrasocial traits. A sufficient frequency of ultrasocial traits, then, enables the rise of large and relatively stable states.

Fig. 2 shows that the density of ultrasocial traits is closely correlated with imperial density. 

Macrostate formation then occurs when MilTech traits diffuse to the central Mediterranean/western Europe, north India, and South China, and yet later to northern and eastern Europe, Ja- pan, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.


warfare equally intense everywhere (no effect of MilTech) or seeding MilTech randomly (instead of on the steppe interface) results in an almost complete loss of predictability (Table 1). This result shows that the match between the model and the historical data is not simply an artifact of the particular shape of the grid in which we run our model. It appears that the diffusion of MilTech and its effect on warfare intensity did indeed create an important selective force favoring the emergence of larger- scale societies.

show that the distance from the steppe is the strongest predictor of total imperial density in agricultural cells (Fig. 3B), followed by a measure of the long-term presence of agriculture in these cells, and elevation (SI Appendix).

Interestingly, the estimated historical distribution of horse-based warfare involving chariots and cavalry is also a good predictor of imperial density, which is consistent with our assumption that more intense forms of warfare act as an evolutionary driver of social complexity

Military technology spreads via cultural transmission, yet the most important aspect of this factor was that the location of its initial development was on the ecological boundary of the

Eurasian steppe (which itself was due to a historical contingency— availability of wild horses for domestication). In turn, this may explain why factors relating to countries' economic and political development, including institutional quality and even income per capita, show positive associations with a long history of state- hood (32)},

Experimental evidence indicates that human altruism is a powerful force and is unique in the animal world. However, there is much individual heterogeneity and the interaction between altruists and selfish individuals is vital to human cooperation. Depending on the environment, a minority of altruists can force a majority of selfish individuals to cooperate or, conversely, a few egoists can induce a large number of altruists to defect. Current gene-based evolutionary theories cannot explain important patterns of human altruism, pointing towards the importance of both theories of cultural evolution as well as gene-culture co-evolution.},

Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used H2 15O positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment, activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions. Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors.},

abstract = {{\{}blacksquare{\}} On 13 February 2008, the Australian government apologized to the stolen generations': those children of Aboriginal descent who were removed from their parents (usually their Aboriginal mothers) to be raised in white foster-homes and institutions administered by government and Christian churches -- a practice that lasted from before the First World War to the early 1970s. This apology was significant, in the words of Rudd, for the healing' of the Australian nation. Apologizing for past injustices has become a significant speech act in current times. Why does saying sorry seem to be ubiquitous at the moment? What are the instances of not saying sorry? What are the ethical implications of this era of remembrance and apology? This set of commentaries seeks to explore some of the ethical, philosophical, social and political dimensions of this Age of Apology. The authors discuss whether apology is a responsibility which cannot -- and should not -- be avoided; the ethical pitfalls of seeking an apology, or not uttering it; the global and local understandings of apology and forgiveness; and the processes of ownership and appropriation in saying sorry.},
annote = {On the apology Ghassan Hage

Evaluating the significance of the Rudd government's apology to the indigenous people of Australia cannot be but an evaluation of its capacity to contribute to the reversal of the history of colonial racism and some of its particular manifestations that it is trying to address. As such, I want to start with some anthropological questions concerning what defines ourgeneral viability as human beings, and which offer us valuable insights into the nature of racism and its effect on the racialized person. In my work on migration, I have taken seriously the equation of well- being with a sense of mobility that is present in common everyday state- ments such as ‘How is it going?' This equation is present in many other languages and I have tried to work with an understanding that such language of movement is not simply metaphoric but conveys a sense in which, when a person feels well, they actually imagine and feel that they are moving well. I have called this type of imagined/felt movement exis- tential mobility. As with physical mobility, one can experience existential mobility as a result of a force external to oneself, such as with the common migration metaphors of ‘push' or ‘pull', but there is a particular experi- ence of existential mobility that humans favour: it is the feeling of being propelled.
The particularity of being propelled can be easily highlighted by looking at the difference between being propelled and being pushed. Unlike when you receive a push, when you are propelled the force that pushes you stays with you. It is this idea that a force is ‘staying with us', providing us with both power and companionship, that we humans tend to particularly like. This is perhaps what Heidegger refers to as a being-with, Mitsein. We have with each other a co-propelling relation. This is not just an inter-human relation. We feel propelled, when seeing our dog bouncing in the park or indeed when we feel that all of nature is bouncing, such as on a beautiful spring morning.
It seems to me that, at its most fundamental level, racism is a negation and an active severing of this relation that exists between us and others. The deepest form of racism is a mode of perceiving the life of a category of others as a negative force in relation to ours. Racists are like the ‘dementors' of Rowling's Harry Potter novels, instead of sharing with others a co-propelling relation, they suck the life out of the people they racialize. I have no doubt that a whole history of colonial racism towards
Australia's indigenous people can be written as a history of ‘sucking the life out of them'. A non-racist future can be imagined when non-indigenous Australians stop being the ‘dementors' of indigenous Australia and re- constitute a relation where the indigenous and non-indigenous are co- propelling each other. To my mind, the apology, while not enough in itself, has offered a space where such a relation is possible. It is both itself a propelling force and an instigator of the possibility of a co-propelling relation between indigenous and non-indigenous people. Another general anthropological proposition that has proven of general relevance in my work is the conception of subjectivity developed by Lacan in his analysis of the ‘mirror stage'. It is the idea that very early in life the self is structured by a feeling of fragmentation (a feeling of being ‘all over the place') and by the setting of an ideal non-fragmented imageof the self that comes from the outside (the mirror image). I feel frag- mented but everyone and everything from the outside convey to me the sense that I am a whole, so I start trying to become the whole I am expected to be. For Lacan, the subject is this very endless trying to become whole. We are constantly trying to ‘pull ourselves together', so to speak. What defines our well-being here is not only the degree to which we feel we are succeeding in pulling ourselves together but also the degree of anxiety that our struggle to overcome fragmentation induces in us. Some people, because of personal or social circumstances, end up more relaxed about being fragmented than others and though, like everyone, they are trying to overcome fragmentation, they do so with less anxiety. Others feel the world is trying to get them and try to pull themselves together frantically. The pertinence of this conception of subjectivity to understanding racialized people should be obvious. Most people who are subjected to racism experience it as a shattering force: a force that enhances centri- fugal tendencies and feelings of fragmentation within them. This does not mean that racism necessarily shatters people. How shattered a person is will depend on their social and psychological resources. But there is no doubt that people subjected to racism have to engage in a greater psychic effort to pull themselves together, which comes at an immense social and psychological cost to them.
So, what can one say about the apology in relation to such a situation? The first thing one can note is that indigenous people, like most racialized people, are often made to feel that they are living in a hostile environment where they constantly feel vulnerable, and as such their pulling themselves together is always done with a great sense of anxiety. As such, there is no doubt that the apology has helped create a less hostile environment than the one perpetuated by the previous conservative government by its very refusal to apologize. Furthermore, the apology offers what we can call a ‘space of self-constitution', a space which offers a shelter from the frag- menting forces of racism and helps the racialized to pull themselves together with greater ease. Again, this can only be seen as an offering with a positive potential.
Whether the positive potentials of the apology eventuate will depend on social and economic developments that the apology cannot affect. What is certain, however, is the poverty of thinking of those who see the apology as ‘symbolic' as opposed to ‘practical'. The apology will have and has had real practical consequences. It might not be about giving indigenous people jobs or better resources, or dealing with the various social path- ologies that are poisoning their communal life. But it certainly is about reconstituting the psychological injuries that colonial racism has inflicted and continues to inflict on them. The healing of these injuries has serious practical consequences on their capacity to play an active role in reshaping their lives.},

abstract = {Human movement has been studied for decades and dynamic laws of motion that are common to all humans have been derived. Yet, every individual moves differently from everyone else (faster/slower, harder/smoother etc). We propose here a measure of such variability, namely an individual motor signature (IMS) able to capture the subtle differences in the way each of us moves. We show that the IMS of a person is time-invariant and that it significantly differs from those of other individuals. This allows us to quantify the dynamic similarity, a measure of rapport between dynamics of different individuals' movements, and demonstrate that it facilitates coordination during interaction. We use our measure to confirm a key prediction of the theory of similarity that the level of coordination between two individuals performing a joint task is higher if their motions share similar kinematic features. We evaluate the theory by applying it to the "mirror game", a recently proposed paradigm for studying the dynamics of two people improvising motion together. Moreover, we use a virtual avatar driven by an interactive cognitive architecture based on feedback control theory to explore the effects of different kinematic features of the avatar motion on the coordination with human players.},

Our results demonstrate that individuals depleted of self-control resources were more likely to behave dishonestly (Study 1). Depletion reduced people's moral awareness when they faced the opportunity to cheat, which, in turn, was responsible for heightened cheating (Study 2). Individuals high in moral identity, however, did not show elevated levels of cheating when they were depleted (Study 3), supporting our hypothesis that self-control depletion increases cheating when it robs people of the executive resources necessary to identify an act as immoral or unethical. Our results also show that resisting unethical behavior both requires and depletes self-control resources (Study 4). Taken together, our findings help to explain how otherwise ethical individuals predictably engage in unethical behavior. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
annote = {For many, the effort to resist temptation is a constant struggle.
As our results suggest, good intentions cannot guarantee ethical action. Like Mae West, we ‘‘generally avoid temptation, unless [we] can't resist it.''


Unethical behaviors are defined as acts that have harmful effects on others and are ‘‘either illegal or morally unacceptable to the larger community'' (Jones, 1991, p. 367).

Based on this definition, examples of unethical behaviors include violations of ethical norms or standards, cheating, stealing, and other forms of dishonesty


investigate the role of self-control in unethical behavior. Across four laboratory studies, we test the hypothesis that self-control resource depletion in- creases unethical behavior because it reduces the extent to which people can and do recognize the unethicality of the situation.

the detrimental impact of self-control depletion on unethical behavior

we also examine whether resisting the temptation to cheat depletes one's own self-regulatory resources. Taken together, our studies contribute to our theoretical understanding of the role of self-control in explaining unethical behavior and inform prescriptions for curtailing dishonesty.

SELF CONTROL: 
‘‘the ability to override or change one's inner re-
sponses, as well as to interrupt undesired behavioral tendencies (such as impulses) and refrain from acting on them'' (Tangney, Baumeister, {\&} Boone, 2004, p. 274).

The strength model of self-regulation contends that all acts of self-regulation (e.g., refraining from buying a tempting product one does not need) draw from a common yet finite pool of resources, thereby leaving relatively fewer self-regulatory resources available for subsequent acts of self-control (Muraven et al., 1998; Muraven {\&} Baumeister, 2000). 

THE STRENGTH MODEL:
Thus, self-control is impaired when an individual continuously exerts self-control without rest or replenishment, just as a muscle becomes fatigued through exertion (Muraven et al., 1998; Muraven {\&} Baumeister, 2000).

Furthermore, behaviors from seemingly different spheres of self-regulation draw from the same resources, such that a task that involves controlling emotion can cause impairment on a subse- quent task requiring persistence

compared to people who have not recently had to self-regulate their behavior, people who have had to self-regulate their behavior are more likely to overeat, procrastinate, or shop impulsively


Muraven, Pogarsky, and Shmueli (2006) measured trait self-control and found that both trait self-control and self-control depletion predicted cheating behavior on a problem-solving task.

Mead et al. (2009) also found that individuals were more likely to misrepre- sent their performance for financial gain when their self-control re- sources were depleted than when they were not depleted


Effective self-regulation involves three main components: 

1. standards, 
2.monitoring 
3. strength (see Baumeister {\&} Bushman, 2010). 

standards, refers to goals or rules that drive individuals' behavior regarding what are appropriate or moral actions, and it is often determined by cultural norms. 

monitoring, consists in keeping track of the actions individuals want to regulate so that they can achieve their goals and standards. People typically monitor themselves through a feedback loop which, in the self-regulation literature, is referred to as the ‘‘test-operate-test-exit'' loop (TOTE, see Carver {\&} Scheier, 1981, 1982).
In this feedback model, people compare their actions to their standards or goals

If there is a discrepancy between current ac- tions and standards (e.g., behaving selfishly when one wants to be a generous person), then people move to the ‘‘operate'' phase in which they exert conscious self-control to change their behavior so that their actions are in line with their goals (Dissonance reduction)

if the person finds that the behavior meets the standards, then she can complete the loop by exiting it

self-regulation works by comparing the self's current actions with pre-determined goals, and if the self falls short, some change would be made to bring about the desired state

The third component of effective self-regulation is the capacity for change, also known as willpower. This component is particularly important in understanding what occurs during the ‘‘operate'' phase of the TOTE loop

When people's self-control is depleted, their cognitive resources are taxed and, as a result, their executive functioning is hindered (Schmeichel et al., 2003)

individuals whose self-regulatory resources are depleted are more likely to act unethically because these individuals do not have the executive resources to identify moral issues in the situation they are facing and to test their behavior against an external moral standard

More recently, Reynolds (2006) defined moral awareness as ‘‘a person's determination that a situation contains moral content and legitimately can be considered from a moral point of view'' (p. 233). A person can thus exhibit different patterns of moral awareness in different situations (Trevi{\~{n}}o, 1986).

systematic processing results in greater recognition of moral issues in a given situation (Street, Douglas, Geiger, {\&} Martinko, 2001; Swanson {\&} Hill, 1993), relative to peripheral processing of information. Given that moral aware- ness relies on the very same cognitive resources that are taxed by self-regulatory resource depletion, we hypothesize that self- control resource depletion may reduce people's ability to recognize and reason through a moral issue. 

Hypothesis 2: Self-regulatory resource depletion impairs moral awareness.

Perhaps even more problematic, individuals who fail to recognize the moral aspect of an issue, decision, or situation will not activate the moral decision-making script (Jones, 1991; Street et al., 2001).


Thus, when moral awareness is impaired, ethics-re- lated constructs are less likely to be activated and available in their minds, and, as a result, individuals are more likely to behave unethically

Hypothesis 3: The impaired ability to recognize moral issues mediates the relationship between self-regulatory resource depletion and unethical behavior

MODERATOR: self-importance of moral identity moderates the relationship between self-regulatory resource depletion and unethical behavior.

individuals with a strong moral identity consider moral concerns and commitments to be central to their self-concept (Aquino {\&} Reed, 2002), and are characterized by high moral self-regulation (Bandura, 1991).

they are able to recognize their own moral objectives and social expectations by processing pre-existing moral conceptions and affective states.

With high moral self-regulation, people are able to extract, weigh, and integrate morally relevant information when facing moral dilemmas before deciding upon a course of action.

Individuals high in moral identity have strongly internalized moral standards and thus do not need to ex- pend cognitive resources when thinking through the decision of how to resolve ethical dilemmas.


Greene and Paxton (2009) found that indi- viduals who behaved honestly in a task where cheating was possi- ble did not engage in controlled cognitive processes

This suggests that ‘‘honest'' individ- uals automatically recognized the immorality of cheating on the given task and were not tempted by the opportunity for dishonest gain.

By contrast, individuals who behaved dishonestly exhibited increased activity in controlled cognitive processes, suggesting that they used cognitive resources to think through the decision of whether to behave unethically or not.

Individuals who behave honestly
may not need to rely on their self-control in order to resist the temptation to cheat, since they strongly value morality and do not to use their cognitive resources to recognize and reason through moral issues.

It is quite possible that only individuals with a low moral identity may need to overcome the temptation to cheat when the situation allows for cheating and use cognitive re- sources to think through moral dilemmas

As suggested earlier, ethical behavior may break down because depleted individuals do not have the executive resources to identify moral issues and to test their behavior against an external moral standard.

Hypothesis 4: Moral identity moderates the relationshipbetween self-regulatory resource depletion and unethical behavior. Specifically, this relationship is weaker for individuals with high moral identity than it is for individuals with low moral identity.


Discussion:

we found that individuals with
depleted self-regulatory resources are more likely to engage in unethical behavior than individuals without depleted self-regulatory resources.

refraining from unethical behavior both requires and depletes self-regulatory resources

Participants with depleted self-control were more likely to behave unethically by lying about their performance on a problem-solving task compared to participants whose self-control was not depleted (Study 1).

They were also less likely to recognize unethical behav- ior because ethics-related concepts were less accessible in their minds when they faced the opportunity to cheat, indicating that their moral awareness was impaired (Study 2)

This impaired mor- al awareness when facing ethical dilemmas mediated the relation- ship between self-regulatory resource depletion and unethical behavior (Study 2).

Moral identity moderated the relationship between self-regulatory resource depletion and dishonesty, such that this relationship was weaker for participants with high moral identity (Study 3): 
- Participants with high moral identity were less likely than those with low moral identities to act unethically, especially when their self-control resources were depleted.

Finally, our results show that resisting unethical behavior depleted participants' self-control resources (Study 4).

Our study contributes to knowledge about the role of self-regulation processes in promoting and discouraging unethical behavior on several fronts

Building on prior research (e.g., Mead et al., 2009; Muraven et al., 2006), we identified an important mechanism explaining this relationship. We proposed and found that self-control resource depletion impairs moral awareness and negatively impacts the ability of individuals to recognize moral issues.

We find that moral iden- tity moderates the effects of self-regulatory resource depletion on unethical behavior; when moral identity is salient and central to an individual's self-concept, self-regulation is less important for curtailing unethical behavior.

Third, we demonstrate that resisting unethical behavior con-
sumes self-regulatory resources. This finding suggests that good conduct that involves refraining from unethical behavior may re- sult in subsequent cheating

Thus, just as moral credits may promote subsequent unethical behavior, resisting the temptation to cheat depletes self-control resources and may thus increase the likelihood of a subsequent ethical failure.

debated whether unethical behavior is primarily a result of character flaws (‘‘bad apples'' ap- proach), situational influences (‘‘bad barrel'' approach) or both (see, for example, Trevi{\~{n}}o's (1986) person–situation interactionist model, or Jones' (1991) issue-contingent model)

Our findings offer strong support for a person-situation interactionist model: situa- tional influences (e.g., the presence of rewards, or monitoring) may trigger an individual's self-motives to become more salient

Our re- sults suggest that cheating may be the result of a self-regulatory failure: when self-control resources are depleted, people do not have enough cognitive resources to recognize the moral compo- nent of the decision they are facing, and thus give into the tempta- tion to cheat.

Previous research on self-control has demonstrated that self- regulatory resource depletion does not affect simple information processing (e.g., Schmeichel et al., 2003), which may be involved when people face simple rather than complex ethical dilemmas},

annote = {beliefs in moralistic, punitive and knowing gods increase impartial behaviour towards distant co-religionists, and therefore can contribute to the expansion of prosociality.


standard evolutionary explanations of prosociality because well-studied mechanisms of cooperation based on genetic relatedness, reciprocity and partner choice falter as people increasingly engage in fleeting transactions with genetically unrelated strangers in large anonymous groups

To explain this rapid expansion of prosociality, researchers have proposed several mechanisms3,4. 

Here we focus on one key hypothesis: cognitive representations of gods as increasingly knowledgeable and punitive, and who sanction violators of interpersonal social norms, foster and sustain the expansion of cooperation, trust and fairness towards co-religionist strangers


the higher participants rated their moralistic gods as punitive and knowledgeable about human thoughts and actions, the more coins they allocated to geographically distant co-religionist strangers relative to both themselves and local co-religionists


TRUST versus RECIPROCITY (fusion versus pro-sociality)


People may trust in, cooperate with and interact fairly within wider social circles, partly because they believe that knowing gods will punish them if they do not

through increased frequency and consistency in belief and behaviour sets, commitments to the same gods coordinate people's expectations about social interactions

GROUP LEVEL:
harnessed and exploited aspects of our evolved psychology, such as mentalizing abilities, dualistic tendencies and sensitivity to norm com- pliance, to gradually assemble configurations of supernatural beliefs that promote greater cooperation and trust within expanding groups, leading to greater success in intergroup competition

INDIVIDUAL LEVEL:
Of course, given that cultural evolution can produce self-reinforcing stable patterns of beliefs and practices, these supernatural agent concepts may also have been individually favoured within groups due to mechanisms related to signalling, reputation and punishment5–9,11,12.

we combined two behavioural experiments with detailed ethnographic interviews to assess whether participants who report that their moralistic gods are punishing and more knowledgeable about human thought and behaviour are more likely to impartially allocate money to anonymous, geographically distant co-religionists over both themselves and their local community6,7

To measure favouritism towards oneself and local community under maximally anonymous conditions, we modified the random allocation game

Participants played two counterbalanced games for a total of 60 coin allocations per person (Fig. 1). In one game, 

Game 1:
the local co-religionist game, participants chose between a cup assigned to an unspecified anonymous co-religionist from their local community and a cup assigned to an anonymous co-religionist living in a geographically distant community that does not regularly interact with the player's community. 

Game 2:
the self game, participants chose between a cup for themselves and a cup for another anonymous distant co-religionist.

RESULTS:
When people report not knowing if a god punishes, they put considerably fewer coins in the cups for distant co-religionists in both games (local co- religionist game: M = 12.97, s.d. = 4.33; self game: M = 12.50, s.d. = 4.15) than those who consistently report that their god punishes (local co-religionist game: M = 14.58, s.d. = 3.24; self game: M = 14.53,

Based on previous work9,29, we suspected that material insecurity and number of children would increase self and local favouritism, and therefore

Across a wide range of specifications and models including a host of variables (for example, divine rewards, emotional closeness to distant co-religionists, among others), both moralistic gods' punishment and knowledge, as well as our aggregate punishment–knowledge variable, are reliably associated with less bias against distant co-religionists (Supplementary Tables S5–S9).},

abstract = {Choice, active response, self-regulation, and other volition may all draw on a common inner resource. In Experiment 1, people who forced themselves to eat radishes instead of tempting chocolates subsequently quit faster on unsolvable puzzles than people who had not had to exert self-control over eating. In Experiment 2, making a meaningful personal choice to perform attitude-relevant behavior caused a similar decrement in persistence. In Experiment 3, suppressing emotion led to a subsequent drop in performance of solvable anagrams. In Experiment 4, an initial task requiring high self-regulation made people more passive (i.e., more prone to favor the passive-response option). These results suggest that the self's capacity for active volition is limited and that a range of seemingly different, unrelated acts share a common resource.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate how experience and feedback influence pacing and performance during time trial cycling. DESIGN: Twenty-nine cyclists performed three 20 km cycling time trials using a Computrainer. The first two time trials (TT1 and TT2) were performed (1) without any performance feedback (n = 10), (2) with accurate performance feedback (n = 10) or (3) with false feedback showing the speed to be 5{\%} greater than the actual speed (n = 9). All participants received full feedback during the third time trial (TT3), and their performance and pacing data were compared against TT2. RESULTS: Completion time, average power and average speed did not change among the false feedback group, but their pacing strategy did change as indicated by a lower average cadence, 89.2 (SD 5.2) vs 96.4 (6.8) rpm, p{\textless}0.05, and higher power during the first 5 km (SMD = 39, 36, 36, 27 and 27 W for 1-5 km respectively). Pacing changed among the blind feedback group indicated by a faster completion time, 35.9 (3.1) vs 36.8 (4.4) min, p{\textless}0.05, and power increases during the final 5 km (SMD = 14, 13, 18, 23 and 53 W for 16-20 km respectively). No performance or pacing changes were observed among the accurate feedback group. CONCLUSIONS: Pacing is influenced by an interaction between feedback and previous experience. Conscious cognitive processes that lead to ratings of perceived exertion and pacing appear to be influenced by previous experience.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fatigue occurs earlier when working at corresponding exercise intensities in hot compared with cool conditions. Psychological skills training (PST) can modify the responses evoked by thermal stimuli such as the respiratory responses on immersion to cold water. This study tested the hypothesis that a 4-d PST package would significantly increase the distance covered during 90 min of running in the heat. METHOD: Eighteen subjects completed three maximal-effort runs (R1, R2, R3) of 90 min in the heat (30 degrees C; 40{\%} RH). After R2, subjects were matched and randomly allocated to either a control group (CG) or psychological skills group (PSG). Between R2 and R3, the CG (N = 8) continued their normal activities, and the PSG (N = 10) received PST to help them tolerate unpleasant sensations arising from exercising in the heat, and to suppress the temptation to lower their work intensity. Key measures include distance covered, .VO2, skin (T(sk)) and aural temperature (T(au)), RPE, sweat production and evaporation, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prolactin (PRL) in whole blood. RESULTS: The distances covered in the CG did not differ between runs. In the PSG, there were no differences in the distance run between R1 and R2, but they ran significantly farther in R3 (8{\%}; 1.15 km); there were no between-group differences. There were no significant differences between R1 and R3 in peak T(au), T(sk), sweat volumes, IL-6, and PRL (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in either group. CONCLUSION: PST suppressed the temptation to reduce exercise intensity during R3. It is concluded that PST can improve running performance in the heat. The precise mechanisms underpinning these improvements are unclear; however, their implications for unblinded experimental design are not.},

Proponents offer explanatory accounts of the content and transmission of religious thought and behavior in terms of underlying cognition. A central claim is that the cross-cultural recurrence and historical persistence of religion is attributable to the cognitive naturalness of religious ideas, i.e., attributable to the readiness, the ease, and the speed with which human minds acquire and process popular religious representations. In this article, we primarily provide an introductory summary of foundational questions, assumptions, and hypotheses in this field, including some discussion of features distinguishing cognitive science approaches to religion from established psychological approaches. Relevant ethnographic and experimental evidence illustrate and substantiate core claims. Finally, we briefly consider the broader implications of these cognitive approaches for the appropriateness of ‘religion' as an explanatorily useful category in the social sciences.},

@article{McCauley2011,
abstract = {The battle between religion and science, competing methods of knowing ourselves and our world, has been raging for many centuries. Now scientists themselves are looking at cognitive foundations of religion-and arriving at some surprising conclusions. Over the course of the past two decades, scholars have employed insights gleaned from cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines to illuminate the study of religion. In Why Religion is Natural and Science Is Not, Robert N. McCauley, one of the founding fathers of the cognitive science of religion, argues that our minds are better suited to religious belief than to scientific inquiry. Drawing on the latest research and illustrating his argument with commonsense examples, McCauley argues that religion has existed for many thousands of years in every society because the kinds of explanations it provides are precisely the kinds that come naturally to human minds. Science, on the other hand, is a much more recent and rare development because it reaches radical conclusions and requires a kind of abstract thinking that only arises consistently under very specific social conditions. Religion makes intuitive sense to us, while science requires a lot of work. McCauley then draws out the larger implications of these findings. The naturalness of religion, he suggests, means that science poses no real threat to it, while the unnaturalness of science puts it in a surprisingly precarious position. Rigorously argued and elegantly written, this provocative book will appeal to anyone interested in the ongoing debate between religion and science, and in the nature and workings of the human mind.},

@article{Atran2004,
annote = {The criterion (2) of costly commitment rules out cogni-
tive theories of religion as inadequate, however insightful they may be.

Cognitive theories attempt to explain religious belief and practice as cultural manipulations of ordinary psychological processes of categorization, reasoning, and remembering (Andresen 2000; Atran {\&} Sperber 1991; Bar- rett 2000; Boyer 1994; Lawson {\&} McCauley 1990; Pyysi{\"{a}}i- nen {\&} Anttonen 2002).

They do not account for the emotional involvement that leads people to sacrifice to others what is dear to themselves, including labor, limb, and life.
Such theories are often short on motive and are unable to distinguish Mickey Mouse from Moses, cartoon fantasy from religious belief (Atran


In this “mentalist” tra- dition, the focus so far has been on cognition and culture; that is, on how religious ideas are mentally constructed, transmitted across minds, and acquired developmentally. To be sure, there have been recent attempts by cognitive scientists studying religion to consider the role of emotion, and growing realization that religion cannot have a purely cognitive explanation that fails to take into account the so- cial dilemmas motivating religious beliefs and practices (McCauley {\&} Lawson 2002; Pyysi{\"{a}}nnen 2001; Whitehouse 2000).

Religions invoke supernatural agents (Horton 1967; Tylor 1871/1958) to deal with (3) emotionally eruptive exis- tential anxieties (Malinowski 1922/1961), such as death and deception (Becker 1973; Feuerbach 1843/1972; Freud 1913/1990).

Supernatural agent concepts trigger our naturally selected agency-detection system, which is trip-wired to respond to fragmentary information, inciting perception of figures lurking in shad- ows and emotions of dread or awe (Guthrie 1993; cf. Hume 1757/1956).

Conceptions of the supernatural invariably involve the in- terruption or violation of universal cognitive principles that govern ordinary human perception and understanding of the everyday world.

THEREFORE: religious beliefs and ex- periences cannot be reliably validated (or disconfirmed as false) through consistent logical deduction or consistent em- pirical induction. Validation occurs only by (4) collectively satisfying the emotions that motivate religion in the first place. 

Through a “collective effervescence” (Durkheim 1912/1995), communal rituals rhythmically coordinate emotional validation of, and commitment to, moral truths in worlds governed by supernatural agents.

Rituals involve sequential, socially interactive movement and gesture, and formulaic utterances that synchronize affective states among group members in displays of cooperative commitment.

Through the sensory pageantry of movement, sound, smell, touch, and sight, religious rituals affectively coordi- nate actors' minds and bodies into convergent expressions of public sentiment (Turner 1969) – a sort of N-person bond- ing that communicates moral consensus as sacred, transcending all reason and doubt (Rappaport 1999).


kin altruism may also enhance the individual's “inclusive fitness” by allowing surviving relatives to pass on many of the individual's genes to future generations (Hamilton 1964). But what motivates the sort of non-kin co- operation characteristic of human religious commitment?


In the case of religiously inspired suicide terrorism, these sentiments are purposely manipulated by organizational lead- ers, recruiters, and trainers to the advantage of the manipu- lating elites rather than the individual (much as the fast-food or soft-drink industries manipulate innate desires for natu- rally scarce commodities like fatty foods and sugar to ends that reduce personal fitness but benefit the manipulating in- stitution). No “group selection” is involved, only cognitive and emotional manipulation of some individuals by others.

Often the naturally eruptive anxieties that bring on the supernatural are artificially (purposely) excited, then assuaged (Durkheim 1912/1995)

RITES OF TERROR:

These arouse existential anxieties by culturally mimicking and manipulating seemingly capricious and uncontrollable situations that naturally provoke them: terror and risk of death from unidentifiable sources, the menace of infirmity and starvation through physical ordeal and deprivation, the injustice of whimsical oppression, sudden isolation, and loneliness

Often initiates temporarily manifest behaviors and cognitions associated with persons clinically diagnosed as suffering abuse, stress, or trauma, including re-experi- encing the events (nightmares, intrusive memories, flash- backs), avoidance (amnesia of the event, refusal to talk or think about it), and hyperarousal (startle response, fitful sleep, poor concentration) (cf. Newport {\&} Nemeroff 2000).

Stress sufferers who permanently lose memory and undergo reduced immune response often suffer from chronic stress and lack of effective social support (Dhabar {\&} McEwen 1999; Khansari et al. 1990). By contrast, even the most severe and emotionally aversive religious initia- tions end in positive exhibitions of social acceptance

Through the stress that these exaggerated sensual displays induce, rites of passage furnish emotionally costly and memorable – but ultimately satisfying – commitments to the group and its supernatural agents.

Collective religious ritual always seems to involve ancestrally primitive communicative forms that Tinbergen calls “ritualized social releasers” (1951, p. 191–92). Social re- leasers exhibit sense-evident properties, “either of shape, or colour, or special movements, or sound, or scents,” which readily elicit a well-timed and well-oriented cooperative re- sponse in a conspecific: for mating, parenting, fighting, de- fense, food gathering, and the like. But humans appear to be the only animals that spontaneously engage in creative, rhythmic bodily coordination to enhance cooperation. Un- like, say, avian mating calls or flight formations, human mu- sic or body dance, which are omnipresent in worship, can be arbitrarily and creatively recomposed.

MUSIC

Expression of religious pre- scriptions performatively signals and establishes cognitive and emotional commitment to seek convergence, but it doesn't specify (the propositional content of) what people should converge to. The truth about religious prescriptions is accepted on faith and communicated through ritual dis- play, not discovered or described as a set of factual or logical propositions.

The result of such convergence is to per- petuate a stable community of cooperators who sacrifice for the group in the short run, but benefit from it in the long run.

that understanding
agency, together with metarepresenting false belief and de- ceit, emerged as a later development of intentional com- municative displays that signaled possibilities for hominids to cooperate (or deceive) in a wide variety of situations (Leslie {\&} Frith 1987).


In pretense, a person believes that [p is false] because
not-p is demonstrably or verifiably the case. In faith, a per- son believes that [p is true] because p is the Word of God, and because God always speaks the truth.

religious acts of faith involve exagger-
ated gestures that are intended to connote a situation that goes beyond the one perceptually manifest.

Given the ever-present menace of enemies within and with- out, concealment, deception, and the ability to both gener- ate and recognize false beliefs in others would favor sur- vival. But because human representations of agency and intention include representations of false belief and decep- tion, human society is forever under threat of moral defection.

Invoking supernatural agents who may have true beliefs that people ordinarily lack creates the arational conditions for people to steadfastly commit to one another in a moral order that goes beyond apparent reason and self-conscious interest. In the limiting case, an omni- scient and omnipotent agent (e.g., the supreme deity of the Abrahamic religions) can ultimately detect and punish cheaters, defectors, and free riders no matter how devious (cf. Frank 1988; Dennett 1997).

In the competition for moral allegiance, secular ideolo-
gies are at a disadvantage. For, if people learn that all ap- parent commitment is self-interested convenience or worse, manipulation for the self-interest of others, then their commitment is debased and withers. Especially in times of vulnerability and stress, social deception and de- fection in the pursuit of self-preservation is therefore more likely to occur, as Ibn Khaldun recognized centuries ago (Ibn Khaldun 1318/1958, II, iii, p. 41). 

Religion passionately rouses hearts and minds to break out of this viciously rational cycle of self-interest and to adopt group interests that may benefit individuals in the long run. Commitment

Commitment to the supernatural underpins the “organic solidarity” (Durkheim 1912/1995) that makes social life more than simply a contract among calculating individuals. Commit- ment to the supernatural is further sustained by the relieving of pervasive existential anxieties, to

If supernatural agents are cognitively salient and possess omniscient and omnipotent powers, then they can be in- voked to ease existential anxieties such as death and decep- tion that forever threaten human life everywhere.

emotionally eruptive existential anxieties moti- vate supernatural beliefs.

Religion has no evolutionary function per se. It is rather that existential anxieties and moral sentiments constitute – by virtue of evolution – in- eluctable elements of the human condition; and that the cognitive invention, cultural selection, and historical sur- vival of religious beliefs have resulted, in part, from success in accommodating these elements.

One such evolutionary ridge en- compasses panhuman emotional faculties, or “affect pro- grams.” Some of these affect programs, such as surprise and fear, date at least to the emergence of reptiles. Others, such as grief and guilt, may be unique to humans.

Another ridge includes social-interaction schema. Some schema may go far back in evolutionary time, such as those involved in de- tecting predators and seeking protectors, or which govern direct “tit-for-tat” reciprocity (“you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours”).

Other social-interaction schema seem unique to humans, such as committing to non-kin. 

Still an- other ridge encompasses panhuman mental faculties, or cognitive modules, like folkmechanics, folkbiology, folkpsy- chology. Folkmechanics is this ridge's oldest part, with links to amphibian brains.

Folkpsychology is the newest, fore- shadowed among apes. Only humans appear to metarepre- sent multiple models of other minds and worlds (Tomasello et al. 1993), including the supernatural.

Nevertheless, all religions follow the same structural con-
tours. They invoke supernatural agents to deal with emo- tionally eruptive existential anxieties, such as loneliness, calamity, and death. They have malevolent and predatory deities as well as more benevolent and protective ones. These systematically, but minimally, violate modularized expectations about folkmechanics, folkbiology, and folkpsy- chology. And religions communally validate counterintu- itive beliefs through musical rituals and other rhythmic co- ordinations of affective body states. Finally, these landscape features are mutually constraining. They include evolved constraints on emotional feelings and displays, modularized conceptual and mnemonic processing, and social commit- ments that attend to information about cooperators, pro- tectors, predators, and prey.},

Eroticism is arrived at and defined by the high amount of energy displayed in animal sexuality. We propose that the unique human emotional intelligence is due to this “overflow” of mating energy. What from the survival viewpoint looks like an enormous waste of time and energy reveals itself to be an unexpected psychological benefit. The diversion of sexual energy from procreation—a process that results in erotic fantasies—turns intimacy into a source of human self-consciousness. This places different emphasis on the meaning of eroticism and provides a coherent scenario of mental development beyond mere cognitive capacities. Arguments are presented on how erotic imagination, or sexual excitation as an end in itself, promotes the human propensity for explorative curiosity; data from ethology, psychology, sociology, and neuroscience are presented to support these arguments. As philosophical anthropologists, we do not provide new empirical data, but the available results of comparative behavioral research confirm our hypothesis.},

Human societies are complex, with more specialized economic niches in the United States than the total number of mammalian species on the planet.5 While some might suggest that only post-industrial humans achieved stunning biological success, data suggest that humans living as hunter-gatherers would have attained a world population of more than 70 million individuals6 and a total biomass greater than that of any other large vertebrate on the planet if agriculture had not been repeatedly invented as they spread.},
annote = {2Why did this suite of traits evolve in humans and not in other animals? 

3Why did they evolve when and where they did, not earlier, later, or in a different ecolog- ical context?

1: extensive reliance on social learning, resulting in cumulative adaptive change in extrasomatically stored information. This system of informational evolution is the dominant force of adaptation in humans, but no other species.

The proclivity for imi- tation in combination with guided modification and powerful transmis- sion biases leads to special evolution- ary trajectories of behavior unantici- pated by standard behavioral biology.

The capacity for high-fidelity social transmission has produced a complex symbolic communication system that allows transfer of information about events not directly observed (or observable) by either party.

2: The other characteristic is extraordinary cooperation between nonkin, including specialization, a regular flow of goods and services between individuals and groups (Fig. 1), and the formation of increasingly complex alliance networks. 

Human cul- tural conventions solve the problem of reliably and stably associating cooperating individuals with each other

A long natural history of within-group cooperation has led to cultural and biological co-evolution that produced emotional mecha- nisms facilitating cooperative behav- ior between kin and nonkin includ- ing morality, fairness, justice, anger, indignation, guilt, and the emergence of universal human traits such as ethnicity and religion

Culture is information (beliefs) stored in brains, institutions, and material goods that is transmitted socially and influences behavior

Because cultural variants, like genes, are units of information that influ- ence their own transmission, their frequencies change through time and culture evolves

genetic alleles and cultural variants interact with environment and each other to produce observed behavioral phenotypes

Because social learning mechanisms are shaped by genetic evolution, but also influence the rela- tive advantage of alternative geno- types, genes and culture co-evolve

Research in experimental psychology is beginning to elucidate differences in learning mechanisms that may explain why only human social learning is cumulative

Although learning by imitation is
critical to cumulative culture, chimpanzees, too, learn by watching a model, yet do not have cumulative culture.

Experiments suggest that chimpanzees are more inclined to emulation, or learning to get the desired result, rather than imitation, copying the precise means.

For exam- ple, Horner and Whiten33 conducted experiments showing that human children copy unrewarded actions presented by an adult model, whereas chimpanzees quickly eliminate actions that are superfluous to obtaining the reward.

Children not only copy model actions precisely, but simultaneously incorpo- rate an emotional reaction that to do things otherwise is ‘‘wrong.''36

Tomasello34 concludes that human
social learning includes an excep- tional focus on actions rather than just goals

Nevertheless, chimpanzee ‘‘emulation'' results in transmission of behavior with notable fidelit
across a chain of individuals within a social group and between social groups that observe each other.37

This allows some traditions to spread through space and time. However, follow-up experiments have shed additional light on critical differences between chimpanzees and humans. For example, chimpanzees imitate behaviors that provide immediate rewards but are reluctant to adopt subsequent new behaviors that can provide even higher rewards.

For example, humans regularly engage in ‘‘teaching,'' but none of the apes have been observed to do so.

Human imitation also includes multiple transmission biases, such as conformity bias, success and prestige bias, and similarity bias, which may be critical to explaining cumulative culture in our species

For example, Boyd and Richer- son40 demonstrated that the selection force on social learning depends on the amount of previously existing useful culture to copy

If imitation capacity is mainly adaptive when present at a high frequency, how would it get started?


Hill proposed that human ‘‘culture'' is conceptually distinct from animal traditions because it consists of three components universally present in all human societies: 
1. socially learned techniques and technologies; 
2. socially learned regulation of behavior (norms, conven- tions, rules, laws) achieved through third-party rewards and punish- ments; and 
3. symbolic and emotional reinforcement of, and signaling adherence to, a specific rule system (ritual, morality, religion, ethnicity).

The second and third components on this list have not been described in nonhuman animals. 

The transmission of these components may rely on unique cognitive adaptations for transmission by teaching.

Members of human societies contin- uously negotiate conventions that limit within-group competition and promote within-group cooperation

The learning of such conventions may rely on teaching, as well as con- formist and success-biased transmis- sion, and may result in the spread of group-beneficial norms through a process of cultural group selection, something that is unknown for any other species

hunter-gatherer societies, where socially learned norms regulate competition over valu- able biological resources and promote cooperation.

Indeed, all hunter-gath- erer societies develop regulations28 that control access to things such as mates, food patches, already-acquired foods, signaling opportunities, kin and allies, and political power.

Such regulations also govern acceptable expression of conflict (Fig. 3), age-sex- structured behavioral patterns, and public health hazards.

Cultural norms are reaffirmed and re- inforced symbolically through ritual and, because interaction with others ‘‘playing by the same rules'' is advanta- geous, ethnic signaling is universal in human societies (Fig. 4).

When people become experts at playing the game of life by a specific set of rules, they internalize a commitment to those rules (morality) and react emotionally against any violations that threaten to bring change

When people become experts at playing the game of life by a specific set of rules, they internalize a commitment to those rules (morality) and react emo- tionally against any violations that threaten to bring change

It has long been argued that language is what makes us human and sets us apart from other animals. But language appears to be a cognitive offshoot of social learning.

Human language:
1.communicative intentions, 
2. capacity for reference, and 
3. production and interpretation of structured sequences

The first of these may be derived from cooperative breeding, while the second and third components are part of the high-fidelity social learning mechanisms that humans apply to all cultural transmission

Surprisingly, behavior often seems designed to promote group wel- fare. Hunter-gatherer societies show numerous cooperative institutions, from social status leveling48,49 and alloparental caretaking50 to between- group exchange,51 cooperative food acquisition,15 and extensive, even gen- eralized food redistribution.

But not until the emergence of experimental economics did it become clear that the predicted Nash equilibrium behaviors, from economics, or evolu- tionary stable strategies, from biology, based on assumptions of self-inter- ested actors, systematically failed to predict human behavior.

For example, despite mythology to the contrary, people frequently cooperate rather than defect in the one-shot Prisoners Dilemma.53

They also expect others to cooperate if they have met or talked with them. Experimental subjects indicate that they prefer the cooperate-cooperate outcome over the defect-cooperate outcome that would provide them higher pay-offs.

They make generous offers far above the predicted equilibrium in Ultimatum games and reject ‘‘unfair'' offers despite a substantial loss of potential resources.

Finally, contributions to Public Goods (in games and real life) are notably higher than the expected zero contribution predicted by for- mal rational actor models.57

More recent theoretical exploration has uncovered a universal ‘‘core dilemma of cooperation''—condi- tions that, when met, can lead to the evolution of altruistic cooperation in any species.

Mathematical models derived from the Price equation63 unite kin selection, reciprocal altruism, group selection, indirect reciprocity, and norm-based cooper- ation into a single framework and demonstrate that any mechanism that regularly associates acting altruistically with being the recipient of altruistic behavior can favor the evolution of cooperation.11:35–74,215–218

All cooperative mechanisms proposed either increase the direct fitness of the actor or can be explained by inclusive fitness effects.

Despite the debate over its ultimate causality, however, the observations of third-party punishment in experi- ments have led theorists to explore how cooperation might be achieved through such punishment

‘‘Strong reciprocity'' 79:169 is defined as ‘‘a propensity to reward those who behave cooperatively and to punish those who violate norms of acceptable behavior, even when reward and punishment cannot be justified in terms of self-regarding, outcome-oriented preferences.'

Similarly, terms such as ‘‘other-regarding preference'' and ‘‘prosociality'' describe the proclivity to take into account the payoffs to other individuals as well as to ones self in cooperative dilemmas

Third-party punishment, strong reciprocity, and pervasive prosocial tendencies appear to be derived features of the genus Homo, since chimpanzees, unlike humans, do not punish ‘‘unfairness'' or the lack of other-regarding behavior by compa- triots,80

Prosociality in humans as compared to other apes may be related to cognitive features of our species, such as greater cognitive ability in cooperative realms

Most importantly, the evolved taste for ‘‘fairness'' in dyadic and small-scale interpersonal interaction appears to be directly related to evolved neural mechanisms84,85 that are also are activated in the application of pun- ishment by impartial judges in mod- ern legal systems.86


Pre-adaptations for human uniqueness?

First, hominins are bipedal and, as a result, cover geographical ranges far larger than other apes do.

Even hunter-gatherers living in tropical forests have daily home ranges that are two to three times those of chim- panzees, and lifetime home ranges more than two orders of magnitude greater. 

Thus, Thus, individual hominins faced more environmental vari- ability than do chimpanzees.

Second, bipedal hominins evolved exceptional manual dexterity because their hands were freed from locomotory constraints, and they could carry tools with little cost. This would have favored increased tool using and making behavior and probably increased selection pressure on imitative capacities as well

Third, by at least 2 million years ago, hominins had begun to depend on high-quality, widely dispersed resources that were difficult to obtain

Juveniles could not fully feed themselves due to the complexity of the extractive niche, and this led to their provisioning by close kin

This pattern would have provisioned children, but also allowed temporarily sick or injured adults to obtain food until recovery.


COOPERATIVE BREEDING:
Recently, a full appreciation of the implications of cooperative breeding has tied this pattern to the evolution of prosocial behaviors and emotions, as well as many features of human life his- tory.

FOOD PROVISIONING:
The Ache and Hiwi data suggest
that nuclear families in hunter-gath- erer societies are not capable of pro- ducing sufficient resources to sustain typical fertility and child survivor- ship rates through the entire life span (Fig. 6).

Instead, all breeding pairs experience runs of bad luck, ill health, and an unsupportable off- spring dependency load in mid-life that is covered by food transfers from other adults

long-term provisioning probably is not explained by ‘‘tolerated theft'' or costly signaling.113 Instead, kin-biased group composition, pay-to-stay arrangements,114 benefits of group augmentation,97 indirect reci- procity,113 between-group competi- tion,67 and cultural group selec- tion42,43 may be required to explain generalized reciprocity within residential bands.

Thus, menopause may be an adaptation to provisioning patterns and subsequently result in further provisioning (by postreproductives)

Behavioural implications of cooperative breeding: 
Studies show that cooperative breeding species often develop task specialization, effective communication, amplified prosocial behavior, and facilitation of social learning

Many cooperative breeders show incipient social norms, such as regulations about who can breed and what types of helping are required, which are backed by punishment from both breeders

Active demonstration of behavior by altruistic mod- els (teaching) is also mainly limited to cooperative breeding species.

cooperative breeding results in social clustering of individuals with a strong impetus to read each others' intentions to coordinate effectively in reaching shared goals. This may provide the ‘‘communicative intentions'' necessary for the evolution of language.

Thus, we suggest that cooperative breeding may explain the large gap in ‘‘shared intentionality''124 and exceptional cooperative, but not competitive, social intelligence that distinguishes human and chimpan- zee cognitive abilities.87

Apes have notable social learning skills, but they often view behavioral models as potential competitors rather than helpers, and try to deceive or manipulate them.

Humans, on the other hand, imitate while presuming that the model intends to help them rather than to compete.

This may explain why human children precisely imitate rather than simply emulate to reach a goal.33 Children often assume that a ‘‘teacher'' has their best interest at heart and intentionally demonstrates useful behavior.

This may also explain why children readily imitate newly introduced behaviors despite already having learned other solutions to a problem, whereas chimpanzees do not.34


BEHAVIORAL MODERNITY AND HUMAN UNIQUENESS:
Dental development and brain growth patterns increasingly suggest that early Homo exhibited a life his- tory closer to the faster juvenile growth of apes than to the slower growth rates of modern humans.

Available data may imply, however, that a human- like life history had emerged by the Middle Pleistocene if slow juvenile growth is shared by both Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.128,129

However, some evidence suggests that Neanderthals did not have a slow life history like humans,130 so the timing of life-history change remains uncertain.

Provisioning of juveniles and slow life history is more likely in the context of home-base camps where food is shared among camp occupants. 

Not until the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene is it probable that accumulations of artifacts and ani- mal bones in cave and shelter locales,133 as well as evidence of hearths with animal and plant food consumption, tool making, and other activities,134
indicate residential camps to which humans repeatedly returned to share food and other resources.

Paleoanthropological data may eventually indicate the beginnings of provisioning of disabled adults as well, which is critical for the evolu- tion of long life spans and the emer- gence of a postreproductive phase

There are more con- vincing suggestions of provisioning of the sedentary disabled and elderly by the initial Late Pleistocene. Of note is the Shanidar I individual, who had severe injuries that had healed,137 perhaps indicating that some elderly individuals cared for juveniles and were provisioned by others who foraged

Cumulative Culture and Nonkin Cooperation:
Cumulative cultural capacity is indicated by traits that require multi- ple innovative steps and cannot feasi- bly be acquired through individual learning in a single generation.

cumulative cultural ability may have been present around the time that hominins occupied temperate latitudes.

Even during interglacials, biologi- cally subtropical humans would have needed fire and some kind of body coverings for survival, suggesting reliance on semi-complex socially transmitted innovations.

On the other hand, the monotony of Middle Pleistocene stone technology displays little cumulative cultural innovation for much of this period.

An east-west division recognized in Early and Middle Pleistocene lithic industries, with bifaces common across much of Africa, India, and Western Eurasia, but rare elsewhere,140 persisted for hundreds of millennia.

morphological differences among Middle Pleistocene bifaces seem more attributable to lithic raw mate- rial and artifact life histories than protocultural traditions.

Late Pleistocene:
different technological traditions had emerged across limited geographical space. 

Most importantly, if Cha- telperronian or some other post- Mousterian industry is a product of Neanderthals,125 this implies that the cognitive machinery required to pro- duce cumulative culture must have evolved before the human-Neanderthal split.

Ethnic signaling, indicating social norms and intergroup competition or segregation, is a ubiquitous feature of modern Homo sapiens, with group membership often signaled by personal adornment.

The earliest potential evidence of ethnic signaling may be ground ochre and manganese diox- ides found in sites from Europe, Africa, and India during the late Mid- dle Pleistocene,147,148 although these materials also

Cooperation between nonkin is probably indicated by large residential group size, and material sources transported over large distances. 

The transition to larger social groupings is clearly evident by OIS 3, including a shift toward central place foraging and increasingly distant resource for- ays among all hominins of western Eurasia at least

TEMPORAL SEQUENCE:
A. Bipedality led to manipulative dexterity, low-cost transport, and larger home range. These traits favored more extensive tool use and greater selection for social learning capacities.
Oldowan tools indicate abilities not present in other apes. Amplified home range was a critical preadapta- tion for the subsequent dietary shift to widely dispersed but nutrient- dense resources.

B. Dietary shift to a hunted and extracted diet created juvenile dependence on adult provisioning. This promoted kin-based cooperative breeding along with evolution of early prosocial emotions, enhanced theory of mind, shared intentionality, and more complex communication that facilitated task specialization and integration of the shared goals of cooperative breeders. The emergence of a home-base economic system allowed adults debilitated by illness and injury to recover, favoring later senescence and later sexual maturity.

C. Imitative capacity and shared intentionality interacted to produce cumulative cultural capacity. This relied on a pedagogical mode of interaction in which imitators presumed that models were motivated to help rather than compete with them.

high-fidelity social learning can only be strongly favored when there are already useful cultural traits to be copied. In order for cultural accumu- lation to take place, there must be a large population, frequent and close interaction between models and imi- tators, and long time periods to allow rare innovations to arise, spread, and stabilize without being lost through stochastic processes. 

D. Cumulative cultural capacity and prosocial emotions led to language, social norms, ethnicity, and extensive nonkin cooperation. 

This allowed the emergence of social norms regulating mate exchange between kin groups and promoted intergroup peaceful interaction due to cross-cutting genetic interests, as well as the emergence of gifting and trading.

Because of the increase in effective interacting group size, with members of multiple residential or social units becoming models for imitation, cultural accumulation sped up enormously.

Cultural group selection became an important force in human history. Increased coopera- tive proclivities and reliance on social learning continued to coevolve to produce a uniquely cultural and cooperative species.

The last Interglacial/Glacial cycle
was a critical period for the spread of uniquely human cultural components of cooperation. At the beginning of the Late Pleistocen},

abstract = {We investigated the role of somatosensory feedback from locomotor muscles on central motor drive (CMD) and the development of peripheral fatigue during high-intensity endurance exercise. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, eight cyclists randomly performed three 5 km time trials: control, interspinous ligament injection of saline (5K(Plac), L3-L4) or intrathecal fentanyl (5K(Fent), L3-L4) to impair cortical projection of opioid-mediated muscle afferents. Peripheral quadriceps fatigue was assessed via changes in force output pre- versus postexercise in response to supramaximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation (DeltaQ(tw)). The CMD during the time trials was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram (iEMG). Fentanyl had no effect on quadriceps strength. Impairment of neural feedback from the locomotor muscles increased iEMG during the first 2.5 km of 5K(Fent) versus 5K(Plac) by 12 +/- 3{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05); during the second 2.5 km, iEMG was similar between trials. Power output was also 6 +/- 2{\%} higher during the first and 11 +/- 2{\%} lower during the second 2.5 km of 5K(Fent) versus 5K(Plac) (both P {\textless} 0.05). Capillary blood lactate was higher (16.3 +/- 0.5 versus 12.6 +/- 1.0{\%}) and arterial haemoglobin O(2) saturation was lower (89 +/- 1 versus 94 +/- 1{\%}) during 5K(Fent) versus 5K(Plac). Exercise-induced DeltaQ(tw) was greater following 5K(Fent) versus 5K(Plac) (-46 +/- 2 versus -33 +/- 2{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Our results emphasize the critical role of somatosensory feedback from working muscles on the centrally mediated determination of CMD. Attenuated afferent feedback from exercising locomotor muscles results in an overshoot in CMD and power output normally chosen by the athlete, thereby causing a greater rate of accumulation of muscle metabolites and excessive development of peripheral muscle fatigue.},

abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Can physiological concentrations of metabolite combinations evoke sensations of fatigue and pain when injected into skeletal muscle? If so, what sensations are evoked? What is the main finding and its importance? Low concentrations of protons, lactate and ATP evoked sensations related to fatigue. Higher concentrations of these metabolites evoked pain. Single metabolites evoked no sensations. This suggests that the combination of an ASIC receptor and a purinergic P2X receptor is required for signalling fatigue and pain. The results also suggest that two types of sensory neurons encode metabolites; one detects low concentrations of metabolites and signals sensations of fatigue, whereas the other detects higher levels of metabolites and signals ache and hot. The perception of fatigue is common in many disease states; however, the mechanisms of sensory muscle fatigue are not understood. In mice, rats and cats, muscle afferents signal metabolite production in skeletal muscle using a complex of ASIC, P2X and TRPV1 receptors. Endogenous muscle agonists for these receptors are combinations of protons, lactate and ATP. Here we applied physiological concentrations of these agonists to muscle interstitium in human subjects to determine whether this combination could activate sensations and, if so, to determine how the subjects described these sensations. Ten volunteers received infusions (0.2 ml over 30 s) containing protons, lactate and ATP under the fascia of a thumb muscle, abductor pollicis brevis. Infusion of individual metabolites at maximal amounts evoked no fatigue or pain. Metabolite combinations found in resting muscles (pH 7.4 + 300 nm ATP + 1 mm lactate) also evoked no sensation. The infusion of a metabolite combination found in muscle during moderate endurance exercise (pH 7.3 + 400 nm ATP + 5 mm lactate) produced significant fatigue sensations. Infusion of a metabolite combination associated with vigorous exercise (pH 7.2 + 500 nm ATP + 10 mm lactate) produced stronger sensations of fatigue and some ache. Higher levels of metabolites (as found with ischaemic exercise) caused more ache but no additional fatigue sensation. Thus, in a dose-dependent manner, intramuscular infusion of combinations of protons, lactate and ATP leads to fatigue sensation and eventually pain, probably through activation of ASIC, P2X and TRPV1 receptors. This is the first demonstration in humans that metabolites normally produced by exercise act in combination to activate sensory neurons that signal sensations of fatigue and muscle pain.},

annote = {In these and other dilemmas, essential decisions are made not by individual social actors but by representatives such as officials from elected governments. Representatives have been shown to display a more competitive mindset than ‘ordinary' group members7. However, the behaviour of representatives in a social dilemma has, to our knowledge, not been investigated experimentally. To fill this gap is the aim of our paper.


The global emissions-reduction problem has been simulated experimentally in the ‘collective-risk social dilemma' game14–18. A number of volunteers can invest anonymously from their individual endowments into a climate account in each of 10 consecutive rounds. If the group collectively reaches a specified target sum, everybody receives in cash what she has not invested from her endowment. However, if the group fails to reach the target, individuals risk losing all their remaining endowment with a high probability, mimicking the drastic economic losses that result from dangerous climate change.

In game 3, the groups in the 18-players treatment are the least successful (Fig. 2a–c), but again differences are not statistically significant




We find that selfish players are preferentially elected and are
hence found more frequently in the six-representatives treatment than in the other two treatments.
Across all treatments, we identify the selfish players as extortioners.

We develop a mathematical model and confirm its prediction that the extortioners' steadfast strategies enforce cooperation from fair players who finally compensate almost completely the deficit caused by the extortionate co-players.

RESULTS:

Game1:
In the first game of the 18-players treatment and of the 6-representatives treatment, only 33{\%} of the groups reach the target sum. 

By contrast, groups in the six-players treatment are almost twice as likely to collect sufficient contributions in the first game, with 60{\%} of the groups reaching the target sum (Fig. 2a–c), similar to a previous study

The percentage of groups reaching the target sum increases towards game 3 in the six-players and the six-representatives treatment, but the increase is not statistically significant

The total sums contributed per group do not differ among treatments in games 2 and 3 (Fig. 2e,f). In game 1, the six representatives contribute less than the six players (P¼0.019, 

in game 1, representatives are randomly picked from the group (see methods), the only difference between the two treatments is that representatives are contributing on behalf of their observing group. 

In such situations, representatives may have a more competitive mindset, which would explain why groups in the six-representatives treatment reach the target less often.

All Games:
Summed up over all three games per group, contributions relative to the target
sum are lowest in the six-representatives treatment, significantly
lower than in the six-players treatment (P¼0.0061, z¼?2.742, n1¼n2¼15, Mann–Whitney U-test)

Players:
The percentage of selfish players is highest in the 6-representatives treatment (Fig. 3a), higher than in the 6-players treatment
(P¼0.01, z¼?2.559, n1¼n2¼15, Mann–Whitney U-test) and almost significantly higher than in the 18-players treatment
(P¼0.06, z¼?1.862, n1¼n2¼15, Mann–Whitney U-test)

The average contribution of a selfish player (relative to the fair-share contribution) is lower in the 18-players treatment
than in both the 6-players (P¼0.02, z¼?2.302, n1¼n2¼15, Mann–Whitney U-test; Fig. 3b) and the 6-representatives treatment

Over all three games, the net payoff (including trials where the group fails to collect the target sum and loses all remaining money) is higher for selfish than for fair players (Fig. 3c).

Selfish players achieve a higher net payoff in the 6-players treatment, compared with both the 18-players treatment (P¼0.024, z¼?2.261, n1¼n2¼15, Mann–Whitney U-test) and the 6-representatives treatment (P¼0.020, z¼?2.325, n1¼n2¼15, Mann–Whitney U-test, shown per represented player; Fig. 3c).

What are selfish players doing?
the selfish representatives might be
‘pessimistic conditional cooperators' who dislike that others contribute less than their fair share and thus stop contributing. However, all selfish representatives contribute more in the
end than in the beginning (P¼0.0002, linear regression of contribution per selfish representative per group on rounds 1–10, analysed for game 3) and resemble ‘imperfect conditional cooperators'

By increasing their contribution during the 10
rounds as do fair representatives (P¼0.002), the selfish players help reaching the target, though they contribute much less than fair representatives.

Voters:
After game 1, those representatives who are re-elected have contributed significantly less in game 1 than those who are voted out (Fig. 4a)
(P¼0.01, z¼?2.587, n¼15, Wilcoxon signed-rank matched pairs test).

While this is not the case after game 2, we still find a tendency that selfish representatives are preferentially re-elected, based on their past contributions.

In addition, before each election the players formulate election pledges specifying their contribution strategy if elected. 

The percentage of selfish pledges (see Methods) is higher among the 6 elected representatives than among all 18 players of that treatment (Fig. 4b), although
significantly so only after game 2 (P¼0.0071, z¼?2.692, n¼11, Wilcoxon signed-rank matched pairs test).

representatives who act selfishly in game 1 are preferentially re-elected, and players who pledge to be selfish are preferentially elected after game 2.


Hence, selfish players want selfish representatives, and fair players want fair representatives:
Players classified as selfish according to their election pledges
vote in 71.3{\%} for classified selfish players and in 10.1{\%} for classified fair representatives. Players classified as fair vote in 78.9{\%} for classified fair players and in 14.6{\%} for classified selfish players (the complement missing from 100{\%} is due to players that could not be classified as either selfish or fair)

Thus, players fulfil their pledges when acting
as representatives:
- Representatives who have pledged to be selfish contribute less in the following game than those who have pledged to be fair
(Fig. 4c; after game 1: P¼0.007, z¼?2.692, n¼10; after game 2: P¼0.0051, z¼?2.803, n¼10, Wilcoxon signed-rank matched pairs test).

Identification of selfish players as extortioners:
Theorists have predicted for a long time that cooperative and fair strategies such as Tit-for-Tat would eventually succeed in social dilemmas

Why then would subjects vote for representatives who mainly pursue the success of their own subgroup while disregarding the risks for the whole community?

We hypothesize that the election procedure would favour representatives who motivate the other subgroups' representatives to reach the target, but at the same time ensure that the own subgroup contributes less than other subgroups. Individuals

Individuals would like their representatives to be steadfast and to convince the other subgroups' representatives to compensate for any missing contributions.

Such behaviour is reminiscent of the recently discovered class of extortionate ZD strategies for the repeated prisoner's dilemma24–30, where extortionate players incentivize their opponents to cooperate although they themselves are not fully cooperative.

In pairwise encounters, these extortionate players cannot be beaten by any other strategy, and they are predicted to perform well among adaptive co-players

ii) Extortioners persuade their co-players to make up for the missing contributions; that is, the collective best response for the remaining N?1 group members is to choose x?i such that the group reaches the target sum T,


The contribution per fair
player increases over the three games (Fig 5a; P¼0.0057, F2,130¼5.3788, generalized linear model (GLM) with family¼Gaussian). 

By contrast, the contribution per selfish player does not increase significantly (P¼0.66, F2,131¼0.4163, GLM).

We find a significant interaction between fair and selfish
players' contributions over the three games (P¼0.032, F2,261¼3.4798, GLM). Over the three games, as the contributions

In each game, selfish players gain more than fair players; the difference increases from game 1 to game 3 (Fig. 5c) (P¼0.046, z¼?1.995, n¼45, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test)


The psychological consequences of acting as a representative of a
group have been characterised as evoking both more competitive interaction goals and more competitive expectations of others

A representative is faced with a powerful responsibility to provide good outcomes for her constituency and may face strong pressures by being monitored and evaluated},

@article{Hofstede1980,
abstract = {Over a period of 6 years, 40 independent nations were studied to determine empirically the main criteria by which their national cultures differed, with the following criteria being found: 1. Power Distance, 2. Uncertainty Avoidance, 3. Individualism-Collectivism, and 4. Masculinity-Femininity. Research data were obtained by comparing the beliefs and values of employees, within the subsidiaries of one large multinational corporation, in 40 countries. A comparison between Austrian and US culture has justified the popularity of expectancy theories of motivation in the US. The combination of the US of weak Uncertainty Avoidance, and relatively high Masculinity, indicates much about why the achievement motive has become so popular in that nation. However, it can be questioned as to whether there is a universal validity of management theories developed in one country, i.e., the US. The problem then, is whether to adapt to the local culture or attempt to change it. The training of managers for assignments abroad is an important area in which the cultural boundaries of home-country management theories play a role.},

Nevertheless, the nature of such interactions is poorly understood. How do representatives approach such interactions? What goals do they pursue, and what expectations do they have of their counterpart? In the present research, we advance a theoretical framework with which to understand the mindset that is activated by the role of representative. In two studies, we measure what goals (Study 1) and expectations (Study 2) become salient in this role, compared with the related roles of individual or group member. Our findings reveal that representatives may display a more competitive mindset, consisting of more competitive goals and expectations of others. As competition can be harmful, rather than beneficial to the group, care should be taken when relying on representatives, so that we may exploit their strengths while curtailing their weaknesses. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Creativity is a cornerstone of what makes us human, yet the neural mechanisms underlying creative thinking are poorly understood. A recent surge of interest into the neural underpinnings of creative behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but, considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory. We review the emerging literature and take stock of several long-standing theories and widely held beliefs about creativity. A total of 72 experiments, reported in 63 articles, make up the core of the review. They broadly fall into 3 categories: divergent thinking, artistic creativity, and insight. Electroencephalographic studies of divergent thinking yield highly variegated results. Neuroimaging studies of this paradigm also indicate no reliable changes above and beyond diffuse prefrontal activation. These findings call into question the usefulness of the divergent thinking construct in the search for the neural basis of creativity. A similarly inconclusive picture emerges for studies of artistic performance, except that this paradigm also often yields activation of motor and temporoparietal regions. Neuroelectric and imaging studies of insight are more consistent, reflecting changes in anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal areas. Taken together, creative thinking does not appear to critically depend on any single mental process or brain region, and it is not especially associated with right brains, defocused attention, low arousal, or alpha synchronization, as sometimes hypothesized. To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must be further subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully associated with specific neurocognitive processes.},

Besides taking a bottom-up approach to review the literature relevant to the self within a Chinese context, this article also identifies the recurring themes among the topics on the self by assessing the frequency of their appearance in the literature. Although there are many topics relevant to the study of self-processes, this article focuses on only a few.

abstract = {Quotations describing cooperation and competition among Chinese extracted from the first volume of The Handbook of Chinese Psychology can be compared with the contrasting quotations from recent studies illustrating that much has changed in the field of cooperation-competition research over the past decade. The complexities of culture and its effects on cooperation and competition have been revealed through more recent discoveries which confront previous stereotypical perceptions of the Chinese. Many of these findings help to enrich our understanding of whether and how Chinese cooperate or compete relative to Westerners. While most research is concerned with concepts derived from individualism and collectivism and focuses on investigating their links with cooperation and competition, we hope to take the analyses beyond this initial notion of differences in cultural values to further unpackage the variations found in cooperation and competition between the East and the West. In doing so, we will review findings on how various intra-individual and inter-individual variables underlie cultural differences in cooperative and competitive behaviors. We will look first at intra-individual variables, such as beliefs and values, risk preferences, regulatory focus, and conflict-management styles, and explain how these variables impact on competition and cooperation in different cultural contexts. We then explore the inter-individual variables related to cooperative conflicts, conversational style, power, fairness, interactional justice, and trust, and assess how these factors affect the two concepts from one nation to another. We will conclude by discussing multiple views on competition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Social Loafing: occurs in individualistic groups but not in collectivistic groups. 

Chinese students, when asked to perform moderately intellective tasks were found to perform better as a group, while the opposite pattern was observed among American students (Gabrenya, Latan{\'{e}}, {\&} Wang, 1983; Karau {\&} Williams, 1993).

Japanese students, who are considered to be highly collectivistic (Hofstede, 1991) also performed better when in groups than when alone (Matsui, Kakuyama, {\&} Onglatco, 1987)

the apparently consistent theme at that time was that Chinese (Domino, 1992) and Chinese-Americans (e.g. Cox, Lobel, {\&} McLeod, 1991) often behaved in a more cooperative manner than did Caucasians.

The underlying idea is that increased collectivism leads to more cooperation, while increased individualism leads to more competition.

Yamagishi (2003): the reason why Japanese preferred to belong to groups and to put a group's interest before their own is not because of their intrinsic tendencies but rather the existence of a system of formal and informal mutual monitoring and sanctioning. Once these sanctions are absent, such as in cases where interacting members are complete strangers, individuals' behaviors will no longer be constrained by their concerns for others, and as a result they will more likely reveal their egoistic sides and behave accordingly.

Social Axioms: social cynicism, social complexity, reward for application, religiosity, and fate control
significantly predict social performance across three classes of social behaviors: styles of conflict resolution, ways of coping, and vocational interests

They found that Chinese were indirect only when they were dealing with their superiors. When interacting with their peers, Chinese were no less indirect than Australians were. Chinese can indeed approach decision conflicts directly in order to reach true agreement},

abstract = {Relief from pain in humans is frequently measured by computing the reduction on an 11-point pain intensity scale. However, this definition of relief may be insufficient to capture the utility of pain relief for the individual. Based on pain literature and evidence from studies examining relief and reward, it is clear that pain relief is a broad concept comprising several factors, only one of which is pain intensity reduction. According to opponent process theory, all sensations consist of a primary process and a slow 'opponent process' of opposite valence, the purpose of which is to reduce the deviation from homeostatic balance. Here, opponent process theory provided a framework to explore the interaction between pain, relief and reward. We devised three psychophysical studies examining the temporal (Experiment I) and magnitude (Experiments I and II) relationships between pain severity and its subsequent relief. In Experiment III, we further manipulated the magnitude and pleasantness of relief experienced by applying innocuous cooling following noxious heat stimulation of capsaicin-sensitized skin. Results confirmed predictions from opponent process theory and showed that pain intensity reduction was significantly stronger than relief intensity ratings. Furthermore, continuous relief ratings appeared to reflect the speed of pain intensity reduction. Varying pain intensity parametrically confirmed that relief increases with pain intensity. That innocuous cooling following primary hyperalgesia intervention significantly increased the intensity, pleasantness and duration of relief provides further evidence that pain relief encapsulates more than a reduction in pain intensity. Importantly, the high relief pleasantness ratings confirmed the hypothesized link between relief and reward.},

abstract = {On the basis of a review of the extant literature describing emotion-cognition interactions, the authors propose 4 methodological desiderata for studying how task-irrelevant affect modulates cognition and present data from an experiment satisfying them. Consistent with accounts of the hemispheric asymmetries characterizing withdrawal-related negative affect and visuospatial working memory (WM) in prefrontal and parietal cortices, threat-induced anxiety selectively disrupted accuracy of spatial but not verbal WM performance. Furthermore, individual differences in physiological measures of anxiety statistically mediated the degree of disruption. A second experiment revealed that individuals characterized by high levels of behavioral inhibition exhibited more intense anxiety and relatively worse spatial WM performance in the absence of threat, solidifying the authors' inference that anxiety causally mediates disruption. These observations suggest a revision of extant models of how anxiety sculpts cognition and underscore the utility of the desiderata.},

abstract = {When well-learned motor skills fail, such as when elderly persons fall or when athletes "choke under pressure," it is assumed that attention is directed toward the execution of the action. Research findings suggest that this controlled execution and subsequent inferior performance depend on a dominant left-hemispheric activation. In a series of 3 experiments, we tested whether increasing right-hemispheric activation by the use of hemisphere-specific priming extenuates motor skill failure. We compared the performances of a sample of experienced athletes in different sports (soccer, tae kwon do, and badminton) in a pressure-free situation with that performed under pressure. As expected, the hemisphere-specific priming extenuated a performance decrease after pressure induction when compared with a control condition. The results suggest that hemisphere-specific priming may prevent motor skill failure. It is argued that this hemispheric priming should be task dependent and can be understood as a functional regulation of the activation in the hemispheres.},
annote = {Empirical evidence indicates that a performer's attention toward a movement execution—whether after a stroke or under pressure—is responsi- ble for the inferior performance, as it engenders conscious control of performance, which disrupts the automatic nature of the move- ment execution.

STROKE
Persons after a stroke and patients with Parkin- son's disease have been shown to have a higher propensity to consciously monitor their movements and to more readily “re- invest” (Masters, 1992) explicit knowledge about the movement compared with control (Masters, Pall, MacMahon, {\&} Eves, 2007; Orrell, Masters, {\&} Eves, 2009)

elderly persons showed more stable walking patterns when confronted with a simple cognitive task, diverting their focus of attention from movement execution (Huxhold, Li, Schmiedeck, {\&} Lindenberger, 2006; Verrel, Lovden, Schellenbach, Schaefer, {\&} Lindenberger, 2009)

SPORT
detrimental effects of consciously monitoring one's movement execu- tion comes from the examination of motor skills under psycholog- ical pressure (e.g., Baumeister, 1984; Beilock {\&} Carr, 2001; Liao {\&} Masters, 2002)

Baumeister (1984) first proposed that pressure increases conscious attention on the process of performance and that this in turn disrupts the automatic or over-learned nature of its execution.

More directly, Masters (1992) showed that participants who had ac- quired declarative knowledge about a task choked when they performed it under pressure, whereas participants who had learned the task implicitly did not choke.


The Acquisition of Motor Behavior and Its Breakdown
According to Fitts and Posner (1967), the acquisition of motor behavior passes through three phases:
1 cognitive, 
2 associative, and 
3 autonomous.

The cognitive phase involves cognitive (mostly ver- bal) representations of a motor action that help a performer de- velop a mental image of the action and provide a fuller under- standing of the required execution process.

associative phase, the performer physically practices the execution of the action learned in the cognitive phase and thus associates the cognitive representations with behavioral experiences.

autonomous phase, the performer learns to carry out the action with little conscious effort. A conscious verbal representation of the movement is usually no longer present

This finding was supported in an experimental study per- formed by Hossner and Ehrlenspiel (2010), who asked experienced basketball players to focus on verbally marked parts of a basketball free throw

Brain and Skilled Performance:
During the learning of a novel motor task, there is increased prefrontal activity (e.g., Doyon {\&} Ungerleider, 2002; Lacourse, Orr, Cramer, {\&} Cohen, 2005; van Mier, Tempel, Perlmutter, Raichle, {\&} Petersen, 1998), and it appears that especially left temporal regions, including language centers, are also involved (Deeny et al., 2003; Springer {\&} Deutsch, 1998).

With practice time, prefrontal activation decreases and control passes to the parietal cortex (van Mier et al., 1998) and the basal ganglia (Doyon, Penhune, {\&} Ungerleider, 2003; La- course et al., 2005; Penhune {\&} Doyon, 2002). The left hemisphere becomes less active (Landers et al., 1994), and visual-spatial processes located in the right hemisphere become more dominant (Salazar et al., 1990).

A large amount of research evidence suggests that frontotemoral areas of the left hemisphere are involved in initiating a skilled motor behavior, but these areas become inhibited (or sup- pressed) after starting the behavior.

Hatfield and colleagues (1984), for example, examined hemi- spheric activation among elite marksmen. As shooters prepared to fire a rifle, a shift occurred from predominantly left- to right- hemispheric activation. Similar hemispheric patterns have also been observed among elite archers (Salazar et al., 1990) and golfers (Crews {\&} Landers, 1993)

Left-hemispheric inhibition was stronger in experts than in lesser skilled individuals (Deeny et al., 2003; Haufler, Spalding, Santa Maria, {\&} Hatfield, 2000), which supports the notion of Fitts and Posner (1967) that individuals do not need to control the execution of a task consciously after it has become automated.

Moreover, a stronger left-hemispheric inhibition was associated with better performance (Crews, 2004; Kerick, Douglass, {\&} Hat- field, 2004; Landers et al., 1994).

In addition, activation in the right hemisphere has been associated with skilled performance (e.g., Hatfield et al., 1984; Hillman et al., 2000; Salazar et al., 1990). Activation in the right central, temporal, and parietal regions has been linked to visual-spatial processing (Sperry, 1973) and holistic organization of motor task execution (cf. Hellige, 1993; Hughdahl {\&} Davidson, 2003), which most motor activities depend on (Blaxton, 1996).

Rebert, Low, and Larsen (1984) found increased ac- tivity in the right hemisphere during the performance of complex visuomotor tasks (i.e., playing the video game Pong)

Directing attention toward one's own motion has been associated with the acti- vation of Broca's region (Binkofski et al., 2000), which is involved in language production (Hellige, 1993; Liberman, 1996)


Squeezing a soft ball with the left hand prior to the execution of a skilled motor task should thus enhance right-hemispheric activation, thereby helping the visu- ospatial processes needed for successful performance to dominate.


Experiment 1: Penalty Kicks

Their performance was measured by scoring each shot on a 6-point scale: 6 for a clean shot in, 5 for rim-and-in, 4 for rim-and-out, 3 for a shot in the surrounding wall element, 2 for a shot in the goal wall (other than in the surrounding wall element), and 1 for a complete miss. A similar scale was used by Hardy and Parfitt (1991) to assess the quality of basketball shots. Instruments.

to measure the participants' level of perceived pressure,
we recorded competitive state anxiety using the Wettkampfangst- Inventar-State (WAI-S; Ehrlenspiel, Brand, {\&} Graf, 2009). The WAI-S is the only published German instrument based on the multidimensional model of competitive state anxiety by Martens (Martens, Vealey, {\&} Burton, 1990).
Similar to the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, {\&} Smith, 1990)
We used only the somatic and the cognitive sub- scales for the analyses because they represent the central aspects of anxiety.

People differ in their vulnerability to motor skill failure according to their levels of trait anxiety (Wang, Marchant, Morris, {\&} Gibbs, 2004) and self-consciousness (Baumeister, 1984), or their tendency to turn their attention inward (Masters, Polman, {\&} Hammond, 1993). Individuals with higher trait anxiety and persons low in self-consciousness appear to be more vulnerable. Hence, those individuals may especially benefit from the use of hemisphere-specific priming},

Explanations of this phenomenon, e.g., the hypotheses of constrained action (Wulf et al., 2001) or of step-by-step execution (Masters, 1992; Beilock et al., 2002), however, do not refer to the level of underlying mechanisms on the level of sensorimotor control. For this purpose, a "nodal-point hypothesis" is presented here with the core assumption that skilled motor behavior is internally based on sensorimotor chains of nodal points, that attending to intermediate nodal points leads to a muscular re-freezing of the motor system at exactly and exclusively these points in time, and that this re-freezing is accompanied by the disruption of compensatory processes, resulting in an overall decrease of motor performance. Two experiments, on lever sequencing and basketball free throws, respectively, are reported that successfully tested these time-referenced predictions, i.e., showing that muscular activity is selectively increased and compensatory variability selectively decreased at movement-related nodal points if these points are in the focus of attention.},

This research deals with managerial conflict management in Denmark, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium. According to Hofstede (1991), these countries' cultures differ primarily in terms of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity-femininity. The differences in uncertainty avoidance suggest the hypothesis that Danish managers should prefer constructive ways of conflict management much more than Belgian managers, and–as a consequence of power distance differences–in particular in the case of conflict with superiors. The other three countries in our sample were predicted to take intermediate positions. An alternative prediction was that managers from highly feminine nations, such as Denmark and The Netherlands would show more constructive behaviour in conflict with colleagues than managers from more masculine nations. A questionnaire study among middle-managers from one large multinational firm with plants in these various countries confirmed the power distance, and the femininitymasculinity prediction. The results of this study did not support the prediction that cultural differences in terms of uncertainty avoidance influence managers' preferences for conflict management.},

annote = {There also is a great diversity in human groups, ranging from families, clans, local communities, work and interest groups, hobby and religious groups, nations, and network communities.

Groups are crucial “tools” for human adaptation
(Evoluitonary psychology is looking for evidence of these adaptations in causal mechanisms)

variations across societies in how individuals relate to groups

Hofstede (1980) first empirically examined how different societies across the world distribute on this cultural dimension.

People in individualistic cultures inter-group oriented, who identify themselves with the ingroup as an abstract social category, and look at the ingroup as a monolithic social category comprised of members who share similar attbitues in the comparative contest with outgroups

People in collectivistic cultures are intra-group oriented, who perceive the self to be connected with other ingroup members via relational ties, and the ingroup to be a bounded network of such ties

The core theme of individualism is the conception of individuals as autonomous beings who are separate from groups, while the central theme of collectivism is the conception of individuals as parts of groups or collectives

Individuals in individualistic cultures are expected to show less ingroup loyalty, giving priority to personal goals over the goals of collectives. In contrast, individuals in collectivistic cultures either make no distinction between personal and collective goals, or if they do so, they subordinate their personal goals to collective goals (Triandis, 1995)

The Challenge:
people in so-called “individualisic cultures” are actually highly group-oriented. A groundbreaking meta-analytic paper by Oyserman, Coon, and Kemmelmeier (2002) has revealed that North Americans, while being confirmed to be more individualistic than people in almost any other parts of the world, are simultaneously very high on the collectivism dimension.

North American level of collectivism was higher than Japanese, did not differ significantly from Koreans, and was sometimes higher than Chinese, depending on the scale content used in the studies (see also Takano {\&} Osaka, 1999)


Yuki's (Sensible) Theory:
There is, nonetheless, another possibility which was generally overlooked. Namely, while groups are universally important for all human beings, the type of psychological and behavioral processes that operate in group contexts may vary between cultures. In other words, there can be multiple kinds of group-orientation, in which group identification and behaviors might differ qualitatively rather than quantitatively between cultures.

Social Identity Theory and group process in individualistic cultures
Social identity theory, along with self-categorization theory, has been accepted in Western social psychology as the single comprehensive theory of psychological underpinnings of an array of intergroup and group phenomena (Tajfel {\&} Turner, 1986; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, {\&} Wetherell, 1987).

Depersonalization of self-representation
When social identity is made salient, individuals "come to perceive themselves more as the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their individual differences from others" (Turner, et al., 1987, p.50).

This form of depersonalization occurs in a comparative context between the ingroup and outgroup. That is, a categorization of the self as a group member is more likely to occur when the perceived differences between the self and other ingroup members are smaller than the differences between ingroup and outgroup members.




there has been virtually no empirical support for the widely-held
expectation that people in collectivistic cultures will be more ingroup-serving than people in individualistic cultures. Evidence rather suggests that discrimination against outgroups is actually more pronounced in individualistic cultures. We will discuss cross-cultural differences in intergroup discrimination more in detail later.


Self-concept: Relational rather than collective

Brewer and Gardner (1996) between the collective and the relational selves (see also E. S. Kashima {\&} Hardie, 2000; Y. Kashima et al., 1995). The collective self is the self defined in terms of prototypical properties that are shared among depersonalized members of a common ingroup (Brewer, 1991). The relational self, on the other hand, is the self defined in terms of connections and role relationships with significant others (Cross {\&} Madson, 1997; Gilligan, 1982; Markus {\&} Kitayama, 1991; McGuire {\&} McGuire, 1982).

These authors state that Asian cultures "are organized according to meanings and practices that promote the fundamental connectedness among individuals within a significant relationship (e.g., family, workplace, and classroom)"and that "the self is made meaningful primarily in reference to those social relations of which the self is a participating part" (Kitayama, Markus, Matsumoto, {\&} Norasakkunkit, 1997, p.1247).

Although this idea is often misunderstood, maintaining an "interdependent" self is
not only different from the self-representation at the category level (Turner, et al., 1987), but also from the phenomenon known as “self-extension,” to include significant others as part of the self (Aron, Aron, {\&} Smollan, 1992)

In the words of Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, and Nisbett (1998), "[L]iving interdependently does not mean the loss of self, the fusion of self with other, or the absence of self-interests. What it does mean is that attention, cognition, affect, and motivation are organized with respect to relationship and norms" (p. 925).

Although the self among people in collectivistic cultures are embedded in social relations, they are attributed with "the capacity to do right or wrong, and, ultimately, the individual alone is responsible for what he is" (King {\&} Bond, 1985, p.31).


Ingroup representation: Bounded network rather than homogenous entity
The prevalence of the relational self, rather than collective self, among people in collectivistic cultures does not imply that they downplay the ingroup as a meaningful social unit. In fact, they do impose boundaries between ingroups and outgroups (Gudykunst, 1988; Smith {\&} Bond, 1999). The critical difference, nonetheless, is that those in collectivistic cultures do not depict individuals' perceptions of their ingroups as depersonalized entities, as social identity theory would predict, but as complex networks of interrelated individual members (Choi, et al., 1993; Hamaguchi, 1977; Ho, 1993; U. Kim {\&} Lee, 1994; Lebra, 1976; Nakane, 1970).

This relational view of groups was evident even in the teachings of Confucius, who conceptualized a family as a network consisting of three of the "Five Cardinal Relations": between father and son, elder brother and younger brother, and husband and wife.

Confucius considered the ideal society as a "massive and complicated role system" (King {\&} Bond, 1985, p.30). Even today, people often use the metaphor of a family when they speak of other kinds of groups, in which vertical and horizontal roles are clearly differentiated (Chang, Lee, {\&} Koh, 1996; Nakane, 1970).

The East Asian way of perceiving the ingroup as a network can be described in more theoretical terms, congruent with an alternative form of perceived group entitativity:

entitativity was coined by Donald Campbell (1958) to denote the degree to which a social collective is viewed as a single unit or entity

Among factors that determine entitativity, perceived similarity or homogeneity has attracted the greatest attention in subsequent research (e.g., Brewer {\&} Harasty, 1996; McGarty, Haslam, Hutchinson, {\&} Grace, 1995). 

However, later theorization also focused on organization and structure, or dynamic properties, as alternative bases for entitativity, such as a hierarchical structure within the group, as a differentiation of roles and functions among the members, as a purposive integration of activity, and/or as clear differences in leadership, power, status, and responsibility (Hamilton, Sherman, {\&} Lickel, 1998; Lickel, Hamilton, {\&} Sherman, 2001)

What can be predicted from the current arguemnt is that the predominant basis of group entitativity may differ between individualistic and collectivistic cultures.

In line with this, Kurebayashi, Hoffman, Ryan, and Murayama's (2012) cross-cultural study showed that trait similarity among group members predicted entitavitiy among Americans, whereas for Japanese shared goals and dynamic properties was more strongly associated with entitavitity (see Haslam, Holland {\&} Karasawa, this volume, for a more detailed review of culture and group entitativity,).

The contrast between the depersonalized and the network view of ingroups is also
consistent with the distinction between common-identity and common-bond groups (Prentice, Miller, {\&} Lightdale, 1994)

The common-identity group is similar to social identity theory's view of ingroups as undifferentiated and depersonalized, whereas the common-bond group may be consistent with the view of ingroups by people in collectivistic cultures as composed of cognitively differentiated members.

intergroup comparison focus in individualistic cultures, and intragroup relationship orientation in collectivistic cultures --

In general, participants from collectivist cultures generate more references to social relationships and role identities in their spontaneous self-descriptions, but respondents in individualistic cultures are equal or greater in their references to social group or social category memberships

In a particularly comprehensive cross-cultural test, Watkins et al. (1998) obtained responses from a large number of university students from four different individualistic cultures (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Whites in South Africa) and five collectivist cultures (China, Ethiopia, Philippines, Turkey, and Blacks in South Africa). They classified self-descriptions obtained with the Twenty Statements Test (Kuhn {\&} McPartland, 1954) into four categories: idiocentric (e.g., personal qualities, traits, attitudes), allocentric (relational constructs such as sociable, good friend, etc.), small group memberships (e.g., family relationships), and large group memberships (e.g., I am a student, I am Chinese, etc.).

while members of individualistic cultures and of collectivist cultures generated approximately the same proportion of idiocentric self-descriptions, the two groups differed in the type of social reference that appeared most frequently. Respondents from collectivistic countries tend to generate greater number of self-descriptions pertaining to allocentric or small group memberships, whereas those from individualistic countries generated more references to large group memberships.

Kashima, Hardie, Wakimoto, and Kashima (2011) tested the influence of social
contexts that make social identities salient. They primed Australians and Asians in Australia with four contextual primes: individual, relational, collective, and control (nonsocial). The results showed that the relational context gave rise to increased social self-descriptions (relational and collective jointly) among Asians, whereas the collective context increased it among Australians.



Takemura, Yuki, and Ohtsubo (2010) compared spontaneous attention to intergroup
status differences and intragroup relationships between Americans and Japanese: Every scenario included several pieces of information regarding status differences between the three groups (intergroup comparison information), as well as relationships between three ingroup members and their cooperativeness (intragroup relationship information).

After a few filler questions, participants were asked to complete a surprise memory test. For each scenario, participants were asked to indicate whether information presented, either pertaining to intragroup relationship and intergroup comparisons, accurately described what had been written in the scenarios they had read previously. The results showed, as predicted, that compared to Japanese participants, memory performance among U.S. participants was biased toward intergroup status difference information over intragroup relationship information. Americans, who are more likely to hold a collective and depersonalized conceptualization of the self within the ingroup context, are more receptive to information pertaining to status differences between groups than are Japanese, whose relational social identity is more focused on the connections of distinct individuals within the group.

Intragroup behaviors

Buchan et al. (2002) found that, in an investment game involving indirect exchange situation, participants with individualistic cultural orientations increased their levels of trust in unknown others (in terms of amount of monetary investment) when shared identity of an arbitrary social category with the target person was made salient. Participants with a collectivist orientation, on the contrary, did not alter the level of trust whether or not a category identity was salient.

Buchan, Croson, and Johnson (2006) compared trust behaviors between American and Chinese participants. They found that U.S. participants showed a clear ingroup bias in trust, whereas Chinese did not show such a tendency.

Yamagishi et al. (2005) found that sharing of group membership (e.g., same country, same university) was sufficient to generate higher trust in ingroup members for Australians, but not for Japanese

These counterintuitive findings regarding the relationship between collectivist
cultural values and group-based trust can be understood if one recognizes that there are two distinct bases for the trust for a stranger in the ingroup. The first is a shared social category, which gives a basis for a depersonalized trust (Brewer, 1981)

When a shared social categorization is made salient and cognitive representations of fellow ingroup members and that of the self becomes overlapping, individuals, in line with social identity theory, are more likely to trust ingroup members to allocate resources fairly than selfishly (Foddy, et al., 2009), to conserve resources for the sake of ingroup (Brewer {\&} Kramer, 1986), and to contribute more to the public good without knowing whether other ingroup members are also contributing their shares (Wit {\&} Kerr, 2002)

In the second basis for trust, individuals can trust others when they (believe that they) are directly or indirectly connected to each other through interpersonal ties (Coleman, 1990). A shared network of interpersonal relationships provides a mechanism for extending personalized trust to unknown others who are part of the social network.

Yuki et al. 2005 study on trust


Intergroup discrimination

In fact, results from a number of comparative studies seem to be in line with the idea that collectivist values are associated with a greater ingroup-outgroup differentiation. For instance, an experiment on the effects of cultural cues on social behavior showed that a priming with Chinese (vs. American or culture-neutral) symbols made college students from Hong Kong (who are expected to be biculturals) to be more cooperative in the Prisoner's Dilemma game with their friends.

However, the priming did not affect these biculturals' cooperative choices when they played the game with strangers (Wong {\&} Hong, 2005). In other words, Chinese symbols, as compared to American symbols, lead to greater ingroup bias in cooperation.

Second, a study on communication showed that Korean and Japanese students tend to think that communication with classmates is more intimate, smooth, and less difficult than communication with strangers. These differences were not found among American participants (Gudykunst, Yoon, {\&} Nishida, 1987). 

Third, studies on distributive justice have shown that people from collectivist cultures tend to support the use of different reward allocation norms to ingroup (equality) and outgroup (equity). Such differenticals are less evident among American participants (Leung {\&} Bond, 1984; Mahler, Greenberg, {\&} Hayashi, 1981). 

Finally, a comparative study on conflict resolution showed that culture and target interactively affect how individuals deal with interpersonal disputes. Hong Kong Chinese college students were, in comparison with their Aemrican counterparts, less likely to pursue a conflict with an ingroup disputant (close friend) but more likely to pursue a conflict with an outgroup disputant (stranger) (Leung, 1988).

It must be noted, nonetheless, that any of these findings do not indicate that people in collectivistic cultures are motivated toward maximizing ingroup-outgroup differences (as predicted by social identity theory), but simply that they relate differently to ingroups and outgroups.

That is, the source of intergroup discrimination and distinction among people in collectivistic cultures will not be based on the orientation toward active comparison and differentiation between groups, as social identity theory depicts, but instead will be a necessary consequence of their motivation for the maintenance of harmonious and reciprocal relationships within the ingroup.
[i.e. China being challenged by the States?]


Evidence: First, research indicates that evaluative ingroup bias is greater in individualistic than in collectivistic cultures, particularly when the targets of evaluation are category-based ingroups and outgroups



Bond and Hewstone (1988) found that Chinese students in Hong Kong had less positive images of the ingroup than did British students. Heine and Lehman (1997) found that Japanese students rated their own universities less positively than did students from rival universities; this pattern was not found among Canadian students. Snibbe, Kitayama, Markus, and Suzuki (2003) found significantly less ingroup favoritism among Japanese football fans compared with their American counterparts, athough the two groups did not differ in the magnitude of ingroup identification. Finally, Rose (1985) found that Americans had more positive views of their country than did Japanese.


Conversely, research indicates that not only people in individualistic cultures but also in collectivistic cultures engage in evaluative ingroup bias when the groups are defined in terms of relational connections (Endo, Heine, {\&} Lehman, 2000). Even their self-critical attitudes have been interpreted as a strategy to to maintain harmonioius relationships with others (Heine {\&} Lehman, 1997; Kitayama, et al., 1997).

Behaviour in minimal groups:

In the literature on social identity theory, intergroup discrimination in allocation of rewards has been well documented in experimental research using the minimal intergroup paradigm (Brewer, 1979; Diehl, 1990; Tajfel, 1970; Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, {\&} Flament, 1971)

ingroups are defined as genuinely categorical, in the sense that they are determined based on arbitrary bases, such as by lottery, dot estimation tendency (overestimator vs. underestimator), and artistic preference, and, more importantly, there is no substantial interdependence among members

Wetherell (1982) found that the magnitude of ingroup bias in the minimal group paradigm was smaller among children with Polynesian compared to European cultural background; Polynesian children rather attempted to benefit both ingroup and outgroup members.

A series of studies by Yamagishi and colleagues with Japanese participants (Jin, Yamagishi, {\&} Kiyonari, 1996; Karp, Jin, Yamagishi, {\&} Shinotsuka, 1993) indicates that presence or absence of a structure of interdependence among ingroup members greatly affects whether participants engaged in ingroup bias.

Structure of interdependence necessary to elicit ingroup bias

it seems fair to conclude that the motivational basis for intergroup discrimination differs between cultures: creating maximum positive intergroup distinctiveness in the culture of individualism, whereas maintaining reciprocal intragroup relationships in the culture of collectivism.

Individualism and Intergroup Comparison: A Socio-Ecological Account

Evidence reviewed thus far supports the claim by Yuki and colleagues (Brewer {\&} Yuki, 2007; Yuki, 2003, 2011) that there are cross-cultural differences in the kinds, but not the levels, of predominant group orientations.

in so-called individualist societies such as North America, people are oriented toward intergroup comparison; they tend to define social groups in terms of shared features among group members, to have a depersonalized view of the self as a prototypical exemplar of the ingroup, and to be motivated to achieve higher intergroup status.

On the other hand, in societies which have been traditionaly viewed as collectivistic such as East Asia, individuals are oriented toward

American and Japanese college students completed questionnaires that assessed perceptions of essence properties (e.g., similarities in group members' physical and personality traits), dynamic properties (e.g., common goals and outcomes), entitativity, and autonomy for nine target groups. Multilevel analyses indicated that essence and dynamic properties predicted entitativity among both Americans and Japanese. However, between-person effects indicated that essence properties more strongly predicted entitativity in the United States than in Japan, whereas within-person effects indicated that dynamic properties more strongly predicted entitativity in Japan. Finally, dynamic properties and entitativity were independently associated with group autonomy and their effects were stronger when essence properties were high. However, as expected, these autonomy relationships were only evident in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Now, a new generation of researchers is embracing cultural and environmental variation to test evolutionary hypotheses. Here we discuss how comparative research with diverse societies, while challenging, can help inform the complex nature of our species' psychology and in doing so, we outline best theoretical and methodological practices as well as common pitfalls in cross-cultural investigations. We end with a recommendation for the use of publicly available databases for cataloging psychological variation across the world's many diverse populations. Because of rapid culture change and globalization, it is more important now than ever to document what we know about the world's cultures in ways that can be used by future researchers.},
annote = {Recognizing that humans are uniquely endowed with a suite of cognitive and developmental capacities for social and cultural transmission — capacities that have led to diverse, and often adaptive, phenotypes [24]

A new wave of evolutionary research concerns itself with identifying evolved psychological mechanisms that respond plastically to environmental conditions.

From an evolutionary perspective, true universality of a trait is expected only under certain conditions. Even traits closely tied to fitness are frequently observed to exhibit variation [29]

developmental plasticity is consistent with, and often predicted by, an evolutionary perspective.

What matters for a proper cross-cultural EP is not strict universality per se, but rather, a fit between theory and predictions for the trait in question, across the range of human environmental and cultural conditions.

‘Human nature' does not imply strict pheno- typic uniformity but rather a shared set of evolved de- velopmental resources, which are responsible for building psychological phenotypes that may vary depending on the local developmental environment [30].

Hypothesis testing:
hypothesis testing commonly proceeds by studying the relationship between the trait in question and the environment in which it evolved (for discussion [31]).

Critics, however, claim that the entire enterprise is flawed because the relevant environments, or environ- ments of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA), no longer exist.

Second, evolutionary psychologists recognize that EEAs are trait-specific, with different ecological histories and selection pressures for distinctive aspects of the phenotype [30].

For example, the EEA for mecha- nisms of color vision is different, both in temporal scope and relevant ecological problems, from the EEA for mechanisms of human cooperation.

hypotheses, including both hypotheses about universals and hypotheses about variation.

when, and under what conditions, a trait evolved, and whether its expression is hypothesized to be flexible

Instead, attention should be directed to identifying hypothesis-relevant dimensions of variability across cultures.

Generating and testing evolutionary hypotheses
evolutionary history, provides an important baseline for the patterns of variation we might expect.

phylogenetic patterns of descent with mod- ification provide information about the nature of ancestral traits from which human-specific traits evolved.

For example: the distribution of sex differences in body size, morphology, and behavior across primates provide a base- line for expectations about human sex differences and how they might vary across cultures as a function of environmental factors.

selection, traffics in the logic of adaptive design, including constraints, tradeoffs, and cost–benefit calculations.

Here, modeling of the kind employed in population genetics and evolutionary game theory is of particular importance. Predicting when and how traits will vary across cultures is not easy, because evolutionary predictions depend on the underlying de- sign tradeoffs — complex interactions between costs, benefits, and constraints — which we almost never know with certainty.},

there is a pervasive but shallow engagement with Confucianism in Chinese psychology capable of simultaneously benefitting locals and enhanc- ing global understanding

Nor does it provide roots for an indigenous Chinese psychology

Confucianism created an orthodoxy based on a conception of the high culture of a distant, semi-mythical past rather than on contempo- rary rulers or salient ethnicities. This helped makeChina's historical unity a cultural unity rather than one based on contemporary ethno-nationalism

This became part of the ruling orthodoxy of im- perial China, and was a central element to the endurance of Chinese culture despite long periods of weak/divided states. But such an orthodox Chinese high culture passed away with the Chinese imperial dynasties. Contemporary China isCommunist andforward-looking, embracing sci- ence and some market-based features ofWestern moder- nity. The state uses the past (e.g., aggrievedwar memories against Japan; see Liu {\&} Atsumi, 2008) more in line with contemporary forms of nationalism than in accord with imperial traditions.

There has been a rupture (Onar, Liu, {\&} Woodward, 2014) with the past, where the politicised Confucianism that once managed the bureaucracy and ideology of the imperial state is now dead. Confucian- ism itself, however, is a living tradition, and it does not have to adhere to elements of its past that are no longer psychologically active today.

Confucianism is a morally and socially conscious tradition that is focused on this-worldly concerns and conduct.

Confucian ethics are relational, reciprocal, and hierarchical, not supernatural.

What Confucius committed to was an ultimate concern to settle one's body and soul in this life. As he said, ‘It is man who can make theWay great, not the Way that can make man great'. (S.H. Liu, 1998,p.12)

The highest ideal of a man is ... ‘the way of inward sageliness and outward kingliness'. (S.H. Liu, 1998, p.

Cultivating human-heartedness is essential for good governance by any politician, ruler, or political class, but in reality many of them cultivate just the opposite, while maintaining appearances. 

Confucian forms of political statecraft focusing on the importance of setting a good moral and ethical example are always vulnerable to Machiavellian capture.

How this may be applied to the problem of corruption in contemporary China has massive potential implications and applications, as a for- mal system of checks and balances administered by law seems difficult for the one-party politics of Communism to implement

I summarise Quah's (2001) lessons from Singa- pore as incorporating a blend ofConfucianist and Legalist strategies from Chinese history: (1) political leadership must demonstrate exemplary conduct and punish ‘big fish', not just ‘little fish' who are corrupt, while increas- ing salaries and reducing opportunities for corruption for government officials (Confucianist); and (2) an overall anti-corruption strategy must be adopted consisting of comprehensive anti-corruption laws and an autonomous anti-corruption agency that is incorruptible and outside police jurisdiction (Legalist).

‘school learning environments in most Chinese societies, which have an overemphasis on assessment and teacher- centered instruction together with their typically large class sizes, do not conform to Western models of good practice,nevertheless, many Chinese students achieveout- standing results'

‘teachers in China and Hong Kong believe they have the role of cultivating not only their stu- dents' cognitive development, but also promoting positive attitudes tosocietyandresponsiblemoralbehavior'(Kem- ber {\&} Watkins, 2010, p. 177). They do this implicitly, by cultivating personal relationshipswith their students, and in alliance with parents, internalising a thirst for learning 

Students, in turn, do not simply learn by rote, as implied in Western theory about surface versus deep approaches to learning, but rather develop hrough a sequence of learning through stages, from reproduction to heightened levels of understanding through attentive effort.

‘Educational achievement is often emphasized as a social obligation, especially obligation to parents and fam- ily . . . learning [is] a means for self-cultivation and self- perfection' (p. 190, Hau {\&} Ho, 2010).

Blurring the line between intrinsic (good) and extrinsic (bad) motivation, research findings strongly suggest that behind Chinese students' high academic performance is their willingness to exert effort on tasks of even low interest or under ex- ternal pressure, a focus that has been attributed to their greater sense of responsibility and value attached to learning' (Hau {\&} Ho, 2010, p. 192)

‘the real foun- dation of ritual performances lies deep in the self rather than in the outside world . . . there is a profound depth dimension in man, and it is only through the realization of this depth dimension that he is able to develop into a full man' (S.H. Liu, 1998, p. 24).

The character of the ruler is like wind and that of the people is like grass. In whatever direction the wind blows, the grass bends' (S.H. Liu, 1998, p. 27).

In short, it is the dynamics among the elements, rather than the elements themselves, that serve as the primary units of analysis in the eyes of holistic thinkers. (Ji, Lee, {\&} Guo, 2010, p. 156)

Its socialization as part of the political culture of Taiwan was examined among high school adolescents aged 13–16. Significant gender differences were found inconsistent with traditional patriarchy. Regression analyses showed that within the relationship with mothers but not fathers, adolescents associated higher reciprocal filial piety, authoritative parenting, and authentic (positive) affect with higher BAB.

annote = {in-group identification and fusion with the group will affect collective efficacy (CE)

Multiple-mediation analyses showed that 

- shared flow and perceived emotional synchrony mediate the relationship between in-group identification and CE, 

- the relationship between identity fusion and CE was only mediated by perceived emotional synchrony

Collective efficacy represents one of the most studied psychosocial constructs given its implications for performance (Myers et al., 2004), and was initially defined as “the shared perception of a group of its efficacy to perform a behavior and to organize and execute the actions required to reach certain levels of achievement” (Bandura, 1997, p. 447;Mart{\'{i}}nez et al., 2011)

In-Group Identification and Identity Fusion
the benefits occurring within a group when co-members become part of the collective ego:

the extent to which individuals identifywith a groupmay influence their social perception (Ashmore et al., 2004; van Bavel and Cunningham, 2012),
involving an individual cognitive change of all members who are part of that group or collectivity.

a series of experimental studies and interviews have shown how shared in-groupmembershipmay enable intra-group trust,more cooperation and comfort in close physical proximity, and a decrease in stress (Drury et al., 2009; Novelli et al., 2010)

Leach et al. (2008) integrate the classic and contemporary thinking and have proposed an in-group identification construct that identifies five inter-correlated components: individual self-stereotyping, in-group homogeneity, satisfaction, solidarity, and centrality

FUSION: porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that the personal and social self will combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; Swann et al., 2012)

For instance, the members of a group who declare feeling part of a collective identity feel more identified with the group and have a higher performance than the individuals who report not experiencing high levels of fusion with the group (Swann et al., 2004; G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011) {\textless}--- This is incorrect!


Identity fusion occurs when social identity becomes an essential component of our personal self-concept (Swann et al., 2012)

individuals identified with the group share certain prototypical features with other group members that are not essential to their individual personal identities

Shared Flow and Perceived Emotional
Synchrony as Mediating Variables 
the relationship and emotional transformations that take place within groups.

Perceived Emotional Synchrony

Emotional contagion:
- positive emotional contagion among group members improves cooperation and increased perceived task performance (Barsade, 2002).
- Lumsden et al. (2014) reported that interpersonal synchrony compared to asynchronous movements elicited in participants more self-esteem, feelings of social connection, and self-other overlap with their partner.

According to Kessler and Hollbach (2005) group emotions take place in collective situationswhere the experienced identities result frombeing part of a group

Collective Effervescence:
The effervescence that develops in a collective gathering can be described as a multifaceted process of social synchronization: participants converge together in special spaces and at particular times; their attention and concentration are focused on the same thing—the core of the social event.

Participants display group mimesis or coordinated collective behaviors (shared gestures, sharedmovements,moving and marching together), thus enacting behavioral synchrony

voice and body becomes attuned to the shared emotional state in the group. These preceding elements concur in stimulating participants' emotional arousal in such a way that they will experience and enact similar emotional states. 

Due to the ease with which emotions are mirrored, shared and spread among people who are co-present, a situation of emotional synchrony develops, thus entailing emotions and perceptions of similarity and unity

What is essential is that individuals are gathered together, that common feelings are felt and that they are expressed in common acts. Group members need to be in communion, to be united in the same mind and in the same action (P{\'{a}}ez et al., 2015).

Flow: 
a deeply rewarding and optimal experience characterized by an intense focus on a certain activity to the point of being totally absorbed by it and the exclusion of all other thoughts and emotions.

Different studies on various sports showed that athletes who experienced flow while practicing sports tended to enjoy more, derive more satisfaction, and display more concentration and control over their performance (Cs{\'{i}}kszentmih{\'{a}}lyi, 1990; Jackson and Cs{\'{i}}kszentmih{\'{a}}lyi, 2002; Moradi et al., 2014)

.Cs{\'{i}}kszentmih{\'{a}}lyi (1990) considered collective gatherings or rituals as “affordances that a society offers to its members in order to allow them to meet optimal experiences under socially desirable forms” (p. 432).

In the same line, in Walker's study (2010) athletes revealed that collective flow was more intense and rewarding than individual flow, allowing them experience more enjoyment during sports.

Schiepe-Tiska and Engerser (2011)interviewed athletes and concluded that synchronized movements and a shared focus on attentiveness among peers were essential elements to experience flow in the competition.

Current experimental studies have found significantly greater group cooperation when synchrony and shared intentionality were combined (Reddish et al., 2013).


Hypotheses:
(H1) In-group identification and identity fusion will have direct effects on collective efficacy; 
(H2) Shared flow will mediate the relation between in-group identification and collective efficacy (H2a), and
between identity fusion with the group and collective efficacy (H2b); 
(H3) Perceived emotional synchrony willmediate the relationship between in-group identification and collective efficacy (H3a), 
and between identity fusion and collective efficacy (H3b).


Measures:
The In-Group Identification Scale It was developed by Leach et al. (2008).

Verbal Fusion Scale:

Shared Flow Scale:
Jackson and Marsh's Dispositional Flow Scale (1996) and its adaptation by Garc{\'{i}}a et al. (2008).

It has been reformulated by Zumeta et al. (2013) to explore the optimal shared group experiences (e.g., “We knew that our capabilities would enable us to face the challenge posed to us”; “We were totally focused on what we were doing”). 

The scale comprises 27 items distributed in nine dimensions: (1) Balance between challenge and skill; (2) Action-awareness merging; (3) Clear proximal goals; (4) Unambiguous and direct feedback; (5) Focused concentration on the current activity; (6) Sense of control over ones actions; (7) Loss of self-consciousness; (8) Loss of time awareness or time acceleration; (9) Autotelic experience; and a global second order factor encompassing all dimensions.

Perceived Emotional Synchrony:
developed by P{\'{a}}ez et al. (2015) to assess the degree inwhich participants experienced an emotional contagion or shared emotion condition (e.g., “We felt a strong, shared emotion”), and perceived synchrony with others (e.g., “We all acted as if we were one person”).

Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sports Scale 
A short, 4-item version was adapted from the CEQS-Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sports (Mart{\'{i}}nez et al., 2011)

Design and Analyses:
To analyze the effects of shared flow and emotional perceived synchrony (multiple mediation) in relation to collective efficacy, the bootstrap procedure proposed by Preacher and Hayes (2004) was applied through the SPSS macro MEDIATE for models with multiple independent variables. This analysis estimates the indirect effect, standard errors and confidence intervals

Results:
- no significant differences between different physical-sport activities in the procedural variables of the study,
shared flow [F(3, 261) = 0.218, p {\textless} 0.884] and perceived emotional synchrony [F(3, 261) = 1.56, p {\textless} 0.198]

- there were some differences between types of activities for in-
group identification [F(3, 264) = 4.44, p = 0.005], identity fusion [F(3, 267) = 6.68, p = 0.001], and collective efficacy [F(3, 270) = 4.67, p = 0.003]. Concretely, post-hoc Scheff{\'{e}} contrasts showed that in-group identification was higher for
federated teamsports (1) (M = 5.33, SE=1.06) and recreational physical activities (4) (M = 5.24, SE = 1.13) than for physical activities or sports in group (3) (M = 4.51, SE = 1.55; p = 0.011, p =0.012, respectively)

Similar differences were obtained for identity fusion between types of activities: federated team sports (1) (M = 4.96, SE = 1.30) and recreational physical activities (4) (M = 4.79, SE = 1.17) as compared to physical activities or sports in group (3) (M = 3.84, SE = 1.70; p = 0.011, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively)

Finally, participants in federated team sports reported higher collective efficacy (1) (M = 6.98, SE =1.60) than participants in recreational physical activities (4) (M = 6.18, SE =1.75, p =0.024).

Mediation Analysis: The Role of Shared Flow and Perceived Emotional Synchrony
with Others
- a significant effect of in-group identification on shared flow (B = 0.41, SE =0.07, t = 5.63, p {\textless} 0.001) and 
- perceived emotional synchrony (B = 0.45, SE =0.10, t = 4.60, p {\textless}0.001).

However, 
- no significant effect was found identity fusion -{\textgreater} on shared flow (B = −0.01, SE = 0.06, t = −0.14, p = 0.891) although 
- a significant effect was found fusion -{\textgreater} perceived emotional synchrony (B = 0.41, SE = 0.08, t = 4.91, p {\textless} 0.001)

Both, shared flow (B = 0.40, SE = 0.15, t = 2.73, p = 0.004) and perceived emotional synchrony (B = 0.32, SE = 0.11, t = 2.93, p = 0.004) were significant and positive predictors of collective efficacy

a significant effect of in-group identification (B = 0.51, SE = 0.16, t = 3.20, p = 0.001) and identity fusion (B = 0.32, SE = 0.14, t = 2.33, p = 0.021) on collective efficacy was found, confirmed by the total “accumulated” effect of the test [F(2, 245) = 57.04, p {\textless} 0.001]

once the mediating variables, shared flow and perceived emotional synchrony were introduced, it was observed that the direct effects of in-group identification and identity fusion with the group as predictor variables upon collective efficacy were not statistically significant (B = 0.20, SE = 0.16, t = 1.24, p = 0.214 y B = 0.19 SE = 0.14, t = 1.38, p = 0.168), therefore, the result is a total mediation.

On the other hand, the indirect effect of identity fusion with the group on collective efficacy through shared flow was not significant. (B = −0.003, SE = 0.02, 95{\%} [−0.064, 0.562]), although it was significant through perceived emotional synchrony (B = 0.13, SE = 0.05, 95{\%} [0.035, 0.264]). This indicates that the level of fusion with the group increases perceived collective efficacy through perceived emotional synchrony, and not through shared flow

Our results confirm our consideration about the superiority of group identity, as compared to individual identity, to promote the strengthening of collective efficacy beliefs on the part of group members.

DISCUSSION:
it is interesting to find that shared flow, an emotion related to optimal, autotelic experiences and which involves pleasurable feelings is related to in-group identification (Rim{\'{e}} et al., 2010; von Scheve and Ismer, 2013).

Unlike what happens with individual physical activities, in the collective ones, participants hold a reciprocal relationship between them, which we believe reinforces collective efficacy

In addition, it should be noted that for there to be an increase in these beliefs of efficacy, it is also vital that participants experience cognitive and affective psychological positive states (Amutio et al., 2015a), including shared flow

Fusion to Collective Efficacy not mediated by Shared Flow
Perhaps, the main reason is that fusion of identity with the group does not entail the experience of positive affection, as it is the case with flow.

studies showed that fusion with the group implies that someone is willing to sacrifice for the collectivity (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; Swann et al., 2012); therefore, it is not related to the experience of joy, but to an intrinsic interest in the task.

Something different happens with in-group identification. Identification exerts a predictive effect on shared flow, and additionally, shared flow is mediating the relationship between in-group identification and collective efficacy

The differential effects of these two components of social cohesion, in-group identification and identity fusion, support the point of view that are distinct phenomena (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; Swann et al., 2012)

WHY ARE THEY DISTINCT???



There are still very few studies focused on shared flow.
However, individual flow has been associated with a greater degree of concentration in the task and with an increase in athlete's self-efficacy (Nicholls et al., 2005; Salanova et al., 2014)

Perceived emotional synchrony implies an emotional contagion between the group members and sharing emotions among them, as well as a perceived synchronic behavior.
-DOES IT??

As several studies have shown, collective behaviors involving movement and emotional synchrony promote perceived similarity with others, emotional sharing, and unity (Rossano, 2012; von Scheve and Ismer, 2013; P{\'{a}}ez et al., 2015)

in-group identification and identity fusion involve a higher feeling of cooperation between group members and being more comfortable with physical closeness (Reicher and Haslam, 2006; Novelli et al., 2010)

CONCLUDING REMARKS

This is the first study to demonstrate the role of perceived emotional synchrony and shared flow in promoting collective efficacy in sports and physical activities.

In sports psychology, collective efficacy is a very important construct aimed at enhancing performance in team sports. 

This outcome suggests, therefore, that shared flow and emotional synchrony are collective processes occurring during collective sports and physical activities, and they substantially influence the perceived efficacy of the group

Limitations:
Cross-sectional and retrospective
In this sense alternative models will be plausible, for example, the experience of emotional synchrony or shared flow would impact collective efficacy by increasing group identification or identity fusion, or even reciprocal effects between shared flow and collective efficacy

the type of participants (students and predominantly women). Future studies will be able to use different types of samples (e.g., athletes) and more gender-balanced samples that could add more heterogeneity in sports and physical activities performed collectively

collective management of interpersonal relations and closeness among group members have shown to have implications in the collective processes experienced by athletes and non-professional practitioners
during sports and physical activities. 

Hence, when shared flow and emotional synchrony are experienced among group members perceived efficacy as a group increases and consequently their performance.

By exploring the psychosocial factors that enhance, inhibit, or disrupt collective efficacy, practitioners of sports or other related physical activities may be able to achieve optimal experiences more frequently, which, in turn, should ultimately lead them to better outcomes.

One of such interventions that can improve flow and other related positive affective states is mindfulness, a non-judgmental attentional training technique. Mindfulness involves paying attention to one's body and becoming aware of all different sensations and thoughts involved in one's actions at each moment (Aherne et al., 2011; Amutio et al., 2015b)},

abstract = {The authors propose that cross-cultural differences in sensitivity to social rejection, or the extent to which one is alert to potential rejection from significant others, can be understood as an adaptation to different social ecological contexts varying in the degrees of relational mobility. In societies low in relational mobility, such as East Asia, relationships and group memberships are stable and exclusive, and thus it is difficult for individuals to recover once rejected from current relationships or groups. In these contexts, one would expect people to be continuously paying attention to negative feedback from others to avoid potential rejection. In contrast, this type of anxiety will be less pronounced in societies high in relational mobility, such as North America, because there are a greater number of relationship alternatives available, even if individuals were to be excluded from a particular relationship. Results from two cross-national studies showed that, as expected, individuals' perceptions of relational mobility partially mediated rejection sensitivity (Study 1) and Taijin Kyofusho, an allocentric subtype of social anxiety (Study 2).},
annote = {avoiding social rejection or exclusion and becoming involved with beneficial relationships and groups is a crucial adaptive task


social rejection brings individuals not only unpleasant experiences on both cognitive and physical levels (Eisenberger {\&} Lieberman, 2004) but also can result in the concrete loss of emotional and material resources for living, which one could otherwise have received through lost relationships (Baumeister {\&} Leary, 1995)

recent studies have found that there are cross-cultural variations in sensitivity to social rejection

ejection sensitivity, defined as the anxious expectation of being rejected by people who are important to the self (Downey, Mougios, Ayduk, London, {\&} Shoda, 2004), has been found to be higher for East Asians than for North Americans (Garris, Ohbuchi, Oikawa, {\&} Harris, 2011; Yamaguchi et al., 1995)


Socio-ecological, and not cultural approach:
psychological and behavioral tendencies, which are more common in a particular society, are likely to have an adaptive function or ecological validity in the type of social contexts that are prevalent within a given society

Hs
rejection sensitivity and Taijin Kyofusho, will be higher in societies low in relational mobility in comparison with those high in relational mobility

In societies low in relational mobility, new interpersonal relationships and groups are relatively unavailable, because partners and members are bound to each other in obligatory social groups and networks (Yamagishi, Jin, {\&} Miller, 1998)

while the above argument presupposes the causal direction that relational mobility in a social ecology affects the level of people's sensitivity to social rejec- tion, the reverse causation may also operate. That is, people with greater (vs. weaker) rejection sensitivity may be more likely to create social relations and groups that are lower (vs. higher) in relational mobility.

Studies:
Study 1 compared the sensitivity levels to rejection between Japanese and Americans, and 
Study 2 compared the levels of Taijin Kyofusho between Japanese and Canadians.

Relational Mobility Scale:
Previous studies have shown that the relational mobility scale successfully mediates cultural differences in self-enhancement (Falk et al., 2009), self-disclosure (Schug et al., 2010a), similarity between friends (Schug et al., 2009), general trust (Yuki et al., 2007), shame proneness (Sznycer et al., 2012), and the association between self-esteem and happiness (Yuki et al., 2013)

social ecology is associated with the magnitude of sensitivity to social rejection that people who reside there exhibit, and that this partially predicts the cross-cultural differences in the levels of sensitivity to social rejection between North Americans and Japanese that previous research had found (Dinnel et al., 2002; Garris et al., 2011; Norasakkunkit et al., 2012; Yamaguchi et al., 1995)},

However, the authors failed to include Latin American countries in the collectivistic group. METHODS: To provide support for these earlier results within an extended sample of collectivistic countries, 478 undergraduate students from individualistic countries were compared with 388 undergraduate students from collectivistic countries (including East Asian and Latin American) via self-report of social anxiety and social vignettes assessing social norms. RESULTS: As expected, the results of Heinrichs et al. [2006: Behav Res Ther 44:1187-1197] were replicated for the individualistic and Asian countries, but not for Latin American countries. Latin American countries displayed the lowest social anxiety levels, whereas the collectivistic East Asian group displayed the highest. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that while culture-mediated social norms affect social anxiety and might help to shed light on the etiology of social anxiety disorder, the dimension of individualism-collectivism may not fully capture the relevant norms.},

abstract = {Background Between roughly 500 BCE and 300 BCE, three distinct regions, the Yangtze and Yellow River Valleys, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Ganges Valley, saw the emergence of highly similar religious traditions with an unprecedented emphasis on self-discipline and asceticism and with "otherworldly," often moralizing, doctrines, including Buddhism, Jainism, Brahmanism, Daoism, Second Temple Judaism, and Stoicism, with later offshoots, such as Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam. This cultural convergence, often called the "Axial Age," presents a puzzle: why did this emerge at the same time as distinct moralizing religions, with highly similar features in different civilizations? The puzzle may be solved by quantitative historical evidence that demonstrates an exceptional uptake in energy capture (a proxy for general prosperity) just before the Axial Age in these three regions. Results Statistical modeling confirms that economic development, not political complexity or population size, accounts for the timing of the Axial Age. Conclusions We discussed several possible causal pathways, including the development of literacy and urban life, and put forward the idea, inspired by life history theory, that absolute affluence would have impacted human motivation and reward systems, nudging people away from short-term strategies (resource acquisition and coercive interactions) and promoting long-term strategies (self-control techniques and cooperative interactions).},

abstract = {We examined the relation between pressure-induced performance decrements, or "choking under pressure," in mathematical problem solving and individual differences in working memory capacity. In cognitively based academic skills such as math, pressure is thought to harm performance by reducing the working memory capacity available for skill execution. Results demonstrated that only individuals high in working memory capacity were harmed by performance pressure, and, furthermore, these skill decrements were limited to math problems with the highest demands on working memory capacity. These findings suggest that performance pressure harms individuals most qualified to succeed by consuming the working memory capacity that they rely on for their superior performance.},
annote = {Ashcraft and Kirk (2001) examined how math anxiety undermines the performance of individuals who, in non-anxiety-provoking task domains, are highly competent.

Schmader and Johns (2003) examined the cognitive mechanisms responsible for stereotype threat in math. Stereotype threat occurs when awareness of a negative stereotype about a social group in a particular task results in less-than-optimal performance by members of that group (Steele, 1997)

And we (Beilock, Kulp, Holt, {\&} Carr, 2004) explored the cognitive processes governing ‘‘choking under pressure.'' Choking, or performing more poorly than ex- pected given one's skill, occurs in situations in which the desire for high-level performance is maximal (Beilock {\&} Carr, 2001)





WORKING MEMORY
working memory, a short-term memory system that maintains, in an active state, a limited amount of information with immediate relevance to the task at hand while preventing distractions from the environment and irrelevant thoughts (Hasher, Zacks, {\&} Lustig, in press; Kane {\&} Engle, 2000, 2002).

If the ability of working memory to maintain task focus is disrupted, perfor- mance may suffer.

Ashcraft and Kirk (2001), and other anxiety researchers (Eysenck {\&} Keane, 1990), have suggested that anxiety gener- ates intrusive worries about the situation that occupy part of the working memory capacity normally devoted to skill execution.

‘‘double whammy,'' because anxiety is an unpleasant emotion, and unpleasant emotional states reduce the working memory capacity available for any verbal infor- mation, whether necessary task information or situational wor- ries.

Schmader and Johns (2003) argued that stereotype threat also interferes with performance by consuming or reducing the working memory capacity that individuals need to perform successfully

Finally, we (Beilock et al., 2004) found support for distraction theories of choking, according to which, like anxiety, pressure creates mental distractions that compete for and reduce working memory capacity that would otherwise be allocated to skill execution.

CURRENT EXPERIMENT:
modular arithmatic tast, 
2 (high and low working memory participants) x 2 (high and low working memory demand) x 2(high and low pressure)

Participants then completed a 24-problem low-pressure test
and a 24-problem high-pressure test. The problems in each test were presented in a different random order to each participant.

The low-pressure test was described as more practice. Following this test, participants were given a scenario designed to create a high-pressure environment by involving sources of pressure commonly seen in the real world (monetary incentives, peer pressure, and social evaluation).

They were told that if they could improve their MA score by 20{\%} relative to the preceding practice trials, they would receive {\$}5

‘‘team effort'': He or she had been randomly paired with another individual, and for either person to receive {\$}5, both members of the pair had to improve

this partner had already completed the experiment and had improved by 20{\%}. If the participant improved by 20{\%}, both the participant and the partner would receive {\$}5. However, if the participant did not improve by the required amount, neither individual would receive money.

videotaped so that local math teachers and professors could examine his or her performance on this new task. The experimenter set up the video camera (0.61 m to the right of the participant) to

Filler Task

Then WM tests: OSPAN and RSPAN

RESULTS:
MA accuracy was examined in a 2 (working memory group:
LWM, HWM) ? 2 (problem demand: low, high) ? 2 (pressure: low, high) analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Asignificant three-way interaction was obtained, 
As shown in the upper left graph in Figure 1, LWMs were not influenced by pressure. This was confirmed by a 2 (problem
demand: low, high) X 2 (pressure: low, high) ANOVA, revealing a main effect of problem demand, F(1, 46)5137.13, p {\textless} .01, Zp
25.75; 
no main effect of pressure, F {\textless} 1; and 
no interaction, F(1, 46)51.70, n.s.

In contrast, a similar ANOVA with HWMs (Fig. 1, upper right graph) revealed a significant Problem Demand Pressure interaction

AlthoughHWMs'
performance on low-demand problems did not differ as a function of pressure, t(45)50.18, n.s., their performance on high-demand problems declined significantly on the high-pressure test, t(45)52.36, p {\textless} .03, d50.39

This result is consistent with the idea that pressure consumes the working memory that HWMs use for successful performance of the most difficult problems with high working memory demands.

DISCUSSION
Decrements under pressure were limited to problems that made the largest demands on working memory—as one might expect. Surpris- ingly, however, only individuals high in working memory capacity showed these decrements.

Working memory is at heart the ability to focus attention on a central task and execute its required operations while inhibiting irrelevant information (Hasher et al., in press; Kane{\&}Engle, 2000, 2002). 

The idea that pressure specifically targets individuals who have high working memory capacity carries implications for interpreting performance in real-world high-pressure situa- tions.},

Prior research cannot determine whether this uniformity results from universal patterns of behavior, or from the limited cultural variation among the university students subject pools used in virtually all prior experimental work. To address the above questions, we undertook a cross-cultural study of behavior in Ultimatum, Public Goods, and Dictator Games in fifteen small-scale societies exhibiting a wide variety of economic and cultural conditions. We found, first, that the canonical selfishness-based model fails in all of the societies studied. Second, there is more behavioral variability than had been found in previous research. Third, group-level differences in economic organization and the structure of social interactions explain a substantial portion of the behavioral variation across societies: the higher the degree of market integration and the higher the payoffs to cooperation in everyday life, the greater the level of prosociality expressed in experimental games. Fourth, individual-level economic and demographic variables do not explain game behavior, either within or across groups. Fifth, in many cases experimental play appears to reflect the common interactional patterns of everyday life.},

These games provide a valuable opportunity to generate measures of cooperation that can be compared from one place to the next, yet challenges remain in how to interpret cross-cultural differences in these experiments and connect them to cooperation in naturally occurring contexts. I address these challenges by examining framing effects in public goods games (PGGs) with salmon fishers and reindeer herders in Kamchatka, Russia. Combining standard versions of the game with versions that refer to post-Soviet institutions coordinating fishing and herding, I show that (1) average contributions in the PGG in Kamchatka are substantially higher than reported elsewhere and (2) framing the PGG alters the relationship between contributions and expectations, shifting strategies away from unconditional generosity and toward conditional cooperation. My analysis, by synthesizing quantitative analysis of PGG data with long-term qualitative ethnography, including extensive postgame interviews with participants, supports the notion that cooperation in economic games increases along with cultural norms, values, and institutions that emerge from economic interdependence. Framing effects suggest that researchers should devote more attention to investigating the relationship between contributions and expectations.},

Boyer hypothesized that conceptswith a small number of counterintuitive features are better remembered andmore faithfully communicated than extremely counterintuitive concepts or comparable ordinary or even unusual concepts. This transmission advantagemay help to explain the cross-cultural ubiquity of religious/ supernatural concepts, which often have counterintuitive features. The experiment was conducted in Second Life, an online 3D virtual world. Fifty English-speaking western participants and 51 Chinese-speaking participants from far-eastern nations viewed intuitive and counterintuitive test items and then were asked to free recall the displays immediately and after varying delays. Results show that MCI displays were not better recalled than intuitive displays at initial reporting. For both samples, however, the amount of time elapsed since exposure to the test items correlated significantly with memory degradation for intuitive concepts but not for counterintuitive concepts. These results suggest that although MCI concepts may not be more easily encoded than intuitive concepts, once they are encoded they may be more easily retrieved than intuitive concepts. Results also show that, among the westerners, increased age predicted poorer delayed recall of MCI but not intuitive items, suggesting that the MCI effect may bear most directly on transmitting ideas to adolescents and young adults},

annote = {According to the Categorization–Individuation Model (CIM), own-group face recognition biases can emerge because people catego- rize outgroupmembers but aremotivated to individuate ingroupmem- bers (Hugenberg et al., 2010),

“the motivational nature of the CIM predicts that virtually any contextually meaningful shared ingroup membership may signal the need to individuate” (p. 1173).

in the current research we tested the possibility thatwhat serves as amotivationally relevant ingroup/outgroup distinc- tion in one culturemight not in another, leading to predictable cultural differences in face recognition biases.

Face Recognition:
Hispanic–Black faceswasmanipulated tomake the targets appear to be either Hispanic or Black (MacLin {\&} Malpass, 2001). Although the facial features were identical, Hispanic Americans in this study were better at recognizingfaces that, based onthe hairstyle, appeared to be Hispanic (i.e., their racial ingroup) as opposed to Black (i.e., a racial outgroup).

face recognition accuracy for same-race faces similarly increased when participants believed that the targets belonged to the same (versus different) university (Bernstein, Young, {\&} Hugenberg, 2007; Study 1), socioeconomic group (Shriver, Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, {\&} Lanter, 2008), or minimal group as themselves (Bernstein et al., 2007; Study 2).

recognition accuracy is increased for targets categorized into the same social group as the perceiver. 

conclusion: mere social categorization alone is sufficient to elicit group-based face recognition biases (Bernstein et al., 2007)


North America: strangers who share the same social category or group (e.g., university, sports team, or race) are treated as “ingroup” members even though there is no pre-existing interpersonal relationship between them.

East Asia: the “ingroup” includes only others with whom one has direct or indirect personal ties.

North American students exhibited an own-group evaluative bias toward students in their own university,whereas Japanese students either did not demonstrate such a bias (Snibbe, Kitayama, Markus, {\&} Suzuki, 2003)or showed a reversed bias, favoring students in a competing university (Heine {\&} Lehman, 1997).

using a minimal group paradigm to artificially create two social categories, Americans were more likely to favor ingroup members when deciding the amount of a monetary bonus that other participants would receive, whereas Japanese participants showed no such bias (Falk, Heine, {\&} Takemura, 2014).


HYPOTHESES: we predicted that 

1. European Canadians would show enhanced memory for faces that shared the same minimal group (Study 1) or university affiliation (Study 2). 

2.By contrast, we expected that for East Asians, sharing the same minimal group (Study 1) or university affiliation (Study 2)would not lead to a comparable face recognition bias.


STUDY 1

METHOD:
39 European Canadians, 52 East Asians

2 (Culture: European vs. East Asian) × 2 (Target Race: White vs. East Asian) × 2 (Target Group: Ingroup vs. Outgroup)

Personality types tested to sort into minimal groups: green personality type and orange personality types. Wristbands given to members with appropriate colours.

60 faces (30 White, 30 Asian), then 120 faces, 60 new, 60 old (shown previously). Asked participants if they had seen the face before or not.

RESULTS:

In this study the CREwas evident for both European Canadians and East Asians, consistentwith previous findings (e.g., Michel et al., 2006; O'Toole et al., 1994). However, it is important to recognize that when perceptual expertise was held constant through the use of a minimal group paradigm, the anticipated cultural difference emerged.

For European Canadians, targetswho shared the same (vs. different) ex- perimentally manipulated minimal group membership were recog- nized more accurately. For East Asians, however, this effect did not emerge. As far as we are aware, this is the first known demonstration of cultural differences in cross-category face recognition biases.


STUDY 2

METHOD:
University Affiliation as categorical group

Post exclusions: 92 EC, 45 EA

Procedure similar to Study 1

RESULTS: 

- Marginal main effect of Culture: In this study, the East Asian sample showed better face recognition overall than the European Canadian sample. 

-Results also indicated a marginal main effect of Target Race: European Canadians recognized White faces better thanEast Asian faces ; however, in this
study, East Asians also showed better memory for White faces over East Asian faces

- for White faces, European Canadians again demonstrated better recognition than did East Asians

Also consistent with Study 1, for East Asian faces, there was not a significant difference in recognition accuracy between East Asian and European Canadian perceivers

the expected interaction between Culture and Target Group also emerged: Consistent with the findings of Bernstein et al. (2007, Study 1), European Canadians showed better memory for ingroup faces based on university affiliation over outgroup faces.

As predicted, however, East Asians showed
no difference in their memory for ingroup

In this study we observed the CRE for European Canadians but not
East Asians, consistent with Valentine and Endo (1992). Importantly, when university affiliation of the targetswas experimentallymanipulat- ed, the anticipated cultural difference emerged. For European Canadians, targets who shared the same university affiliation were recognized more accurately than participants from a different university. 

findings provide converging evidence that social categori- zation alone may not be sufficient to elicit face recognition biases for everyone. In cultures where ingroups are defined by pre-existing inter- personal networks, face recognition accuracy for strangers is not en- hanced by mere social categorization.

Discussion:
If there is no pre- existing interpersonal relationship between the two people, as is the case in novel face recognition, the target person is likely to remain an outgroup member no matter what social group that stranger belongs to (see also Ng, Steele, Sasaki, Sakamoto, {\&}Williams, 2015).



Future Directions:
Given that the present results suggest that themotivation to connect
with ingroupmemberswho share a broad social category is not likely to be a predominant factor underlying the CRE among East Asians, the question of why East Asians still show the CRE remains. 

Consistent with the perceptual expertise account of the CRE (Hancock {\&} Rhodes, 2008;Wright et al., 2003), it seems likely that at least some East Asian samples might have better memory for East Asian than White faces because of more extensive perceptual experience with East Asian, as opposed toWhite, faces.


On the other hand, factors other than perceptual experience may also influence cross-race face recognition accuracy among East Asians. For instance, it has been found that social targets are more likely to be recognized if they are perceived as having higher social status, being more powerful, or as being more important than those who are per- ceived as having lower social status (Ratcliff, Hugenberg, Shriver, {\&} Bernstein, 2011), being less powerful (Shriver {\&} Hugenberg, 2010), or as being less important (Ackerman et al., 2006; Baldwin, Keefer, Gravelin, {\&} Biernat, 2013), respectively.

it seemspossible that under certain conditions, such aswhen social sta- tus is manipulated, East Asian perceivers' face recognition biases might be particularlymalleable because of their cultural emphasis on social hi- erarchy and deference to authorities (Triandis {\&} Gelfand, 1998).},

abstract = {Individuals exposed to childhood adversities (CA) present with emotion regulation (ER) difficulties in later life, which have been identified as risk and maintenance factors for psychopathologies. However, it is unclear if CA negatively impacts on ER capacity per se or whether observed regulation difficulties are a function of the challenging circumstances in which ER is being deployed. In this longitudinal study we aimed to clarify this association by investigating the behavioral and neural effects of exposure to common moderate CA (mCA) on a laboratory measure of ER capacity in late adolescence/young adulthood.Our population-derived sample of adolescents/young adults (N=53) were administered a film-based ER-task during functional magnetic resonance imaging that allowed evaluation of ER across mCA-exposure.mCA-exposure was associated with enhanced ER capacity over both positive and negative affect. At the neural level, the better ER of negative material in those exposed to mCA was associated with reduced recruitment of ER-related brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporal gyrus. Additionally mCA-exposure was associated with a greater down-regulation of the amygdala during ER of negative material.The implications of these findings for our understanding of the effects of mCA on the emergence of resilience in adolescence are discussed.},

the previously observed differences in human behavior do not need to be explained by variation in the extent to which individuals care about fairness or the welfare of others.


Results strongly suggest that the previous division of humans into altruistic cooperators and selfish free riders wasmisleading.

We showed that the strategy method reveals the same division even when individ- uals are playing with computers, and nobody benefits from their cooperation. 

Instead, the variation in behavior, even in the strategy method, can be explained by variation in understanding rather than variation in social preferences.

individuals previously categorized as fair-minded conditional cooperators tend to be in- dividuals who misunderstand the nature of the game and think that, even in one-shot games, the income-maximizing decision depends on others.

DISCUSSION:
There are a number of reasons why individuals might incorrectly think that the way to best maximize their income depends on the behavior of others

1. the strategy method places an emphasis on the behavior of others, possibly suggesting their behavior is important

2. the wording of instructions to players, with words suchasinvest, couldsuggest thegameisrisky, and hence dependent on how others invest (34).

3. the best strategy for many everyday situations may depend on what others are doing, and the game reminds them of such scenarios},

In Experiment 3 we also examined pathways to "soft" (low-cost) and "hard" (high-cost) collective action. Our results supported the dual-pathway model of collective action: group-based anger and perceived group efficacy independently predicted collective action intentions to protest against increased school fees and unhygienic cafeteria conditions for Chinese university students. Group-based anger predicted soft collective action intentions; both anger and efficacy predicted hard collective action intentions. Identification with the disadvantaged group was found to moderate the problem-focused coping pathway for hard collective action intentions. For high but not low identifiers, manipulated group efficacy predicted hard collective action intentions. We discuss our findings with specific reference to collective action research in China.},

abstract = {Two experiments explored differences in depersonalized trust (trust toward a relatively unknown target person) across cultures. Based on a recent theoretical framework that postulates predominantly different bases for group behaviors in Western cultures versus Eastern cultures, it was predicted that Americans would tend to trust people primarily based on whether they shared category memberships; however, trust for Japanese was expected to be based on the likelihood of sharing direct or indirect interpersonal links. Results supported these predictions. In both Study 1 (questionnaire study) and Study 2 (online money allocation game), Americans trusted ingroup members more than outgroup members; however, the existence of a potential indirect relationship link increased trust for outgroup members more for Japanese than for Americans. Implications for understanding group processes across cultures are discussed.},
annote = {Although people in Western cultures tend to emphasize the categorical distinctions between ingroups and outgroups, East Asians may have a stronger tendency to think about groups as pre- dominantly relationship-based (Yuki, 2003)

East Asians tend to perceive themselves as a “node” embedded within a network of shared relation- ship connections (i.e., family members, friends, col- leagues, acquaintances, friends of friends, etc.) rather than within strict, bounded groups per se.

Within this framework, the ingroup for East Asians is cognitively rep- resented as a relatively stable and structured network of relationships among group members.

Whereas social identity theory identifies intergroup comparison as a key source of ingroup identificationand cooperation, Yuki's (2003) framework proposes that East Asian collectivism is largely based on the promotion of cooperative behaviors and maintenance of relational harmony within ingroups.

there is evidence to suggest that ingroup bias based on categorical distinc- tion may be in fact more pronounced in Western cul- tures than in Asian cultures (Bond {\&} Hewstone, 1988; Bond, Hewstone,Wan,{\&}Chiu, 1985; Buchan, Croson,{\&} Johnson, 2003; Gudykunst, 1988; Heine {\&} Lehman, 1997; Wetherell, 1982).

this framework does not suggest that East Asians ignore the ingroup as a meaningful social unit, and research indeed suggests that they do impose boundaries be- tween ingroups and outgroups (Gudykunst, 1988; Smith {\&} Bond, 1999).

Rather than thinking about groups as categories of depersonalized members, however, East Asians are especially concerned about maintaining a high level of knowledge about the complex relational structure within the ingroup, primarily because it is this knowledge that determines the expected behavior of individuals within the group (Aoki, 2001; Hwang, 1999; Nakane, 1970)

East Asians tend not to depict their ingroups as depersonalized entities but as complex networks of interrelated individual members.

research demonstrating that there are differ- ent bases for group entitativity and group attraction, with some groups emphasizing their categorical, de- personalized nature and others emphasizing the struc- tured relational networks and interpersonal bonds among members (Hamilton, Sherman, {\&} Lickel, 1998; Prentice, Miller, {\&} Lightdale, 1994; Seeley, Gardner, Pennington, {\&} Gabriel, 2003).

According to Yuki (2003), East Asian group members chronically perceive themselves to be personalized from and connected with those of other members, and they are aware of the exact location of the self within the group represented as a network.

previous re- search has characterized East Asian group behavior as a set of strategies to maintain mutually beneficial rela- tionships with fellow ingroup members, which eventually serve to maximize one's own personal interest (Hamaguchi, 1977; Yamagishi, Jin, {\&} Miller, 1998).

East Asian group behavior tends to place less emphasis on categorization, intergroup compari- son, and depersonalization of the self and places more emphasis on maintaining harmony within groups, being sensitive to the needs and feelings of others, and being aware of the relationship structure within the group

Both modes of group membership appear to exist in both cultures, but with chronic tendencies in both towards one or other of these modes.

“interdependent self-construal” (Markus{\&}Kitayama, 1991)
“relational self,” as defined by Brewer and Gardner (1996)

Those with interdependent selves also show an increased tendency to con- form to situational norms (H. Kim {\&} Markus, 1999), to conform to the decisions of others (Iyengar {\&} Lepper, 1999), and to mimic others' overt behaviors (van Baaren, Maddux, Chartrand, de Bouter, {\&} van Knippenberg, 2003).

Such “depersonalized trust” (Brewer, 1981) is essential for the creation and maintenance of many forms of economic exchange, organizations, and social and political institutions.

Modes/mechanisms of cooperation?

CATEGORY MEMBERSHIP:

INTERPERSONAL NETWORKS of relationships:

Asecond route involves sharing a net- work of interpersonal relations with others. Individuals may trust others if they know (or believe) that they are directly or indirectly connected to each other through mutual friendships or acquaintances (Coleman, 1990).

Hypotheses:
1.If Americans' group behavior tends to be based on the categorical distinctions between ingroups and outgroups, then depersonalized trust should be highest toward oth- ers who share an ingroup membership; 

1.1 in addition, the presence or potential for cross-group relationships should matter less to Americans than the categorical dis- tinction between ingroup and outgroup.

2. if Japanese group behavior tends to be driven more by the importance of relationship networks, then trust should be highest toward individualswhoarepresumed to share a direct or indirect network of relationships, regardless of group membership.

(Japanese should also show a high level of trust toward ingroup members, primarily because ingroup members are likely to share direct or indirect interpersonal links)

2.2 However, if an unknown outgroup member shared an indirect inter- personal connection with participants (through a personal acquaintance), this cross-group relationship link should increase trust for an outgroup member. Such a cross-group relationship link may blur the psychological boundary between the ingroup and outgroup more for Japanese than for Americans.

STUDY1:
1. Stranger in-group (most trusted)
2. Stranger out-group, 
3. Connected out-group

hypothetical scenarios that called for trust decisions to bemadetoward differentunknowntar- get persons. 

Participants completed a questionnaire packet including three different scenarios that involved a decision to trust an unknown target person based on a minimal amount of information:

1. Ask stranger to watch bags in an airport
2. loaning money in a restaurant
3. purchase concert tickets for someone over the internet


STUDY 2:

In recent years, however, these constructs have been criticized as being ill-defined and "a catchall" to represent all forms of cultural differences. The authors argue that there is a conceptual confusion about the meaning of ingroups that constitute the target of collectivism. Collectives are rarely referred to in existing measures to assess collectivism. Instead, networks of interpersonal relationships dominate the operational definition of "ingroups" in these measures. Results from a content analysis of existing scales support this observation. To clarify and expand the individualism-collectivism distinction, a theoretical framework is proposed that draws on M. B. Brewer and G. Gardner's (1996) conceptualization of individual, relational, and collective selves and their manifestation in self-representations, beliefs, and values. Analyses of data from past studies provide preliminary support for this conceptual model. The authors propose that this new theoretical framework will contribute conceptual clarity to interpretation of past research on individualism and collectivism and guide future research on these important constructs.},

Results of a survey of 122 Japanese and 126 American respondents largely supported this hypothesis. For Americans, in-group loyalty and identity with their small and large in-groups were correlated positively with perceived in-group homogeneity and in-group status. No such correlation was found for Japanese respondents, however. Instead, Japanese in-group loyalty and identity were predicted by respondents' knowledge of the relational structure within the group, knowledge of the individual differences between members of the group, and feelings of personal connectedness with in-group members.

annote = {"Faith" the idea of belief in the team, religion, community etc - is it a question of fused identity with that group? 

As many have noted, religion cannot be reduced to a mere concatenation of religious beliefs. Every religion consists of rites, rituals, prayers, social institutions, holidays, etc., that serve a wide variety of purposes, explicit or otherwise [31,32].

However, religious belief—that is, the acceptance of specific religious propositions as being true—is generally what renders these enterprises relevant, or even comprehensible.

CONTENT:
as Boyer [31,45] points out, the failure of reality testing cannot explain the specific character of religious beliefs. According to Boyer, religious beliefs and concepts must arise from mental categories and cognitive propensities that predate religion—and these underlying structures might determine the stereotypical form that religious beliefs and practices take.

These categories relate to things like intentional agents, animacy, social exchange, moral intuitions, natural hazards, and ways of understanding human misfortune

And what most religious propositions may lack in plausibility they make up for in the degree to which they are memorable, emotionally salient, and socially consequential; all of these properties are a product of our underlying cognitive architecture, and most of this architecture is not consciously accessible.

We may, in fact, be what Bloom [46] has called ‘‘common sense dualists''—that is, we may be constitutionally inclined to see mind as distinct from body and, therefore, will tend to intuit the existence of disembodied minds at work in the world.

This could lead us to presume ongoing relationships with dead friends and relatives, to anticipate our own survival of death, and to generally conceive of people as having immaterial souls.

Hood [49] posits an additional cognitive schema that he calls ‘‘supersense''—a tendency to infer hidden forces in the world, working for good or for ill.

Hood likens our susceptibility to religious ideas to our propensity to develop phobias for evolutionarily relevant threats (like snakes and spiders) rather than for things that are far more likely to kill us (like automobiles and electrical sockets).

Barrett [50] makes the same case, likening religion to language acquisition: we come into this world cognitively prepared for language; our culture and upbringing merely dictate which languages we will be exposed to.},

abstract = {Socially shared representations of history have been important in creating, maintaining and changing a people's identity. Their management and negotiation are central to interethnic and international relations. We present a narrative framework to represent how collectively significant events become (selectively) incorporated in social representations that enable positioning of ethnic, national and supranational identities. This perspective creates diachronic (temporal) links between the functional (e.g. realistic conflict theory), social identity, and cognitive perspectives on intergroup relations. The charters embedded in these representations condition nations with similar interests to adopt different political stances in dealing with current events, and can influence the perceived stability and legitimacy of social orders. They are also instrumental in determining social identity strategies for reacting to negative social comparisons, and can influence the relationships between national and ethnic identities.},
annote = {The impact of two centuries of brutal experience with Western modernity has been to harden what was previously a moral/ethical identity practiced within a context of particularistic social relations into a more categorical form of binary inclusions and exclusions consistent with other national identities in the global system of nation-states.

(1) Chinese identity is primarily defined by role-based social relations rather than clear category boundaries

(2) under conditions of low threat, traditional Chinese prescriptions for guanxi motivate ‘benevolent paternalism' rather than out-group derogation as the default script for dealings with out-group members

this categorical consciousness of national identity is historically contingent on institutional forms associated with modern states (see Anderson, 1991; Liu {\&} Hilton, 2005).



(3) under conditions of high threat, a defensive reaction in the form of nationalism fueled by a narrative of great civilization versus recent historical victimization is activated

In self-categorization theory, a person is not theorized to have a stable or singular sense of self, but rather is conceived as having a repertoire of selves at different levels of inclusiveness, from the individual (which would be just like the independent self) to the group (the critical level of analysis for this inter-group theory), but potentially ascending to an all inclusive sense of humanity

The key psychological process in group behavior is self-categorization, whereby, through a process of ‘de-personalization', individuality is temporarily submerged within conformity to a group proto- type containing idealized characteristics of the group. Hence, in self-categorization theory, it does not make sense of speak of independent and interdependent selves as culturally-inherited scripts.

Rather, each person has a repertoire of scripts for appropriate behavior that are activated in different situations (see e.g. Sarbin {\&} Allen, 1968).



Collectivism as relational orientation, not category-based difference:

Yuki (2003) argues that East-Asian collectivism is characterized by cooperation within a group as an interpersonal network.
He cites the relational orientation of Confucianism to support his claim that East-Asian collectivism is ‘an intragroup rather than intergroup phenomenon' (p. 169)

Following Brewer and Gardner (1996) and Kashima and Hardie (2000), he makes a distinction between the collective self, as a depersonalized self defined in terms of the prototypical properties shared among group members, and the relational self as defined by enduring connections and role relations with significant others, arguing that the relational self is more characteristic of East-Asian collectivism. THIS IS FUSION

Yuki found that Japanese in-group loyalty and identity were predicted by knowledge of the relational structure within the group, knowledge of individual differences within the group, and feelings of personal interconnectedness with group members, 

whereas American in-group loyalty and identity was correlated with perceived in-group homogeneity and group status.

Brewer and Chen (2007) advance the more general argument that collectivism should be properly thought of as a relational orientation across the domains of identity, agency beliefs, and obligations/values, not as a tendency to categorically identify with partic- ular in-groups, as in the social identity tradition.

Indigenous Chinese Psychology:
the five cardinal relationships, or wu lun, in setting the framework for the conduct of particular human relationships

three of the five cardinal relationships deal with family members, and that, beyond these three, many writers have argued that the Emperor-Minister relationship mirrors that of the Father-Son. The traditional ideology of Chinese society centers around the role of the benevo- lent patriarch (see Liu {\&} Liu, 2003), cast in the roles of Father, Husband, and Ruler.

Four of the five cardinal relationships involve complementary and unequal role relations that in various forms exchange benevolence on the part of the higher powered person in return for loyalty from the lower powered person.

Each person is involved in a web of social obligations to particular others, but society as a whole is woven together of many networks made of the same types of role relations. In this way, Confucianism can be considered as a universal ethic for the conduct of particular social relations (see also King {\&} Bond, 1985).

None concerns relationships between strangers. In a nutshell, it is possible to argue that a Confucian theory of statecraft is family writ large.



Historical practices of Chinese statecraft and identity

Confucian ethics require high standards for particular and committed social relations, not for civil society in general.

But, it is important to recognize that Confucianism was only the yang, or the articulated face of Chinese statecraft. In practice, ideals of benevolence and morality were accompanied by the yin of a comprehensive, well-articulated, but also draconian legal system (see Chien, 1976; Fitzgerald, 1961 for overviews of Chinese history).

Ordinary people feared magistrates and the law, regarding legal institutions more as a system of last resort than a method for ordering daily social life.

The ethics of social relations were embedded within rule-based bureaucratic practices.

Chinese society was rare and distinctive among ancient civilizations in practicing bureau- cratic meritocracy, with examinations that allowed ordinary people to become officials of state (thereby increasing the fortunes of their entire clan).

Nevertheless, meritocracy made Chinese high culture esteemed, and created a cultural psychology where education was cherished as a primary marker of Chinese identity, and a route of upward mobility

...Unlike practices in ancient Rome, where citizenship, as the official marker of Roman identity
was a legal matter of heredity and wealth, there was no formal categorical demarcation between citizens and non-citizens in ancient China.

Rather, there were degrees of power and practice between the high culture of the Confucian gentleman and the low culture of the peasant in the fields.

More than this environmental support, however, there was an ‘imagined community' (in Anderson's, 1991, terms) of China as a singular center of civilization that was more capable of regeneration than was Rome.

We believe that it was a combination of three basic factors that enabled a sense of Chineseness to endure: first, Confucian philosophy contributed a universal model of particular social relations centered on the benevolent paternalism of the Father figure.

The Confucian model of benevolent paternalism allows a seamless and integrated transition between the roles of father, husband, and ruler for dominant males; the basic social unit of the family/clan is ideologically connected to the administrative unit of the nation/state.

Second, this Chinese relationalism downplays categorical boundaries and privileges, so that there were no formal definitions, like heredity or citizenship, around being Chinese, but rather a high investment in skill-based practices requiring literacy and moral cultivation.

This class of ‘mandarins' could work with anyone, including foreigners, and in periods of collapse they could retreat to the administration of smaller units. The combination of these factors allowed the Tang dynasty restoration (618-907AD) to be a political as well as cultural renaissance for China.

Because of its geographical isolation relative to other great civilizations of the ancient world, China had no peers culturally. So, its model of international relations was a center-to-periphery model. Other peoples like Koreans and Japanese borrowed liberally from Chinese culture to establish their own states, but China imported little from its neighbors other than Buddhism from far over the Himalayas. Politically, it did not recognize any other state as an equal.


Chinese Han Humiliation: 

Two of the six longest dynasties in Chinese history were ruled by non-Han, herder peoples (Qing and Yuan) from beyond the Great Wall, a third by a Northern people who had settled in China's central plains during the period of disunity after the collapse of the Han dynasty (Tang), and a fourth dynasty (Sung) had to pay continual tribute to its Northern neighbors in order to survive.


With its immense population and sophisticated bureaucrats willing and able to serve whoever captured the Mandate of Heaven, Chinese culture had a way of assimilating its rulers

While Manchu people ruled China from 1644-1911, their culture and language virtually disappeared in the process, whereas Chinese culture took advantage of Manchurian military prowess to extend its sovereignty to Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet.

According to Chinese traditions, any dynasty that lost the Mandate of Heaven, as the Qing dynasty did when it was defeated in a series of conflicts with foreign powers beginning with the Opium War in 1839, should be overthrown.

In the Treaty-port concessions, all members of Chinese society, Manchu or Han, nobility or commoners, were considered as inferior by Westerners. Such a categorical system where one group identity transcends all other social positions like class, gender, and profession, was a shock for Chinese, whose traditional model of social relations is more consistent with role theory (Stets {\&} Burke, 2000) than this type of group-based self-categorization.

In ancient times, when martial skills like the spear, sword, horse and bow required a lifetime of training, there was no point in mobilizing the masses. Peasants were useless militarily and their consciousness of identity was rooted to the local and particular social relations of classic Confucianism.

This social logic changed with the improved technology of the gun and cannon. With the pull of a trigger, a lifetime of skill and training could be obliterated. The traditional strengths of Chinese culture, where the mass of Chinese people were peasants grounded in particularistic social relations of family/clan, and hierarchically administered by a small number of bureaucratic elites, became a weakness when the agenda was to unite and expel foreign invaders and overthrow the ruling class.

LUXUN - national shame piece

So, from the late nineteenth century on, there were persistent if only patchily successful efforts by Chinese intellectuals to create a Chinese nationalism patterned after Western forms of what we have referred to as categorical consciousness, the group consciousness associated with not only self-categorization theory, but Western imperialism and European nationalism


Western Categorical Consciousness:

European peasants were just as grounded in particularistic social relations and lacking in national consciousness as were Chinese peasants prior to the democratic and industrial revolutions of the late eighteenth century (Anderson, 1991; Smith, 1971).

However, what accelerated national consciousness in Europe was the constant warring between neighboring principalities, because after Napoleon, these wars were increasingly waged by conscript armies of ordinary men rather than professional warriors

Western colonial and imperial adventures reinforced this type of categorical consciousness even more, as any class of white person in Europe could be transformed first by a social role within some imperial project, and then into a White Person categorically superior to any Natives he was destined to encounter...

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries where militantly aggressive foreign imperialism threatened not just the ruling class of China, but the very existence of Chinese culture itself, a nationalistic form of categorical consciousness was required for survival (even today, among Hong Kong Chinese stories of war can be used to prime Chinese social identity, see e.g. Hong, Wong, {\&} Liu, 2000)


Confucianism is no more a ruling ideology for China than Catholicism is for Europe today. Both continue to exert influences as implicit theories of social organization and interpersonal relationships (Hong {\&} Chiu, 2001), and explicitly as values and beliefs driving the formulation of ideologies and discourses.

HYPOTHESES:
(1) Culture changes slowly, and so Chinese identity still takes a form whereby it is defined primarily by role-based social relations rather than analytical category boundaries;

(2) Under conditions of low threat, traditional Chinese prescriptions for guanxi motivate ‘benevolent paternalism/benevolent authority' rather than out- group derogation as the default script for dealings with out-group members,

(3) Chinese nationalism is a new invention made necessary by external threat, and so under conditions of high threat, we hypothesize that strong forms of rather reactionary nationalism (or ‘blind patriotism'), fueled by a narrative of great civilization versus recent historical victimization will be used to defend China and Chinese identity

1. Chinese identity as role-based social relations:

Nisbett et al (2001): social organization directs attention, and what is attended to influences beliefs and epistemology about the nature of the world and causal relations that structure it.

‘the authors find East Asians to be holistic, attending to the entire field and assigning causality to it, making relatively little use of categories and formal logic, and relying on ‘dialectical' reasoning, whereas Westerners are more analytic, paying attention primarily to the object and the categories to which it belongs and using rules, including formal logic, to understand its behavior' (p. 291)

Categorical versus relational reasoning:
several studies showing Chinese grouping objects according to relationships (e.g. woman and child together because the woman takes care of the baby), whereas Americans grouped the man and woman together because they belonged to the same category of adults (p. 300). Asians in their review were less likely to use formal rules for constructing categories and making inferences from them.

Furthermore, Peng and Nisbett (1997) characterized Chinese thinking as dialectic in style, based on principles of change, contradiction, and holistic relationships (see also Ji, Lam, {\&} Guo, this volume). In a variety of studies, they have showed that Chinese tended towards a ‘Middle Way' style of reasoning, whereas Americans relied more on formal logic and analytical, rule-based reasoning.

China and Minimal Group Paradigm!
Lack of evidence that the paradigm works in relational cultures:

Personal communication from Yamagishi, a leader in minimal group studies in Japan (see Yamagishi, Jin, {\&} Kiyonari, 1999, for example), however, has signaled that it took considerable effort to make the paradigm work, and that the experimenters were forced to truly rather than randomly assign participants to groups based on their preferences for Klee versus Kandinsky. This necessary amendment to the established procedure suggests less faith in abstract categories among Japanese than Westerners.

In a recent study on internet trading in East Asia, Takahashi, Yamagishi, Liu, Wang, Lin, and Yu (2008) found substantial differences among Chinese and Japanese in their willingness to trust and reciprocate trust in an experimental social dilemma: Cultural Chinese, both from mainland China and Taiwan, showed a significantly higher willingness to trust a stranger in a behavioral choice with real monetary consequences than did Japanese

Hwang's (1987) work on face and favor hypothesizes that Chinese have a precise set of rules to govern resource allocation/exchange: close, affective ties are governed by a need rule, mixed ties by a ‘renqing' or human relations rule, and instrumental, or distant relationships are governed by a fairness rule

Such a set of rules for resource exchange in social relations would be highly adaptive not only for maintaining committed social relationships (what you need I will give you, and what I need you will give me), but also for using a tit-for-tat type of fairness rule to govern the expansion of the social network to accommodate new members, initially by an instrumental fairness rule, and then over time to a renqinq or human relations rule. 

Indeed, Cheung and colleague's work on Chinese person- ality has demonstrated that beliefs about human relations form a factor of personality that cannot be folded inside the ‘Big Five' (Cheung et al, 2003).

Conclusions:


Frame-switching theory for bicultural selves:

a means for Chinese people to manage the impact of modernity more generally.

Hong, Morris, Chiu, {\&} Benet-Martinez (2000) primed bilingual Hong Konger's social identities as either Chinese or Westerners using iconic cultural images like Confucius and the Great Wall for China versus Superman and the American flag for Western cultures. Respondents were found to use more situational attributions when their Chinese identity was made salient versus more dispositional attributions when a Western identity was made salient.

The holistic, situational style of attribution is regarded as symptomatic of the East-Asian style thinking, and the dispositional style is typical of Westerners (Nisbett et al, 2001).

The basic idea is that Chinese people maintain a Chinese cultural identity in some situations, effortlessly and implicitly bringing to mind culture-appropriate scripts for thought and action according to situation, but shift to Western implicit theories (like dispositional inferences) in other situations

The empirical work of Hong et al (2000) shows that Chinese (albeit predominantly bilinguals) are perfectly capable of maintaining segmented, categorical forms of identity when the social and histor- ical conditions make such an identity adaptive.

Hong et al (2001) basically hypothesizes that people have a cultural navigation system inside their heads that allows that allows them to act according to different implicit theories or cultural norms depending on situational cues.

Surely social identity as a Chinese or Westerner must be more than an implicit theory for attributing causality to the situation versus to individuals! 

Following an historical contingency model, Liu and Liu (2003) drew a conceptual map of Chinese society being governed by a model of social relations centered around the figure of the benevolent authority, whereas in the Western model, society is governed by an impartial code of law grounded in historical precedent to which all are subordinate.


Cultural Fusion:
Given the phenomena of cultural frame switching and cultural fusion, there is no reason why Chinese societies cannot adopt their hard-won cultural scripts of benevolent authority to provide alternative means of constraining power-holders that add to the repertoire of governance developed through Western theories of individualism.

Using elements of ‘facework', like appealing to human heartedness and using public opinion to instill a sense of shame for bad behavior are traditional means for Chinese people to inculcate and cultivate desirable behavior among not only common people, but also among the political elites.},

illustrated by the many functions of these threat displays in chimpanzee society: greetings, hierarchy maintenance, group integration, intergroup boundary maintenance, and release of tension and frustration.


Shamans: Charismatic leaders at the centre of the communities political economy.

"Shamans also led raiding parties, organized communal hunts, and directed group movement. Shamans engaged in activities on behalf of a client, but generally with the entire local community (the band) participating"

The shamanic ritual was typically a
nocturnal event in which the entire local community congregated around a fire, clapping and singing while the shaman danced for hours while drumming or rattling.

A core aspect of shamanism identified
by Eliade was “ecstasy,” an altered state of consciousness (ASC) that

The ASC was induced through the effects of drumming, singing, chanting, dancing, and a variety of other procedures, including in some cases the use of psychoactive substances.

These ASC are thought to enable them to enter the spirit world and acquire supernatural powers through a vision quest experience

Other procedures used to induce these experiences included 
- fasting and water deprivation, 
- exposure to temperature extremes, 
- extensive exercise and painful austerities, 
-sleep deprivation,
- sleep and dreams, and 
- social and sensory deprivation.


Shamans generally are identified as descending from “shaman families” whose ancestors provided spirit powers. In most cultures, shamans are predominantly males; however, most cultures also allow females to become shamans, but typically limit their practice to before or after child-bearing years.

This dismemberment and reconstruction by the spirits embues shamans with powers, especially animal allies that provide assistance in healing, divination, hunting, and the ability to use sorcery to harm others.

Shamanic soul recovery involves a soul journey to do battle with the spirits to rescue the patient's lost soul. Therapeutic processes involve community participation, healing through enhancing social bonding processes, restoring a sense of identity and emotional well-being, and restoring and transforming self.


Winkelman (2002a) proposed that there should be three major pillars for the argument for a cross-culturally valid shamanism and its deep evolutionary roots:

1 Cross-cultural ethnological patterns of shamanic practitioners in premodern societies that establish a base for an ethnological analogy.

2 Direct homologies between shamanic practices and the ritual patterns of other animals, particularly our primate cousins.

3 A neuropsychological explanation for the correspondences of shamanic practices and aspects of the brain involved in altered states of consciousness.

Cross-cultural study of Shamanism: 
Validated the nature of an aboriginal hunter-gatherer shamanism worldwide, and distinguished it from other forms of shamanistic healers that emerged from that basis as a consequence of the processes of sociocultural evolution

Similar types of practitioners found in
diverse parts of the world—Eurasia, the Americas, and Africa—are more similar to one another across these different regions than they are to other magico-religious practitioners found in their own regions and even in the same society.

Shamans were found in all world regions with the exception of the Circum-Mediterranean, reflecting the lack of hunter-gatherer societies in this region (Winkelman 1986a).

statistically associated with variables measuring nomadism and a lack of political integration beyond the local community;

The practitioners empirically clustered in the group labeled “shaman” included a characteristic core to Eliade's description: someone who enters ecstasy to interact with the spirit world on behalf of the community

• a dominant social role as the preeminent charismatic leader
• a night-time community ritual
• use of chanting, singing, drumming, and dancing
• an initiatory crisis involving a death and rebirth experience
shamanic training involving induction of ASC, particularly with fasting and social isolation
• an ASC experience characterized as a soul journey (but not possession)
• ASC involving visionary experiences
• abilities of divination, diagnosis, and prophecy
• illness caused by spirits, sorcerers, and the intrusion of objects or entities
• healing processes focused on soul loss and recovery
• animal relations as a source of power, including control of animal spirits
• the ability of the shaman to transform into animals
• malevolent acts, or sorcery, including the ability to kill others, and
• hunting magic, assistance in acquiring animals for food

Shamans are a social universal, found worldwide under specific kinds of social conditions—hunter- gatherer societies as well as some slightly more complex nomadic hor ticultural and pastoral societies.

These ASC, 
spirit relations, and 
community rituals 
are human cultural universals; however, these activities are associated with different types of practitioner in more complex societies (Mediums, Healers, and Shaman/ Healers). Winkelman (1990, 1992) proposed the term “shamanistic healers” to refer to these universally distributed practitioners who use ASC for training, healing, and divination.

The Snug Fit (is embodied):
This involves placing the patient's circumstances within the broader context of cultural mythology, and ritually manipulating these relationships to emotionally transform the patient's self and emotions. 

Ritual manipulation of unconscious psychological and physiological structures enable a variety of emotional healing responses, reflected in the psychodynamic differences in soul journey, possession, and meditation.



The Socioeconomic Transformation of Shamans and Shamanistic Healers:

Hunter gatherer - sedentary agricultural, political integration, emergence of class structures...

Nonetheless, the innate bases of ASC and endogenous healing processes assured the persistence of ASC- based healing practices in more complex societies.

The transformation of shamanic practices into other types of shamanistic healers and magico-religious practitioners is a function of
1 agriculture replacing hunting and gathering

2 transformation of nomadic lifestyle to fixed residence patterns

3 political integration of local communities into hierarchical societies, and

4 social stratification, the creation of classes and castes and hereditary slavery

These involve three major functional dimensions with biosocial bases:

1 the psychobiological basis in ASC (shamanistic healers)

2 the role of social-political and religious leadership (priests), and

3 the conflict of shamanistic healers and priests, manifested in the sorcerer/ witch

Shamans were the original source of ASC traditions, and provided the social leadership potentials at the basis of priesthoods. Shamanistic practitioners were eventually persecuted by priestly religious structures, giving rise to a phenomenon recognized as witchcraft (see Winkelman 1992, 2004b).

The Ancient Emergence of Priesthoods:

new form of ritual development in prehistory during the early Upper Paleolithic:

hunter-gatherer groups developed more complex transegalitarian societies. A new form of religion emphasized public feasts in which large amounts of food were used in extravagant ritual displays by elite groups.

These rituals focused on group fertility and worship of elite ancestors as gods, enhancing the leaders' status and providing a context for the integration of larger groups of people.

Food, art, monumental architecture, and public ritual were material resources for exercising influence by these elites. These rituals used public feasting as a means of ensuring alliance, exchanging commodity items to increase wealth, power, and prestige.


Hayden calls these public rituals a turning point in the evolution of religion—a dramatic shift from popular cults focused on earlier shamanic practices of ASC induction to elite cults that enabled the elites to manipulate their communities through religious rituals and symbols.

Through ritual exchange elites controlled social life—wealth exchanges, bride exchanges, arranging marriages, social alliances, debt payments, and allocation of resources in times of scarcity. 

Central parts of this new elite-focused religion were warfare, human sacrifices, and megalithic architecture.

The Biological Bases of Shamanic Universals

This approach implicates shamanic universals in terms of innate modules, natural structures and processes of the human organism:

1 the biogenetic functions of ritual as a communication, social coordination and community bonding processes based in the mammalian attachment processes (the social-bonding system involving opioid mechanisms; see Kirkpatrick 2005)

2 altered states of consciousness that elicit the integrative mode of consciousness through inducing highly synchronized slow brainwave discharge patterns that produce coherence and coordination across the levels of the brain

3 integration of fundamental bodily and visual representational structures of consciousness manifested in the shamanic soul flight and visionary experiences

4 manipulation of innate representational modules or cognitive operators related to identity formation, manifested in spirits as allies and social representation systems (i.e., totemism)

5 elicitation of visionary information capacities of presentational symbolism, a somatic and imagetic preverbal system

6 integration of thought through metaphoric representation system involving the use of the body and animals as personal and social representations, and

7 healing processes based in the effects of ASC, hypnotic capacity, and associated placebo effects

These innate modules and their
integrations provided the basis for a variety of metaphoric predication characteristic of shamanic thought and practice:

Animism (other with self properties) 
Animal spirits (animals with self properties) Totemic groups (social groups with animal species properties)
Animal identities (self properties explained with animal species) 
Out-of-body experiences (self and visual systems dissociated from spatial system) Possession (self module dominated by other module)

Biogenetic Structuralist Approaches to the Origins of Human Ritual: signaling for coordinated social responses to behaviour (COOPERATION)

Ritual is integral to vertebrate social life, providing mechanisms for communication that are basic to social coordination (d'Aquili et al. 1979). Such animal rituals use behaviors, manifested in actions, which signal a disposition for social behaviors.

Animals' rituals have communication and social signaling functions, using genetically-based behaviors to provide information that facilitates interactions among members of a species, coordinating their behaviors in ways that contribute to cooperation.

By making internal dispositions publicly available, animal rituals contribute to cooperative behaviors by providing information that helps produce socially coordinated responses.

Displays of Great Apes
Shamanic rituals involve vocalizations such as singing and chanting that originated in the same biological structures and functions underlying activities that Lawick-Goodall (1968) called chimpanzee “rain dances,” and similar displays called “carnivals” by Reynolds (2005). 

circumstances: 
nesting and awakening; 
meeting or splitting up of a group; 
before and during moving to new feeding areas; when on the move; 
in responses to hearing others' calls and drumming; 
when large numbers congregated in a limited area; and
when encountering human observers.

Noting the religious-like elements of these displays, Goodall suggested that “[w]ith a display of strength and vigor such as this, primitive man himself might have challenged the elements” (Lawick-Goodall 1971: 53)


Group and Intergroup Ritual Processes in the Great Apes: Baselines for Hominin Ritual

commonalities among the great apes in these locomotor displays involving kicking, stomping, shaking branches, beating on the chest, ground, or vegetation, and jumping and running (Geissmann 2000).

vocalisation during conditions of high arousal used for social contact and interpersonal spacing

The great apes' call episodes fulfill similar functions: interindividual and intergroup communication, related particularly to location, spacing, food sources, and danger; this expressive system of communicating emotional states motivates other members of the species and enhances group cohesion and unity

Their structural and behavioral similarities indicate that primate calls are the communicative precursors of human singing and musical abilities (Wallin, Merker and Brown 2000; Molino 2000).

The power derived from these “noisy displays” is illustrated in the case of the chimpanzee called Mike. Mike was a low-ranking male when he began using empty kerosene cans which he bounced and hit in front of him while making aggressive charges. These displays quickly catapulted him to alpha-male status without ever having to attack the other males (see Goodall 1986: 426–7).


These similarities include
• the most dramatic ritual activity of the community
• displays involving an upright posture and charge
• aggressive display by a charismatic alpha male to manifest dominance
• emotional vocalizations that provide information about individual states
• drumming, including the use of hands and sticksThese similarities include
• the most dramatic ritual activity of the community
• displays involving an upright posture and charge
• aggressive display by a charismatic alpha male to manifest dominance
• emotional vocalizations that provide information about individual states
• drumming, including the use of hands and sticks
• activities that unite and protect the entire group, often oriented to a tree, and sometimes occurring at night

shamans' healing practices involves physical manipulations of the body, including massage.

In the diagnostic phase the shaman may carefully inspect all parts of the body, prodding lumps and abscess and cleansing them through a variety of procedures homologous with primate grooming activities

Shamanism expanded these ancient
phylogenetic bases manifested in primate and hominin ritual capacities into much more prolonged display activities involving extensive drumming, dancing, and music, extending them throughout the night.

Night-time ritual allowed for an integration of the cognitive processes involved in dreaming. Dream experiences, combined with drumming, singing, and other factors, eventually produced altered states of consciousness known as mystical experiences.

These ASC became central features of the new forms of ritual experience that were at the focus of shamanism and its healing practices. 

These experiences were enhanced, perhaps even driven, by the capacity for mimesis, a by-product of bipedalism (see Donald 1991, 2001), which provided an expanded capacity for symbolism through enactment. There



There was also an evolution of the human healing capacity (see Bulbulia 2006; McClennon 2002, 2006), derived from the capacity for suggestibility (hypnosis) and the healing effects from the capacity for music (see Crowe 2004).},

abstract = {Shamanic referents in Upper Palaeolithic cave art indicate its pivotal role in the MiddleUpper Palaeolithic transition. Etic models of shamanism derived from cross-cultural research help articulate the shamanic paradigm in cave art and explicate the role of shamanism in this transition. Shamanism is found cross-culturally in hunter-gatherer societies, constituting an ecological and psychosociobiological adaptation that reflects the ritual and cosmology of early modern humans. Shamanism played a role in cognitive and social evolution through production of analogical thought processes, visual symbolism and group-bonding rituals. Universals of shamanism are derived from innate modules, particularly the hominid mimetic controller and music and dance. These induced altered states of consciousness, which produce physiological, cognitive, personal and social integration through integrative brain-processing. Shamanic altered states of consciousness have the cross-modal integration characteristic of the emergent features of Palaeolithic thought and facilitated adaptations to the ecological and social changes of the Upper Palaeolithic. Cross-modular integration of innate modules for inferring mental states (mind), and social relations (self/others), and understanding the natural world (classificatory schemas) produced the fundamental forms of trope (metaphor) that underlay analogical representation. These integrations also explain animism (mental and social modules applied to natural domains); totemism (natural module applied to social domain); and guardian spirit relations (natural module applied to self and mental domains).},

These induced altered states of consciousness, which produce physiological, cognitive, personal and social integration through integrative brain-processing

The presence of shamanic practices in hunter-
gatherer societies cross-culturally and their striking similarity indicates that shamanism has a psycho- biological basis.




This complex of related beliefs and practices found cross-culturally in hunter-gatherer and some agricultural and pastoral societies is not the result of diffusion (as assessed by autocorrelation analyses: Winkelman 1986a)
Rather, these cross-cultural simi- larities are the consequence of independent inven- tions, or derivations, from a common neuropsychology:

These include 
visionary experience, 
soul journey, 
guardian spirit quest, 
healing practices, 
and self-transformation experiences such as death and rebirth.

Cross-cultural research reveals that shamans are charismatic social and religious LEADERS in hunter-gatherer (or simple agricultural and pastoral) societies where political integration and leadership is limited to the level of the local community

Shamans led activities in which the en- tire local community participated, as well as directing hunting, warfare, and group movement

Ritual activities most frequently involved healing and divi- nation; but shamans were also thought capable of sorcery — malevolent magical acts designed to harm others. The shamanic ritual was typically an all-night ceremony attended by the entire community. 

The shaman chanted, sang, shouted and danced vigor- ously to enact a dramatic encounter with the spirit world while the audience chanted, sang and drummed in supportive unison. Through imitation and mimicry, shamans enacted a dramatic emotional struggle with the spirits.

Shamans used a variety of induction procedures2 to enter altered states of con-
sciousness (ASC) for their training and professional service to their communities




Mimesis and cognition:

Donald (1991, 168–9) character- izes mimetic skill or mimesis as derived from the ability to consciously produce intentional represen- tations of the structure of events through their re- enactment, usually through mimicry and imitation.

Mimesis is a form of human symbolic thinking which can operate independently of language through anal- ogy, using episodic memory to epitomize events (Donald 1991).

The mimetic expres- sions found in basic emotions constitute the funda- mental aspects of human non-verbal communication. Donald suggests that mimetic skills involving inten- tional representations and performed in group con- text provided the basis for primitive group ritual and dances, where reciprocal mimetic enactments were first performed

Demographic and social changes of the Upper Palaeolithic:
Adaptations to severe environments required future planning and group communication for decision-making and logistical organization.

Increasing the number of decision-mak- ers requires serial or vertical hierarchicization of status differences. 

Successful adaptation also neces- sitated information about other groups and the envi- ronment, particularly information with a time depth in order to adapt to resource fluctuations.

Locating mates without establishing access pro- duces group stress, conflicts, and tensions. Access is assured through alliance networks (Gamble 1986) which use symbolic communication to establish re- lationships that allow extension of reciprocal rela- tions with people with whom one has not established face-to-face contact. 

These interactions provide social relations that
induce healing responses that are part of the primate heritage involved in the care of sick and injured conspecifics through altruistic behaviours (Fabrega 1997).

The release of endogenous opiates is produced by aspects of community ritual (Frecska {\&} Kulcsar 1989) and by a number of physical activities associ- ated with shamanic altered states of consciousness (see Prince 1982; Winkelman 1986b; 1992; 1997)


Shamanic practices involving the participation of all band members provided the context for the expression and integration of multiple identities.

These changes are manifested in artefacts which reveal an emblematic group membership and an as- sertive expression of individual personality, indi- viduality or within-group differentiation of roles, status, and identity.

The selective pressures creating these prominent social characteristics were derived from intense competition with conspecifics, combined with the need to cooperate. Alexander (1989, 469) suggests that the dominance of humans on the one hand, and ‘runaway social competition' on the other, led to unique mental characteristics as a result of humans being ‘their own principal hostile forces of nature'

Human ecological dominance minimized the importance of the physical environment in selection, making conspecifics the most important aspect of (and threat from) the environment. This produced se- lection for sociality and group living as a necessary adaptation.

The social aspects were the most unpre- dictable and demanding aspects of the human envi- ronment, leading to further selection of human mental abilities, supporting cooperation and reciprocity.

The human reliance upon increasing interdependence requires a broadening of social interaction, reciproc- ity, and sociability and the coordination of face-to- face social interaction as part of the ‘mind's natural environment'. This natural environment comprised of conspecifics, and the structures they provide as a group, affects human adaptation.

‘Fitness should have been correlated with the evolution of perceptual, affective, and cognitive processes that support the development and mainte- nance of group membership [and] develop, main- tain, and negotiate face-to-face group membership' (Caporeal 1996, 266).

Caporeal points out that the definition of self is in relationship to shared group memberships which are constructed in a hierarchical organization. Mem- bership in different groups creates different social identities.

Ethnographic and ethnological analogy suggests
that shamanic practices were central to the coordina- tion that occurs within bands and macro-band lev- els. The practices of shamanism, which require the participation of all present, and which provide the context for the expression of multiple identities, was the social activity and mechanism by which these multiple personal identities and multiple group iden- tities were mediated and integrated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to examine the psychometric properties of a Chinese translation of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (HK-PCS). DESIGN/PATIENTS: Patients aged 18-79 years (N = 130) with chronic nonmalignant pain attending an outpatient multidisciplinary pain center in Hong Kong participated in this cross-sectional study. METHOD: Subjects completed a set of health-related instruments: HK-PCS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, SF-36 Health Survey, and a general demographic questionnaire. Data were analyzed for the distribution, internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity. RESULTS: A satisfactory internal consistency was found (alpha = 0.927). The item-total correlation coefficients ranged from 0.575 to 0.777. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.969 for the total HK-PCS score, 0.956 for helplessness, 0.945 for magnification, and 0.910 for rumination. Confirmatory factor analysis verified a second-order factor structure with the comparative fit index = 1.00, root mean square error of approximation = 0.038, and normed fit index = 0.99 (chi(2) ((58)) = 68.84, P = 0.16). Significant correlations were found for pain intensity, disability, anxiety, and depression (r = 0.223-0.597, P {\textless} 0.01). The general health, social function, role emotional, and mental health domains of the SF-36 consistently demonstrated negative association with catastrophizing across all HK-PCS scores (r =-0.279 to -0.396, P {\textless} 0.01). No gender difference was noted for HK-PCS scores (P {\textgreater} 0.05), which is contrary to the existing literature. CONCLUSION: This study has illustrated satisfactory psychometric properties of the HK-PCS. We provide evidence for the validity and reliability of the HK-PCS as an instrument for measuring pain catastrophizing in the Chinese patient with chronic pain.},

I discuss recent imaging studies which may contribute to a better understanding of the culture-ready brain. Taken in conjunction with fossil and archaeological data, the findings seem more consistent with a ‘play and display' hypothesis of hominid brain expansion than with current cognocentric hypotheses, suggesting new directions for research.

The evidence supports the conclusion that these three emotions are marked by qualitatively different attributes. Probes into emotional life serve to reveal aspects of face and self.

annote = {First, we study guilt, shame and embarrassment from a Chinese cultural perspective, relying on evidence derived from cultural data on expressions of emotion and empirical studies of losing face

the Christian conception of sin is alien to Chinese culture; in particular, the notion of original sin runs counter to ancestral worship

Secondly, the biblical account of original sin has clear sexual overtones. Lust and sex are central to the doctrine of original sin.

pudenda (human external genitalia, especially of a woman; from the Latin pudere, meaning to cause shame).

In contrast, the Confucian tradition accepts sexuality per se as part of human nature. However, sexual activities outside the bounds of propriety are condemned. A more complete acceptance of sexuality is found in Daoism, which views sexual activity as a natural manifes- tation of the yin–yang cosmic principle

Given the Confucian ethical tradition grounded in interpersonal relationships, rather than in the human person's relationship with God, how would the emotions of guilt, shame and embarrassment be experienced differently?

Interpersonal domain of emotions in China:
Wang and Fischer (1994) have tabulated more than 150 words for varieties of guilt, shame and embarrassment in Chinese, but only a few dozen at most in English.

Captured in the linguistic data are close associations between shame and facial expression or visual exposure.

PUCLIC EMOTIONS (guilt, shaming)

Public shaming is instrumental to socialization and is a potent sanction. For instance, shaming through public humil- iation (e.g. wearing a dunce's cap) is a common practice in Confucian societies.

Confucian classics give the impression that there is little or no room for the spontaneous expression of emotions—in contrast to vernacular expressions, which depict a richer, less constrained and more realistic emotional life.

The implication of lianpu boils down to this: just as identity is defined by lianpu on stage, it is inseparable from the social position one occupies and the role one plays in real life.

In Confucian societies, the demands of classic propriety and protocol are severe. Given a rigidly hierarchical, authoritarian social order, authority and role relationships, rather than individual sentiments, are potent determinants of what and how emotions may be expressed.

Those in superior positions have to maintain tight control, because they are expected to meet stricter demands of propriety and protocol.

For those in inferior positions, controlling emotional expressions serves a defensive function. Tight control is necessary for protecting one's safety—in the form of non- expression.

Aperson in an inferior position has to show modesty; for him, it is a necessity. But a person in a superior position gains greater face for himself when he acts in a modest manner.

Thus, caution must be exercised in perceiving other people's emotional expressions to avoid misreading, committing blunders or being deceived.

In contrast, the comfort in zhenqing one longs for may be found in trusting and intimate relationships. In large measure, then, emotional life is relationship-specific, in terms of both perception and expression.

HUGE mistrust of the social world outside intimate relational networks

Relationship dominance refers to the potency of interpersonal relationships, relative to personality and situational factors, as a determinant of social actions (Ho, Peng, Lai, {\&} Chan, 2001).

Where relationships predominate, social actions follow not so much from the individual's own volition, sentiments or needs as they do from the individual's perception of his or her relationships with other people.

Losing Face

two types of face:

1. mianzi, achieved through success and ostentation; and 

2. lian, which represents the confidence of society in the integrity of one's moral character (Ho, 1994).

Losing face: a damaging social event, in which one's action is publicly given notice and negatively judged by others, result- ing in a loss of moral or social standing (cf. Ho, 1994)

Losing face is damaging because failure to maintain or protect one's face has adverse implications for social functioning.

The event is public because an audience, real or implied, is required and is collectively observed.

It involves evaluative judgments, not by the actor himself, but about the actor by others. 

In short, losing face is a public, discrete and damaging social event for the actor concerned.

Accordingly, losing face does not, in itself, refer to a private emotion

the actor's experience of losing face is commonly, though not necessarily, accompanied by dysphoric emotions.

an actor may play the game of face with emotional detachment; the degree of ego involvement is low

The key with costly group exercise: you can't play the social game without emotional detachment

Dysphoric emotions and losing face:

Chu (1983) finds that threats to one's face may result in an admixture of dysphoric emotions such as feeling oppressed, anxious, angry, ashamed and guilty. 

Bedford (2004) reports that diulian (losing face) may encompass feelings of guilt, shame or both

Lau, Chiu and Ho (1997) find that diulian is commonly accompanied by embarrassment, flushing, wanting to hide, feeling inhibited, inferior, self-conscious or exposed. 

Lau et al. (1997), four groups of participants took part. Each group was asked to recall a recent event involving an experi- ence belonging to the following categories: lost face, almost lost face, embarrassed and almost embarrassed.

physiological reaction?

However, group differences were found in the perception of agency, that is, whether one has affected, or is capable of affecting, the situation in question. Relative to the lost face group, more of the participants in the embarrassed group perceived themselves as playing an active role in the recalled event, feeling surprised, and being accepted by those who were present.

Thus, losing face and embarrass- ment can be differentiated in terms of the perception of agency.

Lau et al. (1997) also obtained data on losing face and embarrass- ment in terms of their affinity to different emotions (e.g. shame, guilt, humiliation).

Cluster analysis located losing face and fear in the same cluster; embarrassment and being insulted were located in another

Firstly, the emotions accompanying losing face are far more encompassing than embarrassment. In particular, guilt may also be experienced. Secondly, losing face has greater affinity to shame than to embarrassmen


Guilt: Morality, Internalization and Responsibility

"imaginary auditory experience": when our inner voice talks to us..
Guilt is primarily an imaginary auditory experience. We experience guilt when our conscience, our inner voice, speaks to us. 

The judgmental-evaluative dimension underlying guilt is moral. Personal responsi- bility, direct or indirect, is involved. Guilt is experienced when acts of transgression are committed

The origin of conscience, and hence of guilt, is external authority and moral values internalized},

abstract = {The emotions of guilt and shame are pervasive in daily life. They help maintain a sense of personal identity (Hultberg, 1988; Scheff, 1988), function as mechan- isms of social control (Creighton, 1988), and provide channels for processing stress or norm violation into self-punishment (Lebra, 1988). Guilt and shame subtly shape behavior, often by causing people to behave so as to avoid experi- encing them. It is unlikely that any society could be maintained without them (Creighton, 1988). There is considerable empirical and theoretical agreement that the subjective experience of guilt is accompanied by feelings of violation of the moral order and responsibility for negative outcome (DeRivera, 1984; Lindsay-Hartz, 1984). If responsibility is not accepted and there is only fear of the consequences of the action, then guilt is not experienced in the true sense. In order to feel guilt, an individual must first of all (rightly or wrongly) bear some feeling of responsibility for the transgression (Izard, 1977). Following from this relationship between guilt and responsibility, there are four propositions that have a logical connection to guilt (Bedford, 1990): belief in the possibility to have acted otherwise, acceptance of the legitimacy of blame and punishment, hope of atonement, and the inability to cause another to feel guilt. If guilt is necessarily connected to responsibility, then it is not possible to put other persons into a state of guilt unless they are willing or capable of accepting responsibility. The inability to place persons in a state of guilt without their accepting responsibility makes guilt a suitable basis for a system of morality. In fact, research has suggested Americans experience guilt as},

abstract = {In this article, the authors integrate the seemingly disparate literature on culture and emotion by offering a biocultural model of emotion that offers three premises heretofore not introduced in the literature: (1) emotions need to be distinguished from other affective phenomena, (2) different types of emotions exist, and (3) within any emotion different domains can be studied. Previous controversies have occurred because writers have called all affective states “emotion” without regard to the type or domain of emotion sampled. The authors argue that not all affective states should be called emotion, that emotions that may be biologically innate are different than those that are not, and that different domains of emotion are more relatively influenced by biology or culture. The authors offer researchers a terminology—biological versus cultural emotions, Priming Reactions, Subjective Experience, and Emotional Meanings—provide hypotheses concerning the relative contributions of biology and culture, review the available literature that supports those hypotheses, and argue that the literature can be somewhat neatly integrated into a cohesive whole. The authors contend that the relative contribution of biological and cultural factors to emotion depends on what emotion is being studied and the specific domain of emotion assessed. While the authors acknowledge that their delineations are not the only or the best delineations that can or should be used, they contend that some kind of delineations should be made and can help to synthesize and integrate a large and seemingly disparate, contradictory literature. The authors offer theirs as a first step in this effort.},

abstract = {Experimental pain research indicates ethnic differences in pain experience. Most of the cross-cultural pain research studied African Americans and Hispanics with little data available for Asian groups. This study examined differences in pain catastrophizing, pain attitudes, and pain responses between Chinese and European Canadian young adults. Prior to completing a cold-pressor (CP) task, 80 Chinese and 80 European Canadian undergraduate students were administered measures of pain catastrophizing and pain attitudes, including stoicism and cautiousness. Pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain intensity were measured during the CP task. The Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire was administered immediately postimmersion to measure sensory and affective pain. While there was no group difference in pain threshold and pain intensity, Chinese participants displayed lower pain tolerance and reported higher SF-MPQ-Affective than European Canadians. Regarding psychological variables, there was no difference in stoicism and cautiousness between groups, but Chinese participants reported greater pain catastrophizing. Mediational analysis indicated that pain catastrophizing mediated the group differences in SF-MPQ-Affective score. The implications of the findings and future research were discussed. Perspective: The study found ethnic differences in cold-pressor responses, in which Chinese undergraduates reported higher levels of pain compared to their Euro-Canadian counterparts. The finding that pain catastrophizing mediated the ethnic difference in SF-MPQ-Affective scores indicated the importance of examining the role of catastrophizing in pain reports from Chinese and Euro-Canadian patients. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Accruing evidence suggests that DM brain systems activated during rest are also important for active, internally focused psychosocial mental processing, for example, when recalling personal memories, imagining the future, and feeling social emotions with moral connotations. Here the authors review evidence for the DM and relations to psychological functioning, including associations with mental health and cognitive abilities like reading comprehension and divergent thinking. This article calls for research into the dimensions of internally focused thought, ranging from free-form daydreaming and off-line consolidation to intensive, effortful abstract thinking, especially with socioemotional relevance. It is argued that the development of some socioemotional skills may be vulnerable to disruption by environmental distraction, for example, from certain educational practices or overuse of social media. The authors hypothesize that high environmental attention demands may bias youngsters to focus on the concrete, physical, and immediate aspects of social situations and self, which may be more compatible with external attention. They coin the term constructive internal reflection and advocate educational practices that promote effective balance between external attention and internal reflection.},

abstract = {The anterior insula (AI) maps visceral states and is active during emotional experiences, a functional confluence that is central to neurobiological accounts of feelings. Yet, it is unclear how AI activity correlates with feelings during social emotions, and whether this correlation may be influenced by culture, as studies correlating real-time AI activity with visceral states and feelings have focused on Western subjects feeling physical pain or basic disgust. Given psychological evidence that social-emotional feelings are cognitively constructed within cultural frames, we asked Chinese and American participants to report their feeling strength to admiration and compassion-inducing narratives during fMRI with simultaneous electrocardiogram recording. Trial-by-trial, cardiac arousal and feeling strength correlated with ventral and dorsal AI activity bilaterally but predicted different variance, suggesting that interoception and social-emotional feeling construction are concurrent but dissociable AI functions. Further, although the variance that correlated with cardiac arousal did not show cultural effects, the variance that correlated with feelings did. Feeling strength was especially associated with ventral AI activity (the autonomic modulatory sector) in the Chinese group but with dorsal AI activity (the visceral-somatosensory/cognitive sector) in an American group not of Asian descent. This cultural group difference held after controlling for posterior insula (PI) activity and was replicated. A bi-cultural East-Asian American group showed intermediate results. The findings help elucidate how the AI supports feelings and suggest that previous reports that dorsal AI activation reflects feeling strength are culture related. More broadly, the results suggest that the brain's ability to construct conscious experiences of social emotion is less closely tied to visceral processes than neurobiological models predict and at least partly open to cultural influence and learning.},

According to most current theories, states in modality-specific systems for perception, action and emotion do not represent knowledge - rather, redescriptions of these states in amodal representational languages do. Increasingly, however, researchers report that re-enactments of states in modality-specific systems underlie conceptual processing. In behavioral experiments, perceptual and motor variables consistently produce effects in conceptual tasks. In brain imaging experiments, conceptual processing consistently activates modality-specific brain areas. Theoretical research shows how modality-specific re-enactments could produce basic conceptual functions, such as the type-token distinction, categorical inference, productivity, propositions and abstract concepts. Together these empirical results and theoretical analyses implicate modality-specific systems in the representation and use of conceptual knowledge.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT— Recent advances in neuroscience are highlighting connections between emotion, social functioning, and decision making that have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the role of affect in education. In particular, the neurobiological evidence suggests that the aspects of cognition that we recruit most heavily in schools, namely learning, attention, memory, decision making, and social functioning, are both profoundly affected by and subsumed within the processes of emotion; we call these aspects emotional thought . Moreover, the evidence from brain‐damaged patients suggests the hypothesis that emotion‐related processes are required for skills and knowledge to be transferred from the structured school environment to real‐world decision making because they provide an emotional rudder to guide judgment and action. Taken together, the evidence we present sketches an account of the neurobiological underpinnings of morality, creativity, and culture, all topics of critical importance to education. Our hope is that a better understanding of the neurobiological relationships between these constructs will provide a new basis for innovation in the design of learning environments.},

丢脸：

the central issue with diu lian is the loss of reputation or standing in the eyes of other people. The girl is not upset because she has done something wrong. She is distressed at the thought that she has lost face with others

One loses face when one's social presentation is perceived to be at odds with the status and values that one has claimed for oneself.

This means that if nobody else knows about the failure event then one will not experience diu lian.

An audience is necessary to the experience

Diu lian also involves the feeling of not having lived up to standards or values. 

These are not the standards or values that one holds with regard to all people; they are not part of a universal standard for being a ‘good' or ‘worthy' human being. 

Rather, these are the standards that individuals hold for them- selves and the standards they recognize that other people have come to expect them to uphold in order to maintain their reputation, or the reputation of persons of their status. 

The higher a person's status, the more vulnerable that person is to losing lian.

Diu lian may be experienced either because of one's own behavior or because of that of friends or family to whom one's reputation is tied

One might experience diu lian through one's own actions under two conditions:

1. When one fails to live up to one's own reputation and others know about it, one will likely experience diu lian: it may be the case that one has or believes one has the capacity to meet the standard, but for whatever reason one has simply failed to meet it

2. Second, it can also be the case that one knows one does not have the ability, but experiences diu lian because others expect one to have it. It is not one's self-conceptualization that is threatened by these kinds of failure; rather it is one's social presentation that is at stake. The exposure of the failure to live up to one's reputation is what causes diu lian.

The young woman in the example was not particularly ashamed of the B+ until her father found out about it.

One also experiences diu lian when someone else violates one's standards or in some way puts one's reputation in jeopardy. 

diu lian is felt for oneself when another person violates one's personal standards (FUSION!)},

We highlight some networks of the social brain relevant to two-person interactions and consider the social signals between interacting partners that activate these networks. We make a case for distinguishing between signals that automatically trigger interaction and cooperation and ostensive signals that are used deliberately. We suggest that this ostensive signalling is needed for 'closing the loop' in two-person interactions, where the partners each know that they have the intention to communicate. The use of deliberate social signals can serve to increase reputation and trust and facilitates teaching. This is likely to be a critical factor in the steep cultural ascent of mankind.},
annote = {Wemake a case for distinguishing between signals that automatically trigger interaction and cooperation and ostensive signals that are used deliberately.

The Social Brain:
1. ‘theory of mind', which enables us to predict what others are going to do on the basis of their desires and beliefs. 
2. It also has a ‘mirror system', which enables us to understand others' goals and intentions and to empathize with their emotions by a mechanism of motor resonance. 

Both these components of the social brain are activated by social signals, which can be dealt with as 1) INVOLUNTARY and 2) DELIBERATE signals


INVOLUNTARY SOCIAL SIGNALS:

Every time we move we send out involuntary signals about ourselves (this has been termed ‘public infor- mation'; Danchin et al. 2004). 

1. Biological Motion:
Experiments have shown that biological motion can be picked out from other types of motion (Scholl {\&} Tremoulet 2000). Furthermore, gender and emotion can be recognized from the move- ments of a point-light walker (Kozlowski {\&} Cutting 1977; Dittrich et al. 1996).

2 . intuitive attribution of mental states (Castelli et al.2000).
It is remarkably easy to imbue even a shapeless object with intentions as long as it appears to move in response to something you do or say (Johnson 2003)
This suggests that perception of biological motion and the attribution of intention and other mental states share a common neural basis

3. Prediction {\&} Error Learning:
We then observe how well our prediction actually matches the next movement. On the basis of the prediction error we can update our reading of the goal or intention.

‘It' does not look anything like us, but it moves contin- gently to our movements.
Nevertheless, if it is like us deep down, then we can read its intentions from noth- ing but patterns of movements. One idea is that we do this via prediction (Kilner et al. 2007). Given

4. Simulating what "it" knows:
There is now evidence (Samson et al.in press) that we automatically represent the knowledge of others created by their point of view. 

There are few activities more delightful than acquiring some secret information that we can then impart to other people in confidence (Spacks 1982). In contrast, withholding information from others and deliberately deceiving them requires considerable mental effort (Vrij et al. 2006).

False belief task (Wimmer {\&} Perner (1983)):
we can tell where Maxi will look for his chocolate even though it has been moved to a different place when he was not there. In fact, a typical 5 year old can give you a complete explanation when given this test, and if you measure eye movements, then even infants 10–15 months old are surprised if Maxi looks in the wrong place (Onishi {\&} Baillargeon 2005; Surian et al. 2007).

Even adults with autismcannot anticipate with their eye gaze whereMaxi will reach to retrieve the chocolate (Senju et al. 2009). This in sharp contrast to normally developing children and adults.

Motor and emotional imitation / mimicry:
Appears to be instrinsically rewarding

Obviously, motor imitation is not always appropriate for successful interactions. For successful joint action the most important requirement is a common goal. To achieve this requires that most actions should be complementary rather than identical (Sebanz et al. 2006)

Further, when pairs of subjects perform complementary tasks, each covertly rep- resents the task requirements of the other.

Mirror neurons have yet to be definitively identified
in humans (Dinstein et al. 2008; but see Kilner et al. 2009). However, there is plenty of evidence for resonance behaviour in humans at the behavioural and the physiological level.




DELIBERATE SOCIAL SIGNALS:
You need to recognize that the creature wants you to attend to it. Signals that attract your attention are called ostensive. They carry with them the promise that the receiver shall gain some benefit from attending to the message (Sperber {\&}Wilson 1995).

An ostensive gesture could be visually minimal but attentionally highly conspicuous, such as the eyebrow flash (Eibl- Eibesfeldt 1972). 

Once a sender has initiated communication, for instance by using the eyebrow flash, then you, the receiver, will be trying to infer what the sender intends you to understand.

the special kind of representation that closes the loop between minds (Amodio {\&} Frith 2006).

Ostensive gestures in different modalities (eye contact and calling your name, without a message following these signals) elicit activity in arMPFC (Kampe et al. 2003).

"CLOSING THE LOOP" (Frith 2007) between two (or more) individuals via ostensive signals that direct attention towards certain information... 
the process of reducing degrees of freedom in an interaction by sharing knowledge back and forth in order to reach consensus.

Relationship between mentalising and closing the loop:
A good way to approach this question is to study the behaviour of partners in competitive games in the lab- oratory. Here, it is not only important to predict what a partner will do next but also what a partner expects us to do next. Hampton
Influence: involves tracking the influence of one's own actions on one's opponent. They contrast this strategy with two less sophisticated strategies: one, predicting what the opponent will do next based on the opponent's prior actions; the other, predicting which action is most likely to win based on one's own past experience.

A real problem for social interactions is how to get back to a state of cooperation once mutual trust has been lost. We suggest that, here too, deliberate signalling has a critical role.

It appears that evolution has biased humans to behave in a prosocial and cooperative manner. This seems to be our default mode of behav- iour when we are not thinking very deeply about what we are doing (Frith {\&} Frith 2008a).

But what happens when things go wrong? Van Lange et al. (2002) examined what happened when noise was introduced into a trust game. In the game you are asked to invest money in your partner, but the amount you invest is randomly altered. As a result, your partner might receive a smaller than expected investment. This could easily lead to a breakdown in trust if your partner blames you rather than the system and returns with an even smaller investment.

the simple tit-for-tat strategy no longer maintained cooperation. However, cooperation could be maintained if a partner behaved somewhat more cooperatively than the actor did in the previous interaction (i.e. tit-for-tat plus one). 

Forgiving behaviour was also observed by King-Casas et al. (2008) in a study where the break- down of cooperation was caused by the abnormal behaviour of participants with borderline personality disorder, playing with healthy partners.


The function of deliberate signaling: 
then we speculate that such paradigms can become tools to probe potential sources of misunderstanding.

For example, you can sense when a prediction error has occurred by monitoring not simply what is being said, but why in this form rather than another, and you do this automatically as you engage in ostensive communication (Sperber {\&} Wilson 1995).

If my partner in trading pays me back more than I have invested in him, this is not rational. So, I need another interpretation of his behaviour. I infer that this is more than an econ- omic exchange. Rather it is a deliberate signal asking me to trust him, as he trusts me.

@article{Smaldino2015,
abstract = {Human sociality depends upon the benefits of mutual aid and extensive communication. However mutual aid is made difficult by the problems of coordinating diverse norms and preferences, and communication is harried by substantial ambiguity in meaning. Here we demonstrate that these two facts can work together to allow cooperation to develop, by the strategic use of deliberately ambiguous signals, covert signaling. Covert signaling is the transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling, such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics. We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess the conditions under which a covert signaling strategy will be favored. We show that covert signaling plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar individuals when possible and to get along with dissimilar individuals when necessary. This mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation, humor, social identity, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.},

abstract = {Prosocial reputations play an important role, from the evolution of language to Internet transactions; however, questions remain about their behavioural correlates and dynamics. Formal models assume prosocial reputations correlate with the number of cooperative acts one performs; however, if reputations flow through information networks, then the number of individuals one assists may be a better proxy. Formal models demonstrate indirect experience must track behaviour with the same fidelity as direct experience for reputations to become viable; however, research on corporate reputations suggests performance change does not always affect reputation change. Debate exists over the cognitive mechanisms employed for assessing reputation dynamics. Image scoring suggests reputations fluctuate relative to the number of times one fails to assist others in need, while standing strategy claims reputations fluctuate relative to the number of times one fails to assist others in good standing. This study examines the behavioural correlates of prosocial reputations and their dynamics over a 20-month period in an Afro-Caribbean village. Analyses suggest prosocial reputations: (i) are correlated with the number of individuals one assists in economic production, not the number of cooperative acts; (ii) track cooperative behaviour, but are anchored across time; and (iii) are captured neither by image scoring nor standing strategy-type mechanisms.},

annote = {relationship between prosocial reputations and cooperation in social dilemmas:
However, humans form reputations in domains other than prosociality, such as economic competency that could affect cooperation.

To date, no research has evaluated the relative effects of multiple reputation domains on cooperation. 

analyse how prosocial and competency reputations affect cooperation in two Latin American communities.

(i) although some behaviours affect both reputation domains simultaneously, each reputation domain has a unique behavioural signature; and 

(ii) competency reputations affect cooperation across a greater number of social contexts compared to prosocial reputations. 

Reputations are a set of beliefs, perceptions and evaluations that individuals within a social group form about other members' behavioural tendencies

Thesebeliefs are generated through direct and indirect experience (e.g. eavesdropping [6,7] and gossip [8])

The latter reduces transaction costs associated with social interaction by providing individuals with information about others' behavioural propensities without the cost of direct experience, thereby increasing the number of individuals withwhomone can cooperate

Reputational beliefs come in twovarieties: 
(i) beliefs about others (answering the question: ‘what do I think of individual X?') and 

(ii) beliefs aboutwhat others think of the self (answering the question: ‘what do otherpeople thinkofme?') [4,14].

While the former facilitates ego's decision-making regarding social partner choice, the latter regulates ego's behaviour relative to the presence of an audience (i.e. impressionmanagement) [15,16]

LITERATURE:
the role of other-regarding beliefs, specifically prosocial- ity, in the evolution and stability of cooperation in social dilemmas (i.e. situationswhere short-termindividual self-interest is in conflictwith long-term group interests)

1. Indirect Reciprocity [1,18,19,28–31] and 

2. Market Models, which include competitive altruism [21,23,32–35], biological market theory [36–39] and costly signalling theory [10,12,40–46].

Both sets of models assume that actors have preferences for prosocial individuals, in differnet ways:

1. While indirect reciprocity models emphasize the role that prosocial reputa- tions play in the evolution of cooperation in randomly paired, non-repeated interactions,

2. market models emphasize how prosocial reputa- tions, partner choice and the size of the marketplace affect partnership formation, the level of investment in repeated and non-repeated encounters, and the stability of cooperation

1. indirect reciprocity models assume that cooperative behaviour is strategic and reputations represent moral assess- ments about previous behaviour [47], while

2. market models assume that cooperative behaviour is quality-dependent and reputations represent beliefs about underlying quality [10,32,36,48].
market models provide a useful framework for describing pat- terns of social exchange in small populations where both reputations and repeated interactions exist simultaneously [47]

Human communities form reputa- tional judgements across a number of domains, including aggression, leadership and skill [11,13]. Can reputation domains other than prosociality affect cooperation?

economic competency (e.g. skill or effort) [10–12,49–52]

Under prestige-biased transmission, highly skilled individuals, who are valued for their knowledge and expertise, are sought out by those who wish to acquire ecologically relevant knowledge and skills

To curry the favour of competent individuals, naive learners may provide a variety of benefits to skilled indi- viduals, including labour, services or companionship


The cost that naive learners arewillingtopayforaccess toskilledindivid- uals in such a prestige market depends on a variety of factors, including the number of skilled individuals available, the level of skill variability betweenmodels, the number of naive learners willing to compete foraccess to skilled individuals, andwhether social learning represents a zero-sum game [11,36–38,53].

All things equal, prestige-biased transmission processes should result in naive actors who seek out and provide benefits to skilled individuals in an effort to increase competency

Economically competent individualshave a greater ability to produce strategic resources relative to less competent individuals.

These resources can be used to provision others directly (facilitating partnership formation or maintenance) and also signal one's underlying quality, which can lead to alliance formation, deference and mating opportunities

Cross-cultural research demonstrates that economically competent males achieve more marriage partners and/or more extra-pair copulations, havemore community influence, and larger politi- cal and social support networks compared to less competent men [10,13,49,52,55,56].

However, if productivity and generos- ity are correlated, as is found in many small-scale societies [53,57], it could be that generosity, rather than competency, is the valued trait that others use for partnership formation [10,56]

Barclay [58] demonstrates that females prefer altruisticmales for romantic partnerships relative to stingy ones,while a number of studies showthat individuals with better prosocial reputations have larger social support

networks and receivemore labour and monetary rewards com- pared to low prosocial individuals

Without controlling for the shared variance between compe- tency and generosity, it is unclear whether one reputation, the other, or both are salient for partnership formation.

we examine prosocial giving and economic competency reputations in two rural, LatinAmerican commu- nities (Bwa Mawego, Dominica, and Pucucanchita, Peru). Our researchwas guided by two general questions: (i) what are the behavioural correlates of prosocial and competency reputa- tions; and (ii) do prosocial or competency reputations better explain variation in cooperative behaviour and the flow of benefits in ethnographically relevant social contexts? 

first outline the organizational structure of cooperation in specific domains of socio-economic life (Dominica: labour contracting, labour exchange and conju- gal partnership formation; Peru: agricultural and health advice network size). 

Second, we examine the behavioural correlates of prosocial and competency reputations within these econo- mic domains. 

Third, we consider the impact that different reputation domains have on cooperation.

COLLECTIVE ACTION: BAY OIL HARVESTING
bay oil production can require cooperation at two stages: (i) labour contracting—where landowners partnerwith individ- ual communitymembers tomanage plots of land and distil bay oil; and
(ii) bay oil distillation—where community members assist CFADs. 

Whereas labour contracting represents a patron–client relationship and therefore a principal–agent dilemma,

Bay oil distillation is best typified as an N-player, sequential, iterated, mutual aid game. 

In conjunction with our research focus, we probe two questions: 
(i) what are the behavioural determinants of prosocial and economic competency reputations relative to bay oil production; and 
(ii) how do prosocial and economic competency reputations affect cooperation and the flow of benefits?


Owing to the village's small size and the highly conspicuous nature of the task, people realize when they should provide assistance; however, a temptation to shirk one's reciprocal labour obligations is always present. Village members who do not owe labour may opt to assist a CFAD if they seek a new labour partnership

The more labour a CFAD receives, the easier the process; as such, an economy of scale is present with median group sizes equal to three individuals [23] (S.J.M. 2010, unpublished thesis)

METHODS:
One village resident and S.J.M. performed daily instantaneous scan samples of the village's eight distilleries over a 20-month period (1 July 2008 to 1 March 2010) divided into two 10-month time periods (the amount of time for bay trees to re-generate sufficient leaves for harvest; hereafter, T1 and T2, respectively)

Reputations for labour competency and prosociality were
assessed using peer-rated pile sort tasks near themidpoint between the twotime periods.This allowsus todetermine: (i) the effect of be- haviour during the first 10-month time period on reputation formation, and (ii) the effect of reputations on cooperation and the flow of benefits in the second 10-month time period

In June 2009, S.J.M. askedfour communitymembers (twomalesandtwofemales) to rate the 53 men on their bay oil distillation labour competency
using an emically derived five-point ordinal scale (1 = least compe- tent; 5 = most competent)

The task required raters to place 53 cards, each of which contained the name of an individual male, into one of the five categories.

In July 2009, a field assistant asked four community members (two males and two females) to rate the same 53 men on their prosocial tendencies:

The task required raters to place the same 53 cards into one of two categories: (i) ego would not provide labour to an another in need; or (ii) ego would provide labour to an alter in need.


RESULTS:

(a) What are the behavioural correlates of reputations in Dominica?
Prosocial reputations are the product of an individual's age and the number of CFADs he assisted in the previous 10months, controlling for
the number of times a man acts as a CFAD

(Younger men and men who help more CFADs
have better prosocial reputations)

labour competency reputations are the product of the number of times an individual acts as a CFAD and the number of CFADs assisted in the previous 10 months.
(Dominican men become recognized for their competency in bay oil distillation by
acting as a CFAD and by assisting other CFADs)

While each reputation has a unique behavioural signature, assisting CFADs simultaneously affects a man's perceived competence and prosociality.

(b) How do multiple reputations differently affect cooperation and the flow of benefits in Dominica?

Bay oil production represents a multistage process that can require cooperation at two levels: (i) between landowners (patrons) and CFADs (clients) who form labour contract relationships; and (ii) between CFADs and assistants who form labour exchange relationships. Here, we examine how prosocial and labour competency reputations differently affect cooperation at each stage.

Potentially, landowners/ patrons could seek highly competent individuals, highly pro- social individuals, or both for allocating labour contracts. Whereas a competent male knows how to complete the job successfully, a prosocial man may have the social capital necessary to generate a sufficient labour pool.

A Poisson multiple regression analysis reveals that greater competency leads to a greater number of patrons. 

In fact, for every one unit increase in competency reputation, the incident rate of achieving another patron more than doubles

We predict that competent individuals should also receive more labour contracts: A Poisson multiple regression analysis demonstrates that competent labourers do receive more labour contracts compared to prosocial individuals (not shown); however, the relationship between competency reputations and the number of labour contracts received is fully mediated once the effect of number of landowners/patrons is controlled. 

In summary, the more an individual is perceived as competent, the more landowners/patrons are willing to form labour partnerships with him, and the more labour partnerships an individual forms, the more contracts (and wealth) he receives.

According to the mechanism of prestige-biased transmission, individuals without land or other economic prospects may opt to work for a competent CFAD to learn the process himself in the hope that such labour results in improved skills, a better com- petency reputation and eventually landowners/patrons seeking his services in the future. If this is correct, then repu- tations for labour competency should moderate or mediate the relationship between prosocial reputations and the number of people who assist a CFAD.

CFADswith better prosocial reputations, not competency reputations, attract more assistants per event, even after controllingforwhether the event involved alabourcontractornot (table2).

Whereasmenwhoareregarded as highly competent have more patrons and therefore more labour contracts, men who are regarded as highly prosocial receivemore assistance in bay oil distillation.

Logistic regression shows that Dominican females prefer competent men to prosocial ones for conjugal partnerships. For every unit increase in competency reputation, the odds of being in a conju-
gal relationship increases by a factor of five.

The relationship between competency reputations and conjugal partnership for- mation remains even after controlling for his number of
patrons. 

Thus, females prefer competent men for conjugal partnership formation even after controlling for a primary determinant of wealth.

Pucucanchita, Peru
As such, CA for most agricultural tasks in Pucucanchita are best represented as N-person, iterated, social dilemmas.

The altiplano region of highland Peru is a harsh environment, and the indigenous people of this area have evolved a suite of cultural and biological adaptations to deal with high- altitude stressors, low ecological productivity and a lack of point-of-need healthcare [71–76]

Social support in the formof help with agricultural tasks is
of particular importance for HH production; however, not all HHs have the same degree of access

There are two qualities that are particularly valuable in agricultural network support members:

1. a person should be reliable and provide support in times of need (i.e. prosocial). Inconsistent support from network members can disrupt the delicate timing and coordination involved with critical agricultural events.

2. the person must have a good work ethic, high level of physical fitness and strength, and be knowledgeable (i.e. competent) in order to engage in these labour-intensive tasks.

Locals relymore ontraditionalmedicines thanon treatment
from the local healthcare system. The nearest professional healthcare centre is hours away and the more accessible rural health centres are open sporadically, provide minimal care, and lack electricity and sterile working conditions.

HHs depend greatly on advice about health- related issues from members of their community

(i) How are CA reputations (prosocial and competency) shaped? (ii) Which reputation—prosociality or compe- tency—confers the greater social network benefits in the form of agricultural aid and health advice?

DATA COLLECTION:
Data on investment in CA were collected via participant observation, inter- views and archival data over a two-year period. Investment in CA wasmeasured in total time (hours) contributed by each HH.

Interviews: 
Community memberswere asked to namemembers of their community whowere themost reliable (those who seldommiss a CA task—i.e. prosocial individuals) and, in a second question, were asked who were the most hardworking (those with a strong work ethic, high level of skill, physical fitness and strength—i.e. competent individ- uals) in their community when participating in CA projects. For each set of questions, a free-listing method was used in which adults could name as many people as they wished.

Social network data were collected for agricultural support networks and medical advice networks

First, community members were asked whom they had aided and from whom they had received aid with agricultural tasks 

Second, participants were asked if they had watched or cared for anyone else's animals in the six months prior to the inter- view. 

Finally, participantswere asked towhomthey gave and from whom they received animal husbandry advice during the past tiempo de siembra.

The agricultural support network included directed ties combining all three agricultural social relations described above.

Simply put, the reputation of the HH head determines how the HH is perceived as a whole, as he (and sometimes she) is responsible for decisions regarding agricultural pursuits and CA delegation, and voting and attendance at community meetings.

RESULTS:
Time invested in CA is predictive of reputations for both pro- sociality (i.e. reliability) and competency (i.e. hardworking)

This could be owing to the fact that both reputations have shared variance and time invested in CA is predicting this shared variance. To account for this possibility, we use a multiple linear regression model with bootstrapped confi- dence intervals to explore whether each reputation domain uniquely explains variation in time invested in CA

Analyses suggest that time spent in CAis related to prosocial reputations; however, the relationship between competency reputations and time spent in CA is fully mediated after controlling for pro- social reputations (model


Thus, it appears that time spent in CA predicts prosocial/reliability reputations, while the behavioural correlates of competency are left unresolved

Simple correlation analyses demonstrate that the HH's prosocial and competency reputations are related to their agricultural network size health advice network size and position

In each case, stronger correlations are found between competency reputations and network size and
centrality relative to prosocial reputations

However, we seek to know whether a prosocial, a competency reputation, or both better explain variation in social support outcomes. To answer this question and account for the small sample size, we employ generalized linear models with bootstrapped confidence intervals (five simulations per model) for each network measure. Across all three network measures, a competency reputation, not a prosocial reputation, predicted variation in network size and position (figure 4 and table 5).


DISCUSSION:
Our analyses reveal that: (i) although prosocial and economic competency reputations show unique behavioural signatures, some behaviours affect both reputation domains simultaneously; and (ii) across several domains, reputations for economic competency was a better predictor of cooperation relative to prosocial reputations, despite a focus on the latter in much of the literature.

1. DOMINICA:
Interviews with landowners and CFADs suggest that landowners prefer to contract labour with competent men, as these individuals are perceived as having exceptional skills necessary for completing the job in a timely manner and for leading a crew of workers. Prosocial
Prosocial men, on the other hand, are not recognized as leaders of others, only as helpers to others.

individuals with high prosocial reputations receive more labour andlarger group sizes when they distil oil. Because bay oil distillation has an economy of scale, the process is easier for men with better prosocial reputations.

Although a tempta- tion to shirk one's reciprocal labour obligations is always present, individuals who act on this temptation are likely to be labelled as low quality and reap the ‘benefits' of their myopia—labour supply reduction.

Contrary to expectations generated from prestige-biased transmission processes, the most competent men did not receive help from more people. While labouring for others certainly improves a man's knowl- edge and skill, and therefore his reputation for competency, it seems that it is not necessary to learn from the best to become competent in this context. This suggests that the costs to learn- ing are low or that there is little knowledge differentiation between skilled individuals

Interestingly, one behavioural signal—assisting CFADs—contributed to both reputation domains simultaneously. It is possible that this single act indi- cates multiple types of information (i.e. ‘I am competent and prosocial') or that two classes of individuals exist, each of which are sending a different message (i.e. ‘I am prosocial or competent').

A subset ofmales are regarded as highly prosocial and highly competent. LEADERS?

Consist- ent with marketmodels, the highest quality individuals reaped the most benefits in bay oil production. Furthermore, women prefer men who are competent labourers for conjugal part- nership. Previous research indicates that in the absence of other information, females prefer cooperative to uncooperative males and competent to non-competent men. Our results suggest that when females have access to two kinds of reputa- tional information, competent, but not prosocial, males are preferred for conjugal partnerships.

Additionally, we find that age had a negative relationship with prosocial reputations},

annote = {INTRODUCTION
Successful collective action is often attributed to effective leadership. We define leaders as individuals accorded differential influence within a group over the establishment of goals, logistics of coordination, monitoring of effort, or reward and punishment [1]. Leadership has received increasing attention in evolutionary models of human collective action [2–5], but their application to collective action in the field has been rare.

Our focus is on small-scale societies, where the scales of collective action are more representative of human evolutionary history, and most leader–follower interactions are ad hoc and occur in face-to-face contexts. 

We argue that inter-individual differences, such as differences in body size or social connections, reduce costs for leaders and increase the efficacy of leadership.

We then explore how leadership within small-scale societies can become less ad hoc and more institutional, where leader- ship is formally recognized by the community rather than negotiated with each collective action.

We identify increasing wealth inequality, population density and intragroup conflict as sources of institutional leadership. Increasing wealth inequality and population density can provoke greater intragroup conflict, of a severity and frequency that threatens group integrity and places high personal costs on mediators.

Under these conditions, institutional leadership can increase the likelihood of successfully resolving within-group conflicts. We provide qualitative and quantitative data from two small- scale societies, the forager-horticulturalist Tsimane of lowland Bolivia and the nomadic pastoral Nyangatom of Ethiopia and South Sudan, to support these hypotheses.

COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM:
They occur when one or more individuals incur costs to produce a collective good, which can be used by others, including ‘free-riders' who did not contribute to its production


As it is individually advantageous to refrain from contributing to collective action while others contribute towards producing the collective good, free-riding has the potential to undermine collective action. This situation is called a collective action problem [7]. The production of col- lective goods does not always present collective action problems. In some cases, group members are equally motiv- ated to contribute but are unsure how to coordinate their efforts, which can lead to coordination failure

Relative to other primates, humans are astonishingly adept at recognizing opportunities for mutual benefit [16], engaging in joint attention to communicate and act upon these opportunities [17] and solving collective action problems that arise.

LEADERSHIP:
leadership creates ‘second-order' collective action problemswhen leaders experience opportunity costs, risk reta- liation and expendmore effort than other groupmembers,who benefit from the disproportionate contribution of leaders to collective goods [1]

Collective action often involves leaders, who have a larger role than other group members in the establishment of goals, logistics of coordination, monitoring of effort, dispute resol- ution, or reward and punishment. 

When leadership is ascribed, it also tends to be concentrated, to carry coercive power, and to be institutional, though these aspects of leadership do not necessarily have to covary

Task group experiments show that lea- dership emerges spontaneously and rapidly [44] and can improve group performance by facilitating the development of goals and an action plan [45].

Leader-based monitoring and sanctioning may reduce free-riding, by offering a clearer accounting of contribution levels, improving the efficiency of reward or punishment allocation and by limiting retaliatory actions among group members [16]

Results from public goods games indicate that a single punisher can improve group profits relative to an all punish condition [46], and leader-determined shares can improve team earnings relative to equal revenue sharing [47] even when equal revenue sharing is preceded by pre-play communication [48].

Leaders may increase contributions simply by setting a good example [3]. For example, in public goods games with sequential contributions, generous individuals who contribute first increase group contributions from others [49–51].

LEADERSHIP Is more efficient that egalitarianism??

How does this interact with group size??

Leadership may not improve collective action problems in
all contexts.
When the costs to monitoring and sanctioning are minimal and group size is small, leadership may be inefficient relative to mutual monitoring and sanctioning [4]

[4]. Leadership can undermine cooperation if it is considered illegitimate or provokes fear of abuse of power, status envy or greater compe- tition for rank [52]. Legitimacy means leaders have received collective approval [53].

LEADERSHIP must be legitimate

Legitimacy also depends on the process by which leaders obtain their position. In a public goods game played with rural Ugandan farmers, elected leaders elicited greater contributions from group members than randomly appointed leaders [55].

Non-HUMAN LEADERSHIP
First-movers: individuals have greater incentive to move due to energetic demands [56], privileged information [57,58] or dominance [59], which enables differential exploitation of new resource patches [60,61].

Personality: differences such as boldness are also associated with ‘first-movers' independent of the immediate costs and benefits to leadership [62,63].

Leadership is ubiquitous across human societies, even in small-scale societies where egalitarian norms limit status differentials or coercive authority [1].

LEADERSHIP IN SMALL SCALE HUMAN SOCIETIES:

Situational leadership (when moving camp etc)

Small-scale Societies with larger more permanent settlements tend to have leadership that is more institutional, coercive and ascribed [75,76]. 

Two principal forces may affect the emergence of institutional leadership [77]. 

1. Access to monopolizable material wealth. Where resources are heterogeneously distributed, profitable resource patches can be defended by advantaged individuals or kin groups [78]. This privatization of resource patches potentiates patron–client systems [79,80]. Clients accept their subordinate economic position due to disincentives to dispersal, including lower concentration of productive habitat else- where and social (e.g. unfriendly neighbouring groups) or environmental (e.g. mountains, ocean, desert) barriers [81,82].

Across human societies in general, the more that defensible material wealth determines production, the greater the political disparities [86].

2. The difficulty of collective action. 

Group Size:
Collective action problems become more frequent and difficult to solve as group size increases [7,87] In larger, dense communities, the costs of monitoring for free-riding increase, and conflicts between group members tend to become more frequent [88,89]. ---{\textgreater} Institutional leadership

For example, when Arapaho Indian bands agglomerated during the summer buffalo hunt, they elected a tribal chief to oversee production and to police crime; at other times of the year, bands were for the most part acephalous [71].

Institutional leadership can reduce the trans- action costs of cooperation by homogenizing behaviour and social learning critical to coordination [92], streamlining decision-making [89], standardizing punishment and reward, and, perhaps most importantly, generating an apriori commitment of group members to leaders and their decisions.

Rarely is leadership in pre-state societies completely ascribed based on heredity; succession is generally subject to approval [93,94]. In addition, leaders' offspring often acquired the privileged skill and social contacts that gave their fathers their power [95–97], blurring the line between leadership that is achieved versus ascribed
(Social and technical competence is crucial).

Leadership is a solution to collective action problems, but it is also a collective action problem in itself: leaders incur costs that others do not.


individuals with greater physical strength or coalitional support can mediate disputes or coordinate punishment with less risk of retaliation, less effort, and with greater efficacy [1,100].

Even where group members are equally motivated, greater strength or coalitional support on the part of leaders may reduce the effort and time required to solicit the joint attention of group members and to generate consensus regarding an action plan [1]. 

Greater task-specific knowledge, which often covaries with age [105], can increase the efficiency of leader decision-making and followers' com- mitment to leaders' suggestions. 

Older individuals may also have more wisdom, which can be defined as general knowledge regarding interpersonal dilemmas and an ability to make appropriate judgements in the face of uncertainty [106]. 

In general, a motivation to pursue and compete for leadership is contingent on possession of traits that lower the costs and increase the efficacy of leadership [107].

Lower costs arenot sufficient to stabilize leadershipif leaders benefit no more than other group members from collective action.

Finally, effective leadership may serve as a costly signal of quality or cooperative intent, which motivates community members to reward leaders with sex, alliance or deference because of the information these costly signals convey [27］。

CASE STUDY:
we evaluate leadership during group food production (Tsimane), inter- group conflict (Nyangatom) and intragroup conflict resolution (Tsimane and Nyangatom).

We test whether leaders in these contexts are older than most men and have more capital in the form of body size or social connections, and we describe when the Tsimane and Nyangatom rely on more institutional as opposed to informal leadership.},

abstract = {Models of collective action infrequently account for differences across individuals beyond a limited set of strategies, ignoring variation in endowment (e.g. physical condition, wealth, knowledge, personality, support), individual costs of effort, or expected gains from cooperation. However, behavioural research indicates these inter-individual differences can have significant effects on the dynamics of collective action. The papers contributed to this theme issue evaluate how individual differences affect the propensity to cooperate, and how they can catalyse others' likelihood of cooperation (e.g. via leadership). Many of the papers emphasize the relationship between individual decisions and socio-ecological context, particularly the effect of group size. All together, the papers in this theme issue provide a more complete picture of collective action, by embracing the reality of inter-individual variation and its multiple roles in the success or failure of collective action.},
annote = {inter-individual differences within groups can generate leader–follower relationships that are integral to successful collective action [12–15].

This theme issue investigates a broad range of inter-
individual differences as they relate to the resolution of collective action problems in humans and non-human pri- mates.

Gintis et al. [17] extended Zahavi's ideas on signaling [18] to the context of public goods, in which cooperation is an advertisement of quality to attract better mates and/or allies

Gavrilets [19] reviews and develops models that incorporate Olson's insights. In the con- text of collective actions against ‘nature' (e.g. group foraging) and against other groups (e.g. inter-group warfare), he shows that the largest contributors are those with the largest endow- ment, who anticipate the largest share of the collective good, or who can contribute at least cost.

In some cases, however, the largest contributors end up with smaller net pay-offs. The latter effect, described first for a specific case in Gavrilets {\&} Fortunato [20], appears to be a general property of models with multifarious groups.

Greater inter-individual differences boost contributions when there is weak (but not strong) nonlinearity in the benefits and costs of contribution. These theoretical observations have implications for the current debates on the origins of human egalitarian preferences [21,22] and the effects of within-group inequality on cooperation in human groups at different levels [23–25]

Genes, hormones and personality:
Mutation, selection and developmental processes produce a constant source of individual variation related to cooperative- ness, including personality differences. 

a recent human study found that heritable variation in personality traits related to gregarious sociality is explained in part by heritable variation in physical size and skill [32].

However, these latter effects leavemuch variance unexplained, and the extent to which heritable personality variation is adaptive remains unclear [33].

Dawes et al. [34] test the heritability of cooperativeness in humans in terms of civic engagement, using data from a longitudinal twin study. They assess civic engagement based on voting in elections, volunteering for community ser- vice and contributing to charitable causes, which all involve an incentive to free-ride on the cooperativeness of others.

Civic engagement is moderately heritable in their twin population and correlates with verbal IQ and personality traits related to positive emotionality. Furthermore, they argue that genetic factors largely account for these correlations, which is consistent with models in which variation in co-operativeness results (adaptively or as a by-product) from heritable variation in other traits.


The physiology underlying differences in cooperativeness include endocrine mechanisms. Trumble et al. [35] review shared and derived endocrine mechanisms that facilitate the unique levels of cooperation in primates relative to other vertebrates.

focus on the roles of oxytocin and testosterone in contexts of collective action including pair-bonding, food sharing and territorial defence.

Individual differences in these hormones, in part, reflect different adaptive strategies that affect and are affected by contributions to collective action. 

Schroeder et al. [36] argue that reward and punishment institutions modify the associ- ations between personality traits and contributions to a collective good in humans. In public goods experiments, they show that extraversion is associated with a strategic shift from free-riding to cooperation when punishment is possible.

This follows from the prediction that extraversion reflects variation in sensitivity to social rewards.

They show that agreeableness associates with higher initial contri- butions independent of opportunity for punishment, and contrary to prediction, neuroticism is unassociated with a shift in cooperation in the presence of punishment.

The authors encourage future experiments to simulate the insti- tutions that regulate cooperative behaviour outside the laboratory, and they call for greater attention to how personality and socio-economic background affect partici- pants' decision-making.

ECOLOGY, GROUP SIZE, ANTICIPATED BENEFITS:
individual decisions to participate in collective action are a function of socio-ecology (including group size) and individual differences in efficiency and anticipated benefits of cooperation.

Van Belle {\&} Scarry [37] observed communal defence in wild black howler (Aloutatta pigra) and tufted capuchin mon- keys (Sapajus nigritus). They find that both species rely on assessment of numerical asymmetry in male group size (rather than total group size) when deciding to participate in communal defence.

Participating males can be motivated by mating opportunity in black howlers, though this was not evident in tufted capuchins because many participants were subor- dinates. 

While the tufted capuchins increased participation in communal defence with increasing relative male group size, black howlers increased their participation when male group sizes were equal.

They ascribe this variation to communal defence being structured like a Volunteer's Dilemma, in which the public good is only produced if a minimum number of individuals contribute. Among the vervets they observe, individuals who are most likely to contribute are dominants of either sex, who anticipate greater benefits from communal defence.

HUMANS:
Hooper et al. [39] analyse the size, compo- sition and productivity of foraging groups in two small-scale human societies. They attribute variation in group size and composition to the dependence of collective action on three factors: 1. the sexual division of labour, 
2. the intergenerational division of labour, and 
3. economies of scale in production.

They show that individual decisions to join foraging groups are based on the individual's sex and age-based comparative advantage within the particular foraging activity. 

The authors pro- pose that a general theory of economic group formation (and individual roles within groups) can account for the size and structure of groups in both small- and large-scale societies with substantially greater economies of scale and economic specialization.

Gilby et al. [40] argue that group hunting in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is catalysed by ‘impact hunters' who initiate hunts but do not actively coor- dinate other hunters.

Using long-term data from three populations of wild chimpanzees they show that certain indi- viduals initiate hunts more often than chance, and without them hunting is less likely to occur.

When these impact hun- ters initiate a hunt, they appear to dilute prey defences, which lowers the costs of hunting for other chimpanzees.

Acquiring a reputation for delivering benefits to others (i.e. prestige) is a principalmotivation of human leaders. Individuals compete for prestigious reputations because they gain access to greater social support or mating opportunity, as in competitive altruismmodels [41,42].

Macfarlan{\&}Lyle [43] use ethnographic data from two small-scale societies to evaluate how reputations for prosociality and competency affect social support.

In both societies, a reputation for prosociality is associated with receiv- ing greater help, particularly in contexts of collective labour.

they find that a reputation for compe- tency is more likely to attract cooperative partners than a reputation for prosociality across several contexts. 

One explanation for the importance of competency over prosociality is that highly competent individuals may produce goods at a higher rate orproduce goods of greater quality than less competent butmore prosocial individuals.

Henrich et al. [44] show that a psychology for copying the
prestigious can facilitate collective action. They develop a formal model, in which prestigious leaders act prosocially with some probability, and group members decide whether to cooperate or defect based in part on their propensity to copy the leader.

The emergence and stability of collective action depend on how likely followers are to learn coopera- tive behaviour from leaders, followers' retention of cooperative behaviour over time and the transmission of cooperative behaviour via social learning to subsequent generations.

argue that leaders can facilitate collective action independent of any special role in coordination, monitoring or sanctioning of group members, as a result ofprestige-biased cultural learning.

natural selection can promote even greater prosociality in pres- tigious individuals (though the effects of selection depend on group size).

Henrich et al. [44] suggest that in non-human primates, a relative lack of prestige-biased cultural transmission contributes to an absence of leader-driven collective action.

Glowacki {\&} von Rueden [45] use ethnographic data to argue that leadership in small-scale human societies can solve collective action problems by facilitating coordination and reducing the transaction costs of cooperation. 

Leaders are able to lead because they commonly have a larger endow- ment, such as size, strength, age-related experience or more social connections. They argue that the nature of leadership in small-scale societies provides insights into the origins of socio-political complexity. Leadership in small-scale societies is usually informal and situational. However, leadership becomes more institutional in domains of collective action, such as resolution of intragroup conflict, where collective action failure threatens group integrity.},

annote = {METHOD:
Prior to completing a cold-pressor (CP) task, 80 Chinese and 80 European Canadian undergraduate students were administered mea- sures of pain catastrophizing and pain attitudes, including stoicism and cautiousness.

Pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain intensity were measured during the CP task.

The Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire was administered immediately postimmersion to measure sensory and affective pain.

RESULTS: 

1. While there were no group difference in pain threshold and pain intensity, Chinese participants displayed lower pain tolerance and reported higher SF-MPQ-Affective than European Canadians. 

2. Regarding psychological variables, there was no difference in stoicism and cautiousness between groups, but Chinese participants reported greater pain catastrophizing. 

3. Mediational analysis indicated that pain catastrophizing mediated the group differences in SF-MPQ-Affective score. The implications of the findings and future research were discussed.

INTRO:
Nepalese participants had higher electrical-pain thresh- olds than Europeans, even though both groups are equally sensitive to changes in electric shock.
college students undergoing cold-pressor (CP) pain reported greater tolerances than Euro-American stu- dents.36 South Asians in the UK reported lower pain threshold, higher pain intensity, and higher pain unpleasantness compared to white Europeans.16,57 

Several models of pain (eg, sociocultural model,11,31 biocultural model2) have proposed that psychosocial factors that are associated with culture promote differ- ential pain experience and that psychosocial factors in ethnic pain remains a neglected research area.

Although catastrophizing is one of the most robustly supported psychosocial factors associated with greater pain intensity and emotional distress across both clini- cal and acute pain, it has had relatively little exposure in ethnic research.47,49,54 Moreover,

China:
Chinese society is influenced by Confucianism, which en- courages stoicism.27 Stoicism is a term that refers to re- pression of emotion or indifference to pain, and it is considered a positive trait for the Chinese,38 who believe that the expression of pain is a sign of weakness.

Experimental evidence:
Despite the prevalent view that Chinese may be more emotionally stoic32 and thus may report less pain compared to North Americans,8 the limited evidence suggests the op- posite. 

For example, 
- Knox et al29 compared 12 Chinese and 12 North Americans in responses to cold-pressor pain, with the Chinese reporting greater pain and distress. Similarly, 
- Woodrow et al60 demonstrated that Chinese and Japanese participants had lower pain tolerances than Europeans in an experiment involving mechanical pressure on the Achilles tendon.

3.PAIN CATASTROPHIZING Scale: is a 13-item self-
report measure of pain catastrophizing assessing nega- tive thoughts associated with pain. The PCS measures 3 dimensions of catastrophizing: rumination, magnifica- tion, and helplessness. Participants reflect on past painful experiences and rate their feelings of pain on a 5-point Likert scale (0 ‘‘not at all'', 4 ‘‘all the time''). PCS scores range from 0 to 52, where higher scores indicate more pain catastrophizing.

The Pain Attitudes Questionnaire–Revised (PAQ-R)62 is a 24-item self-report measure for assessing pain-related attitudes such as stoicism and cautiousness. This scale is reliable and valid for the chronic-pain population as well as healthy community-dwelling adults, across different age groups.

Stoicism refers to reluc- tance to express pain and tolerance of pain (eg, go on as if nothing has happened, keep pain to self, can endure more pain than others), whereas cautiousness refers to a lack of confidence in themselves to make judgments of pain sensations or a reluctance to label a sensation as painful (eg, need time to decide, reluctant to label pain).

Pain Threshold 
was determined by asking participants
to raise their dominant hand (ie, the one not immersed in the CP) the moment they began to feel any pain or dis- comfort. The time, in seconds, that passed between the immersion and the raising of the hand was recorded as the pain threshold.

Pain Tolerance
is the total time, in seconds, that the participant's arm was immersed in the water minus his or her pain-threshold time. In the present study, the tol- erance time had an imposed ceiling time of 180 sec- onds,26 which was not revealed to the participants until after the experiment.

Pain Intensity 
Participants rated the intensity of their pain during the
CP task on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). In the present study, an 11-point NRS was used with 0 labeled as ‘‘no pain'' and 10 as ‘‘extreme pain.''

Participants were prompted to rate the intensity of the CP pain after the first 5 seconds, then at 15-second intervals until they re- moved their hand or until they reached the ceiling time. All of the NRS ratings were then averaged for each participant to give a global pain-intensity score.

Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire
The emotional and sensory components of pain were assessed using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).35 This measure consists of 15 descriptors which required participants to reflect on their current pain experience and rank each descriptor on an intensity scale

PROCEDURE 
... Participants were asked to raise their nonimmersed hand as soon as they started feeling any discomfort for threshold recording. Partici- pants were prompted to report their pain rating on a scale of 0 to 10, 5 seconds after immersion in the cold water and every 15 seconds thereafter until the withdrawal of the hand or the ceiling time of 180 seconds.

RESULTS:
1. Lower pain tolerance in Chinese
2. Higher Catastrophizing in Chinese 
3. Higher Affective experience of pain in Chinese
4. Catastrophizing mediates affective experience


Discussion

Researchers have proposed that pain tolerance and suprathreshold ratings of pain unpleasantness reflect affective-motivational aspects of pain, whereas pain- thresholdandsuprathreshold ratings of pain intensity re- flect the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain.23,24,39

Further, it is theo- rized that ethnic differences in pain responses may be most apparent for the affective-motivational dimension of pain because it is more influenced by psychosocial factors than the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain.14,41,44

Catastrophising {\&} relationship to sensory and affective components of pain:

While pain cata- strophizing does predict sensory-based pain reports during cold-pressor tasks,17,47,50 other research shows that catastrophizing correlates more strongly with the qualitative component of pain but less or not at all with the sensory component assessed by threshold and numerical pain-intensity ratings.

For example, studies us- ing cold-pressor tasks have found that pain catastrophiz- ing is not associated with pain threshold, pain tolerance, or pain intensity5,18,19 but is associated with clinical pain reports.

The finding of significant correlations be- tween pain catastrophizing and the SF-MPQ, which rep- resents the qualitative dimension of pain, appear to be consistent with parts of the recent literature regarding catastrophizing

Consequentiality of Pain in Experimental Designs:
An explanation for this is that per- haps the cold pressor pain was not threatening enough to elicit avoidance behavior from pain catastrophizing. Gracely et al21 have suggested that the use of low-threat pain stimuli commonly found in experimental studies may weaken the influence of catastrophizing on pain re- sponse. Other potential contributors to ethnic differences in pain, such as fear of pain or communication and inter- personalfactors,werenotassessedinthis studyandshould be examined in the future.10,18

The present finding suggests that while the Chinese culture (eg, Confucian- ism) emphasizes the inhibition of emotions as an adap- tive coping strategy32 and as a positive trait,38 this attitude may not be generalized to acute pain situations. At least with experimentally induced pain, the stereo- typed view of stoic Asians cannot be generalized to this healthy Chinese university-aged sample. Stoic in what context?? Of course they won't be stoic unless they need to be! Confucian self-construal is one situated in a community of people for whom one is interdependently attached... not a random bunch of university kids you want the {\$}10 cash!?


Catastrophizing:
Within the Communal Coping Model, it is proposed that catastrophizing serves a social communicative function aimed toward maximizing the probability that distress will be managed within a social/in-terpersonal context rather than an individualistic context.20,48 

Eastern cultures, such as the Chinese, emphasize interdependence rather than independence. 58 Individuals within theWestern culture, described as an independent culture, tend to exert greater primary control (ie, engage in active behaviors to change their reality or situation).

On the other hand, interdependent individuals tend to exert greater secondary control by accepting existing circumstances andmodifying psychological effects caused by this situation.43 Since

abstract = {Context: Pain beliefs as indexed by the Survey of Pain Attitudes (SOPA) have been consistently shown to predict pain adjustment outcomes in Western populations. However, its utility in non-Western populations is unclear. Objectives: We evaluated the construct and predictive validity of the Chinese version of the 14-item SOPA (ChSOPA-14) in a sample of Chinese patients with chronic pain. Methods: A total of 208 Chinese patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed the ChSOPA-14, the Chronic Pain Grade questionnaire, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and measures of sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Except Medical Cure, all ChSOPA-14 scales were significantly correlated with validity criterion measures (all P {\textless} 0.05) in expected directions. The present Chinese sample scored the highest on the Medical Cure scale (mean = 2.98, standard deviation [SD] = 1.05) but the lowest on the Disability scale (mean = 1.75, SD = 1.67). Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that the ChSOPA-14 scales predicted concurrent depression (F(7,177) = 14.51, P {\textless} 0.001) and pain disability (F(7,180) = 8.77, P {\textless} 0.001). Pain Control (std?? [standardized beta coefficient] = -0.13; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: -3.41, -0.13; P {\textless} 0.05) and Emotion (std?? = 29; 95{\%} CI: 1.76, 5.02; P {\textless} 0.001) emerged as significant independent predictors of concurrent depression whereas Disability (std?? = 0.19; 95{\%} CI: 1.33, 7.88; P {\textless} 0.01), Emotion (std?? = 16; 95{\%} CI: 0.08, 7.59; P {\textless} 0.05), and Solicitude (std?? = -0.14; 95{\%} CI: -7.05, -0.04; P {\textless} 0.05) significantly associated with concurrent disability. Conclusion: The findings offer preliminary evidence for the construct and concurrent predictive validity of the ChSOPA-14. This makes available a suitable instrument for chronic pain in the Chinese population and will facilitate future cross-cultural research on pain beliefs. ?? 2011 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to describe some of the concepts within the Chinese culture that influence the sociocultural dimension of the cancer pain experience. The major concepts that influence Chinese patients' perspectives on cancer pain and its management include Taoism/energy, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Within the beliefs of Taoism/energy, pain occurs if Qi, or blood circulation, is blocked. To relieve pain, the blockage of Qi/blood must be removed and the person needs to maintain harmony with the universe. Within the beliefs of Buddhism, pain/suffering is a power, unwanted but existent, that comes from a barrier in the last life; from the objective world; from a person's own sensation; or from other people, animals, and materials. Only by following the 8 right ways (ie, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration) can an individual end the path of pain/suffering. A Confucian believes that pain is an essential element of life, a "trial" or a "sacrifice." Therefore, when a person suffers with pain, he or she would rather endure the pain and not report it to a clinician until the pain becomes unbearable. Oncology nurses who care for Chinese patients need to understand the fundamental beliefs that influence the sociocultural dimension of the pain experience for these patients. This information will assist the oncology nurse in developing a more effective pain management plan.},

Buddhism:
pain/suffering is a power, unwanted but existent, that comes from a barrier in the last life; from the objective world; from a person's own sensation; or from other people, animals, and materials

Only by following the 8 right ways (ie, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration) can an individual end the path of pain/suffering.

Confucianism:
A Confucian believes that pain is an essential element of life, a ‘‘trial'' or a ‘‘sacrifice.'' Therefore, when a person suffers with pain, he or she would rather endure the pain and not report it to a clinician until the pain becomes unbearable

Taoism and Qi:
Yuan qi (original energy)
Gu qi (Grain energy - from food etc)
Kong qi (Air energy, from the air we breathe)

Disharmonies of Qi:
1. deficient Qi, may affect the whole person and may cause lethargy, exhaustion, cold, and loss of organ function.

2. collapsed Qi, a kind of deficient Qi, means that the Qi is too insufficient to hold organs in place. It may cause the prolapse of the uterus or hemorrhoids or loss of motivation or commitment. 

3. stagnant Qi, is abnormal Qi movementVthe Qi does not flow through the body in a smooth and orderly fashion. Stagnant Qi in the limbs and meridians may be the origin of aches and pain in the body. It can also lead to the impairment of an organ.

4. rebellious Qi. is a particular disharmony in which the Qi is going in the wrong direction. For example, stomach Qi should be down- ward; if it rebels and goes upward, there may be vomiting and nausea or explosive forms of mania.

Pain is regarded as stagnant Qi in limbs and meridians. Chinese people believed that pain occurs if Qi circulation is blocked. 

On a psychological level, the inability to feel safe, excessive vigilance, suspiciousness, paranoid ideation, and delusion can also be associated with congealed blood.

A Chinese proverb says that ‘‘there is no pain without a blockage and no blockage without pain.'' This phrase means that because every pain is a blockage of Qi/blood, removing the blockage will eliminate the pain. The principals of pain relief are not only to move the blockage of Qi/blood but also to maintain harmony with the universe.


Buddhism: 
Buddhists regard pain (rendered as ill, sorrow, turmoil, and suffering) as a defining characteristic of human life. Pain is a part of life, as well as a physical- emotional-mental-spiritual complex that defines the nature of human existence.

If a person experiences pain calmly, without becoming emotionally distressed, he or she can attain greater states of being.

Pain arises from craving for objects that are figments of distorted human minds. The only way to transcend pain/suffering and to experience a lasting spiritual bliss is through enlightenmentVthe art and joy of the destruction of craving.19 In Buddhism, 8 ways exist to end the path of pain/suffering (Table 2).

(1) the intention of renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of desire; (2) the intention of goodwill, which means resistance to feelings of anger and aversion; and (3) the intention of harmlessness, which means not to think or act cruelly, violently, or aggressively and to develop compassion


Confucianism
The teachings of Confucius are principals for social inter- action, individual morality, and ethics. 

Harmony with all others and a lack of self-centeredness, respect for parents, and loyalty to family are the main teachings of Confucianism

Li 礼 (ritual, propriety), Hsiao 孝 (love of parents for their children and of children for their parents), Yi 义 (righteousness), Chung 忠(loyalty), Xin信 (honesty and trustworthiness), and Jen 仁 (benevolence and humaneness toward others) are the important concepts of Confucianism.

However, to obtain respect from others, one must practice upright behavior, take care of one's own self, keep one's knowledge current, respect and love one's children, and assist with household and family tasks.

A Confucian believes that pain is an essential element of
life. If one loses the sensation of pain, one is no longer human. Pain is the best assurance that people are not really numb and insensitive.28 The experience of pain and suffering not only heightens a person's sensitivity but also reminds a person of his or her humanness.

Mencius, a Confucian thinker, believed that humanness is to share with others one's pain/suffering.

To share the pain or suffering of another is to achieve the goodness of human nature

To take one's own experience of pain near at hand is the departure to understand the minds and hearts of others. If one suffers from pain, one may derive some comfort from sympathetic relatives and friends, but one must bear the burden alone. The Confucian golden rule predicates that you should not do unto others what you would not want others to do unto you.

Pain, like evil, is something that all individuals wish to avoid. Unlike a gospel, which should be spread by missionary zeal, pain should be controlled, confined, managed, and, hopefully, killed.19 Thus, to refrain from imposing pain on others is a minimum requirement for cultivating the good life for everyone.

In the Chinese culture, pain as a ‘‘trial'' or ‘‘sacrifice'' is profoundly meaningful. Therefore, when a person suffers with pain, he or she would rather endure the pain and not report it to a clinician until the pain becomes unbearable. Sometimes, patients will report their pain only to close family members and ask the family members to report the pain to a member of the healthcare team.},

Pressure represents " any factor or combination of factors that increases the importance of performing well on a particular occasion " (Baumeister, 1984, p. 610). Pressure usually triggers stress (e.g., Laborde, Raab, {\&} Kinrade, 2014) and emotions, in particular anxiety (e.g., Laborde, Lautenbach, Allen, Herbert, {\&} Achtzehn, 2014). Hence, pressure has the potential to influence cognitive processes , for example, evidenced in a recent special issue on emotion and decision-making (Laborde, Dosseville, {\&} Raab, 2013). Complementary to this account, neuroscientists made clear that cognition and emotion are embedded (Damasio, 1994), in the sense that effective cognition can only happen with a working functional connection to emotions, which ultimately motivates the investigation of the emotion–cognition dyad in Section E. This introductory chapter to Section E provides the reader with the basics to understand the relevant theories attempting to bridge the gap between emotion and cognition in performance contexts. In it, we will point out the current challenges of the field and offer a critical view on the theories. Finally, we will show how theory development and the pertinent combination of different research methods can help both basic research and the applied field with the development of specific interventions.

annote = {Ethical dissonance is triggered by the inconsistency between the aspiration to uphold a moral self- image and the temptation to benefit from unethical behavior.

Temporal distinction: 
"anticipated dissonance" occurs before people commit a moral-violation. In contrast, 

"experienced dissonance" occurs after people realize they have violated their moral code.

harnessing anticipated-dissonance to help people resist temptation

experienced-dissonance to prompt moral compensation and atonement

1. ethical dissonance involves the breach of absolute criteria of right and wrong (e.g. the Ten Commandments; Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics).

2. Beyond cognitive inconsistency, ethical dissonance poses a larger threat to the self, by including also the violation of social norms and failed self-integrity [6, 7]

3. people cannot solve this dissonance with a change of attitude, as explicit cutback of moral standards will further threat the self-image [5]


REDUCING ANTICIPATED ETHICAL DISSONANCE

- When anticipated ethical dissonance arises, people use pre-violation justifications to redefine unethical behaviors as “non” violations. 

- Ambiguity and grey areas allow people to blur the difference between right and wrong, and diminish the threat to the moral-self [8**]
"quiet down ethical dissonance" (5)

-Cash substitutions: 
coke cans in the fridge instead of dollars; tokens instead of dollar bills

-Shuffling and Stretching the truth: 

-Self-serving altruism:
white lies, altruistic cheating increases as the lie benefits more people Importantly, as the bonds with the beneficiaries are stronger (e.g. friends, family) the anticipated ethical dissonance dissolves and people experience less guilt [16, 17]
oxytocin facilitates self-serving altruism [18]. This hormone strengthen social-bonding and is also associated with decreases in anxiety and social threat [19]

The Robin Hood logic goes one step further and justifies clear unethical behavior if it hurts the ‘strong' to benefit the ‘weak'. In a field study researchers examined vehicle emissions testing, and found that inspectors were more likely to pass standard (“poor looking”) cars that should have failed the test, but were stricter with regard to luxury vehicles [20].

LICENSING: previous good deeds balance a mental moral sheet and reduce the anticipated threat to the moral-self. 
expressing support for a Black political candidate licensed participants to discriminate against Black people in subsequent hiring decisions

choosing to buy green products made participants more likely to engage later in dishonest behavior [21]

Recalling pro-social behavior from their past led people to make lower donations and justify unethical corporate decisions

REDUCING EXPERIENCED ETHICAL DISSONANCE
use post-violation justifications to compensate for their guilt and reestablish their moral self 

CLEANSING:
One way to relieve guilt involves self-punishment and physical pain

Similar to religious rituals (e.g. fasting, abstinence, or flagellation) studies indicate that participants responded to their own moral violation with a tendency to self-inflict pain [32]

guilty participants immersed their hand in ice-water for longer time [35]

pain reduced participants' feeling of guilt 
(Tangney et al. 2007)

and greater pain led to greater emotional relief (Inbar et al. 2013)

along the lines of religious rituals (e.g. baptism for repentance) there is evidence for an association between physical cleansing and moral purification [36] . 

evidence for an association between physical cleansing and moral purification
(Bastian et al. 2011)

association between physical cleansing and moral purification (Schnall et al. 2008)

after participants hand-copied a description of unethical selfish behavior they preferred a gift of an antiseptic wipe over a pencil; participants who used the antiseptic wipe to clean their hands experienced fewer moral emotions (such as guilt) than those who did not use the wipe (Zhong {\&} Liljenquist 2006)

CONFESSION: 
merely informing participants they would later simulate confession was enough to reduce dishonest behavior (Ayal {\&} GIno 2012).

Recent work suggests that people sometimes engage in partial confession, where they admit some wrongdoing to restore their sense of morality but hide the full extent of their actions to avoid embarrassment and shame (Acquisti {\&} Shalvi 2014).

DISTANCING:
hiding one's own moral violation while pointing to other people's moral failings

recalled a moral violation they could not deny and truly regretted (control conditions included negative events, personal disappointments or neutral events). Only the first group experienced ethical dissonance

presented an ultra-honest image, adopted stricter ethical criteria, and judged other people's
unethical behavior more harshly (Barkan et al. 2012) (The pot calling the kettle black).

When wrongdoers are identified as out-group members, distancing is emphasized, leading to explicit condemnation (Gino et al. 2009).

MORAL HYPOCRISY:
A cynical post-violation justification allows people to hold two distinct belief systems

Machiavelli's logic in The Prince: moral hypocrisy asserts that power and status justify immoral behavior as means to an end or as privilege

power and status trumps morality
(Monin {\&} Merritt 2011; Rustichini {\&} Villeval 2014; Valdesolo {\&} DeSteno 2007)


dictator game or manager-employee simulation, they changed their perceptions of fairness and morality, judged their own violations leniently and judged the violations of others harshly

CONCLUSIONS:
A robust finding indicates that people wish to be moral and consider honesty central to their self-image [44].

Presenting a picture of eyes above an honor- pay-jar lowered the sense of anonymity and resulted in more payments [45]. 

Signing Signing one's name at the top of an insurance form (rather than at the bottom) elicited moral commitment and reduced false reports [46*] 

and forcing delays between choice and implementation encouraged self-reflection and helped people resist temporary temptations [48, 49].

JUSTIFICATIONS: While justifications protect people from psychological tension and secure their self- image they also allow people to behave unethically, making their sense of morality a mirage.

Our review portrays a moral pendulum [23] which allows people to swing back and forth between the guilt associated with unethical temptation and a sense of decency elicited by justifications (Zhong et al. 2009).},

‘‘placebo effect'' or ‘‘placebo response'' stood for an improvement of the patient's clinical state caused by a physiologically inert treatment (Benedetti, 2014)

not the inert treatment itself, but rather the meaning that it has for the patient, which causes the effect (Moerman, 2013; Moerman {\&} Jonas, 2002)

but also includes other psychosocial aspects of the medical environ- ment, such as care and a positive doctor–patient relationship (Benedetti, 2013; Hart {\&} Dieppe, 1996; Kelley, Kraft-Todd, Schapira, Kossowsky, {\&} Riess, 2014)

BELIEF, meaning, interpersonal


Powerful but scope limited to pain/immune response? IIt can't cure the disease, it can only REDUCE the severity of SYMPTOMS!

QUESTION: why social support and physiologically inert treatments have an impact on these symptoms (Miller et al., 2009).

symptoms are exaggerated to heighten the likelihood of mobilizing help and treatment. Once help and treatment are received, this signaling function is fulfilled and the symptoms can diminish

EVO Background:
research is rather interested in the proximate mechan- ism of the placebo effect, specifically in how it is mediated physiologically (Benedetti, 2013)

research in this field has yet to answer questions concerning the function which this mechanism fulfills and, hence, why such a mechanism exists (Miller et al., 2009).

PAIN (Wall 1999): alarm {\&} action response system...

the placebo effect can be seen as one small aspect of this adaptation, ‘‘[ ... ] the placebo is not a stimulus but an appro- priate action'' (Wall, 1999, p. 155).

HUMPHREY SCHOOL of PLACEBO
Self-healing and defense should not be an automatic reaction to infection and injury. Rather, they should be employed selectively after a cost–benefit analysis: 

the regulation of self-healing should be based on a calcu- lation of costs, opportunity costs, and potential benefits. This calculation is based on the individual's subjective judgment of environmental conditions, that is, in the terminology of placebo research, on expectations.

EVANS SCHOOL
disagrees with Humphrey's thesis, claiming
that the placebo effect is not concerned with enhancing immune activity but rather with suppressing it. Evans observes that the placebo-responsive conditions, such as pain, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome have something in common: They are each symptoms of an acute-phase response or at least closely related to it.

Evans regards the placebo effect as a special case of the broad phenomenon of immune conditioning:

immune reac- tions are up or down regulated, depending on environmental factors and previous experience

Evans finds more empirical evidence for conditioned immune suppression than for conditioned immune enhancement. Therefore, he suggests that immune conditioning might have evolved as a ‘‘[ ... ]protective mechanism, to save the immune system from unnecessary expenditure

and not as a general-purpose learning mechanism to enable the immune system to respond in any way to any psychological input'' (Evans, 2003, p. 105)

why the placebo effect is restricted to symptoms of the acute-phase response. Evans speculates that in some situations, it might be adaptive to suppress the acute-phase response in order to allow an earlier onset of the adaptive immune response

The risk of injury and infection has been a crucial adaptive problem throughout evolutionary history, and the immune sys- tem developed as its adaptive answer (Nesse{\&}Williams, 1995)

However, an immune reaction also has substantial costs:
- direct costs, such as higher energy consump- tion or potential tissue damage due to high fever
- there are opportunity costs. Immune system activation is associated with so-called sickness behavior such as sleepiness, apathy, and social withdrawal, reflecting a motivational shift away from social, sexual, and aggressive behavior that allows maximization of immune activity (Aubert, 1999; Dantzer {\&} Kelley, 2007; Hart, 1988) 

SOCIAL COSTS:
sick animals miss out on opportunities for mating, bonding, and fighting for places in dominance hierarchies. Fur- ther, avoidant behavior of conspecifics may contribute to these social costs (Avitsur, Cohen,{\&}Yirmiya, 1997)

In certain situa- tions, opportunity costs are so high that the immune response is suppressed in order to enable normal behavior

male zebra finches whose immune systems were artificially provoked, display symptoms of illnesswhenthey are housed in a single cage, butwhenhoused in a group cage, they do not display these symptoms (Lopes et al., 2012)

when sick male zebra finches are in the presence of a female zebra finch, their symptoms vanish, presumably to enable mating (Lopes et al., 2013)

in some species the opportunity costs of an
immune system are partly compensated by support of conspecifics

When the female shows symptoms of sick- ness, the male sparrow collects more food to compensate for her absence (Bonneaud et al., 2003).

Hart (1990, 2011): Female chimpanzees reduced their travel speed to let a sick group member keep pace
took care of the sick mother's son while she was sleeping.
of wild mongooses, an injured group member was extensively groomed and even provided with food

While provision of food to sick group members is observed only in some nonhuman animals, mutual support in case of sickness or injury is a crucial part of life in human hunter-gatherer societies and, moreover, some have conjectured that this social support is one of the reasons for human longevity (Gurven, Stieglitz, Hooper, Gomes, {\&} Kaplan, 2012; Sugiyama, 2004)

In contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, injuries and sicknesses that temporarily keep a group member from gathering and hunting are common (Gurven, Allen-Arave, Hill, {\&} Hurtado, 2000; Hagen, Hames, Craig, Lauer, {\&} Price, 2003; Hill {\&} Hurtado, 2009; Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama {\&} Chacon, 2000)

Sick and injured group members are provided with food (Gurven et al., 2000; Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama {\&} Chacon, 2000), notably, without the possibility of direct reciprocity from the sick person (Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama {\&} Chacon, 2000; Tooby {\&} Cosmides, 1996).

The altruistic act of sharing food might be explained through delayed reciprocity or improved reputation on the part of the donor (Hawkes, 1991; Nesse, 2007; Sugiyama {\&} Chacon, 2000; Tooby {\&} Cosmides, 1996).

helping can be an honest signal of mate quality and worthiness as a cooperation partner (Barclay, 2012, 2013; Barclay {\&} Willer, 2007; Fehrler {\&} Przepiorka, 2013; Gintis, Smith, {\&} Bowles, 2001; McAndrew {\&} Perilloux, 2012; Sylwester {\&} Roberts, 2013).

group members who distributed more food when in a healthy condition receive more support when they are sick (Gurven et al., 2000; Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama {\&} Chacon, 2000).

Medical Treatments Neanderthals

medical treatments since the time of homo neanderthalensis. There is a wide range of effective herbal medicines and it is possible that some of these might have been in use in ancient hunter-gatherer societies (Halberstein, 2005)

Flowers found in a Neanderthal grave have remarkable medical efficacy and might have been chosen as a funerary object on this basis (Lietava, 1992)

red ochre is well-documented among Nean- derthals across Europe (Roebroeks et al., 2012)

Symptoms as Cues:
Accordingly, what we perceive as a sickness in everyday life is not the presence of an infection itself but the easily discernible symptoms, such as pain, fever, cough, sneezing, shivering, loss of appetite, and so on

part of the body's response to the infection

an immune reaction not only fulfills the function of a defense against infections but also, as a bypro- duct, produces discernible symptoms that inform other group members about the need for help and treatment.

Thornhill and Thornhill (1989) suggest that psy- chological pain has a dual function. On the one hand, psycho- logical pain drives the individual's attention to the source of pain, motivates introspective analysis and, in this way, might lead to a solution. On the other hand, psychological pain serves as a social display of need

Wall regards pain as a need state that drives the sufferer's attention to a possible solution. At the same time, without elaborating on it, Wall makes it clear that pain has two sides: ‘‘private pain and public display'' (Wall, 1999, p. 1).

the discernible symptoms of an immune reaction form part of the immune system, that is, a complex set of adaptations for the function of defense, but the discernible symptoms are also an exaptation with the effect of mobilizing help.

[The symptoms are now also signals, since they are shaped by evolution for a communicative purpose.] question this

stronger symptoms provide more convincing
signals than weaker symptoms. Thus, higher fever, stronger appearance of pain, louder sneezing and coughing, worse ane- mia, more obvious nausea, and so on should mobilize the most social support.

Thus, symptoms should be exaggerated above the level that is optimal for defense to improve the chances of receiving social support.

The two functions result in a trade-off. Optimal signaling means subopti- mal defense,while optimal defense means suboptimal signaling

The double function of discernible symptoms is based on an evolutionary path dependency: a con- straint in the terminology of evolutionary medicine (Nesse, 2005; Nesse {\&} Williams, 1995; Williams {\&} Nesse, 1991).

Costly / Honest Signaling:
the symptom signals are quite dif- ficult to fake, since they are highly costly for the sender. 

Discernible symptoms like fever are costly in terms of energy

Second, the symptoms not only harm the pathogens but also the body itself (Eraud et al., 2009; LeGrand {\&} Alcock, 2012).

Third, being sick has opportunity costs which arise from typical sickness behavior: fatigue, lack of sexual interest, and loss of appetite (Dantzer {\&} Kelley, 2007; Hart, 1988)

In short, transmitting convincing signals of sickness is highly costly and likely only pays off for those who are really in need of help, not for those who only aim to take time off on full board

Disgust, pathogen avoidance, and the behavioral immune system:
so sensitive that it not only reacts to contagious conspecifics but also to noncontagious deviations from the norm, such as facial disfig- urements, overweightness, old age, and physical disabilities (Duncan

First, disgust and avoidance are weaker when considering familiar people and in-group mem- bers, as compared to out-group members and strangers (Case, Repacholi, {\&} Stevenson, 2006; Curtis et al., 2004; Peng, Chang, {\&} Zhou, 2013).

strangers are more likely to carry novel pathogens for which the immune system is not yet pre- pared (Fincher

the fast automatic reaction of avoidance can be overridden by a slow, controlled, and rule-based process that takes into account social norms and social pressure (Kleck, 1969; Kleck, Ono, {\&} Hastorf, 1966; Pryor, Reeder, Yeadon, {\&} Hesson-McInnis, 2004; Stone {\&} Potton, 2014).

One of these social norms might be to help sick group members (Schaller, 2011). Also, helping the sick might be rewarded with especially high social prestige (Schaller, 2011).

As soon as the status of sickness is acknowl- edged by the group, once support and treatment is granted, the signaling function is fulfilled and the immune reaction can diminish

But how does an individual judge (consciously or unconsciously) whether it has been supported and treated properly and, in this way, whether the signaling function of the immune system has been fulfilled?

Stone Age Medical Treatment:
so any kind of treatment was done by people and always involved social contact with famil- iar group members. Second, just like any other part of culture, medication and rituals of treatment probably changed over time and differed between groups...so humans were selected for flexible treatment demands depending on the respective medical culture

As there was no effective treatment without extensive personal care, humans should have a universal need for personal care in case of sickness

On the one hand, there should be a general response to social support. On the other hand, there should be a rather open response, based on the beliefs of effectiveness of the sick person, shaped by the respective cultural environment.

Precisely these two factors—a general response to social support and an open response based on individual beliefs of effectiveness—can be found in empirical studies of the placebo effect. 

Two factors trigger the placebo effect: on the one hand, care and social support (Benedetti, 2013; Kelley et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2009) and, on the other, the patient's expectation of amelioration (Benedetti et al., 2003; Stewart-Williams {\&} Podd, 2004).

In a much more recent study, intranasal administration of oxytocin has been shown to increase the analgesic effect of a placebo oint- ment applied to the forearm (Kessner, Sprenger, Wrobel, Wiech, {\&} Bingel, 2013). Oxytocin increases trust (Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher,{\&}Fehr, 2005), and in this case it probably raised the subject's trust in the doctor applying the placebo ointment (Kessner et al., 2013)

Still, there seems to be a demand for treatments which involve greater physical contact: Many alternative and complementary treatments feature ‘‘light touch þ ahealing meaning'' (Kerr et al., 2011, p. 785)

Acupuncture, for exam- ple, involves significant physical contact and causes a strong placebo effect (Kaptchuk et al., 2006, 2008).

These examples show that the humane aspects of medicine are crucial for patients' well-being. This observation does not fit with con- temporary approaches to medicine, which are entirely materialist, but it fits perfectly well with STS

Accordingly, the advertising of a drug—a kind of manipulative teaching—enhances the drug's placebo effect (Kamenica, Naclerio, {\&} Malani, 2013).

Classical conditioning is one of the main mechanisms of the placebo effect (Benedetti et al., 2003; Stewart-Williams {\&} Podd, 2004). Furthermore, culture influences the placebo effect: For 30 years, the placebo effect of antidepressant med- ication has increased while the treatment effect remained the same (Undurraga {\&} Baldessarini, 2012; Walsh, Seidman, Sysko, {\&} Gould, 2002).

This can be interpreted as an effect of learning on a large scale. Slowly, antidepressants have become a part of popular medical culture and it has become a standard means of treating depressed moods (Kirsch, 2011; Moerman, 2013).

However, from the perspec- tive of the STS, the much-discussed but nevertheless poorly understood placebo effect is an adaptation to a medical envi- ronment where the social component was much more important for adequate treatment.

Predictions and Testable Hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: Patients should show stronger symptoms in a social environment as compared to in isolation.

Hypothesis 2: When other people acknowledge the status of the sick individual and start helping, then the symptoms should diminish.

Hypothesis 3: The more sick individuals compete for help and the more scarce potential helpers are, the stronger the expression of symptoms of sick individuals should be.

Hypothesis 4: The aforementioned hypotheses (Hypotheses 1–3) should only be valid for easily discernible symptoms but not for indiscernible aspects of the immune reaction.

(When testing this last hypothesis, the fact that different
aspects of the immune system are closely interrelated must be taken into account.)


Hypothesis 5: The placebo effect should rather be found in symptoms that do not elicit disgust in potential helpers.

(the theory of the behavioral immune systems suggests that disgust should be strongest when infection is most likely. So, symptoms of pain and depression should be suitable signals. Accordingly, these are also the symptoms that show the most reliable placebo effects.)

Hypothesis 6a: When helpers are distant, the sufferer should have strong symptoms that are recognizable from far, such as noises like sneezing, coughing, and cries of pain.

Hypothesis 6b: When helpers are close, the sufferer should not have symptoms that raise the risk of infection of poten- tial helpers, such as coughing and sneezing. Instead, the sufferer should have strong symptoms, such as fever, that are recognizable from close proximity and that do not raise the risk of infection.

Hypothesis 7: Signaling symptoms should only be found in species, where care of the sick can be found.

Accordingly, the most complex regulation patterns of symptoms of sickness can be found in highly social species (Hen- nessy, Deak, {\&} Schiml, 2014)

Hypothesis 8: In species that show maternal care, but not care for sick adults, signaling symptoms should be found in young animals but not in adults.

CONCLUSION
According to the STS, the human immune system is adapted to Paleolithic times, when medical care consisted of different kinds of social support and when, in case of illness, it was crucial to mobilize this help. Thus, openly discernible aspects of an immune reaction's symptoms have not only been natu- rally selected for defense but also for their signaling effective- ness. They are exaggerated to mobilize help. Exaggerated symptoms are trustworthy because they are costly. Further- more, some exaggerated symptoms can be interpreted as a self-harming behavior on the part of the sufferer, which may extort help from interdependent group members. When support and treatment are granted, the function of the signal is fulfilled, and the immune reaction can decrease to the intensity level that is optimal for defense.},

annote = {Positivism

‘positivism' has been central in the philosophy-of-science when Comte (1844) introduced the term

Nietzsche's (1901: 267) description of the approach as the doctrine that ‘halts at phenomena: ‘‘there are only facts”'. To whichNietzsche promptly retorts: ‘No, facts is precisely what there is not, only inter- pretations'

Hempel: ‘Science is ultimately intended to systematize data of our experience.;

Etymologically, the word positivism comes from the Latin positum, the supine form of pono, put, set, place or lay.

Thus, something is put, set, placed or laid; this something is given facts or data, and the one they lie in front of is the researcher.

Data are consequently something that exists, is (already) there, and the task of the researcher thus becomes to gather and systematize them

for Comte and also for the logical positivists in the twentieth century, theory, the systematization of data, was central

Current social science positivists focusing on statistical analysis are found somewhere in between these positions: 

theory, seen as a summing of data, is accepted, but the theoretical propositions are both less encompassing and less systematized than the logical positivists' prescriptions of universally valid, formalized axiomatic systems.

Data or facts should, according to positivism, be observable, and here is the link to empiricism (Harr{\'{e}}, 1981).

The logical positivists made a sharp distinction between theoretical language and observation language (reflecting the dichotomy between theory and empirical facts). The former was supposed to be translatable to the latter through so-called correspondence rules.

As we shall see, this distinction was put in doubt by critics of positivism, who pointed out that all facts are theory-laden. If we talk about results of measurements, this already presupposes both theories about the instruments that measure and theoretical preconceptions ofwhat we measure (otherwise we would not know what to measure)


Structuralism, hermeneutics and phenomenology became the new banners under which many social scientists and humanists gathered. 

For the proponents of change, not as least important was the access to something of a fifth column in the very camp of the enemy: 

Kuhn's ideas of paradigms and para- digmatic revolutions – ideas that had emerged from within a positivist environment

Kuhn, Feyerabend,Hanson and Toulmin have been given the umbrella term‘histor- ical relativists' (Suppe, 1977), since they held that scientific knowledge is histori- cally and socially conditioned, and so is not absolutely true but relative in character.

The purpose of scientific activity no longer stands out as a statistical putting together of surface phenomena in an observed reality.

The important thing rather becomes to conceive this reality as an expression for, or a sign of, deeper-lying processes

latter took the shape of law-like ‘patterns' lying behind and explaining the manifestations of observed reality. 

The Marxists and other dialecticians focused their interest on the hidden driving forces and mechanisms that in the form of in-built laws of movement, generated by contradictions, govern and develop the systems.

The structuralists sought to trace structures that made their imprints on the matter of reality. The hermeneuticians interpreted the meanings that form the backdrop to and bring understanding of our language and actions},

@article{Wacquant2010,
abstract = {In Punishing the Poor, I show that the ascent of the penal state in the United States and other advanced societies over the past quarter-century is a response to rising social insecurity, not criminal insecurity; that changes in welfare and justice policies are interlinked, as restrictive “workfare” and expansive “prisonfare” are coupled into a single organizational contraption to discipline the precarious fractions of the postindustrial working class; and that a diligent carceral system is not a deviation from, but a constituent component of, the neoliberal Leviathan. In this article, I draw out the theoretical implications of this diagnosis of the emerging government of social insecurity. I deploy Bourdieu's concept of “bureaucratic field” to revise Piven and Cloward's classic thesis on the regulation of poverty via public assistance, and contrast the model of penalization as technique for the management of urban marginality to Michel Foucault's vision of the “disciplinary society,” David Garland's account of the “culture of control,” and David Harvey's characterization of neoliberal politics. Against the thin economic conception of neoliberalism as market rule, I propose a thick sociological specification entailing supervisory workfare, a proactive penal state, and the cultural trope of “individual responsibility.” This suggests that we must theorize the prison not as a technical implement for law enforcement, but as a core political capacity whose selective and aggressive deployment in the lower regions of social space violates the ideals of democratic citizenship.},

@book{Schellenberg1973,
abstract = {In 1970 –1971, I was invited to spend the year in Stanford, California, at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. During that year, I was given all the support, encouragement, and freedom to do whatever I wanted, and I was assured that I was not responsible to anyone for anything. There, on a beautiful hill, roughly 30 miles from San Francisco (my favorite city), with a whole year in which to do anything my heart desired, I chose to write this book. Surrounded as I was by the beauty of the countryside, and close as I was to the excitement of San Francisco, why did I lock myself in a cubicle and write a book? It's not that I'm crazy and it's not that I needed the money. If there's a single reason why I wrote this book, it's that I once heard myself tell a large class of sophomores that social psychology is a young science—and it made me feel like a coward. Let me explain: We social psychologists are fond of saying that social psychology is a young science—and it is a young science. Of course, astute observers have been making interesting pronouncements and proposing exciting hypotheses about social phenomena at least since the time of Aristotle, but these pronouncements and hypotheses were not seriously tested until well into the 20th century. The first systematic social psychological experiment (to my knowledge) was conducted by Triplett in 1898 (he measured the effect of competition on performance), but it was not until the late 1930s that experimental social psychology really took off, primarily under the inspiration of Kurt Lewin and his talented students. By the same token it is interesting to note that, although Aristotle first asserted some of the basic principles of social influence and persuasion around 350 BC, it was not until the middle of the 20th century that those principles were put to the experimental test by Carl Hovland and his associates.},

Money can thus possibly substitute for social acceptance in conferring the ability to obtain benefits from the social system. Moreover, past work has suggested that responses to physical pain and social distress share common underlying mechanisms. Six studies tested relationships among reminders of money, social exclusion, and physical pain. Interpersonal rejection and physical pain caused desire for money to increase. Handling money (compared with handling paper) reduced distress over social exclusion and diminished the physical pain of immersion in hot water. Being reminded of having spent money, however, intensified both social distress and physical pain.},

Computer-tomographic imaging and computer-assisted reconstruction of the skull revealed a healed fracture in the cranial vault. When paleopathological and forensic diagnostic standards are applied, the bony scar bears direct evidence for the impact of a sharp implement, which was presumably directed toward the individual during an act of interpersonal violence. These findings add to the evidence that Neanderthals used implements not only for hunting and food processing, but also in other behavioral contexts. It is hypothesized that the high intra-group damage potential inherent to weapons might have represented a major factor during the evolution of hominid social behavior.},

There are multiple mechanisms that sustain social norms, including a desire to coordinate, fear of being sanctioned, signaling membership in the group, or simply following the lead of others. This article shows how stochastic evolutionary game theory can be used to study the dynamics of norms. We illustrate with a variety of examples drawn from economics, sociology, demography, and political science. These include bargaining norms, norms governing the terms of contracts, norms of retirement, duelling, footbinding, medical treatment, and the use of contraceptives. These cases highlight the challenges of applying the theory to empirical cases. They also show that the modern theory of norm dynamics yields insights and predictions that go beyond conventional equilibrium analysis.

First, employees were presented a short description of a specific situation in which social relations with their colleagues might play a significant role. They had to indicate if (or how often) this specific situation occurred with each of the colleagues. Second, respondents were asked to indicate whether a specific relational concept (in this case ‘advice' or ‘friendship') applied to each of their relations with their colleagues. Third, we provided respondents with four semantic differentials (e.g. distrust-trust) on which they needed to position their relation with the other employees. Whether these different measurement instruments capture distinct aspects of the relation between employees, or whether they measure the same underlying concepts, is one of the major concerns of this paper. The aim of this paper is twofold. First of all, we want to know to what extent these different measurement instruments overlap. Second, we would like to find out to what degree these different methods as a whole give us conceptually different and complementary information. To the extent that items are correlated within one method and between methods we need to investigate which of these different instruments is best suited for our content related purposes.

Manipulation of central, regulatory internal and external stimuli has been a key focus within deception research, attempting to influence the self-regulation of exercise and induce improvements in performance. The methods manipulating performance modifiers such as unknown task endpoint, deceived duration or intensity feedback, self-belief or previous experience creates a challenge within research as, although they contextualise theoretical propositions, there are few ecological and practical approaches to integrate theory with practice. Additionally the different methods and measures demonstrated in manipulation studies have produced inconsistent results. This review examines and critically evaluates the current methods of how specific centrally-controlled performance modifiers have been manipulated, within deception studies, to investigate their effects on pacing and performance. From the 31 studies reviewed, 10 reported positive effects on performance, encouraging future investigations to explore the mechanisms responsible for influencing pacing, and consequently how deceptive approaches can further facilitate performance. The review acts to discuss the use of expectation manipulation not only to examine which methods of deception are successful in facilitating performance, but also to understand further the key components used in the regulation of exercise and performance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Trainers and physical fitness coaches' need a useful tool to assess training loads to avoid overtraining. However, perceived scales or questionnaires were required. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether a short 8-item questionnaire of fatigue could be a useful tool for monitoring changes in perceived training load and strain among elite rugby Sevens (7s) players during preparation for a major competition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Sixteen elite rugby 7s players completed an 8-week training program composed of 6-week intense training (IT) and 2-week reduced training (RT). They were tested before (T0), after the IT (T1) and after the RT (T2). The quantification of the perceived training load and strain were performed by the session-RPE (rating of perceived exertion) method and concomitantly the 8-item questionnaire of fatigue was administered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Training load (TL) and strain (TS) and total score of fatigue (TSF from the 8-item questionnaire) increased during IT and decreased during RT. Simultaneously, physical performances decreased during IT and were improved after LT. The changes in TL, TS and TSF correlated significantly over the training period (r=0.63-0.83).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the short questionnaire of fatigue could be a practical and a sensitive tool for monitoring changes in training load and strain in team-sport athletes. Accordingly, the simultaneous use of the short questionnaire of fatigue along with the session-RPE method for perceived changes in training load and strain during training could provide additional information on the athletes' status, allowing coaches to prevent eventual states of overreaching or overtraining.},

abstract = {Objectives: Understanding of the physical demands and the effects of fatigue and substitute players in rugby sevens is limited. This study quantified the differences in movement patterns between domestic and international rugby sevens tournaments, the effects of fatigue within and between matches during tournaments, and movement patterns of second half substitute players. Design: Movement patterns of 19 international-level male rugby sevens players were recorded using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device during 11 international and 16 domestic matches (n= 174 files). Methods: Maximum velocity, total distance covered, distance covered in velocity zones and number of moderate and high accelerations and decelerations are reported per min of match time. Movement patterns were compared between international and domestic matches, first and second half, first and last tournament match and substitute and full-match players. Results: Substantially greater distance was covered at high velocity (???27{\%} at ???6ms 
                        -1) and 4-39{\%} more accelerations and decelerations were performed in international than domestic matches. The relative distance covered by players at velocities {\textgreater}2ms 
                        -1 and the number of changes in velocity were reduced by 1-16{\%} from first to second half. Small differences were observed in activity at {\textless}5ms 
                        -1 (-8-8{\%}) and moderate accelerations (-18{\%}) from first to last tournament match. All movement variables were higher (2-123{\%}) for substitute players. Conclusions: International rugby sevens competition is more intense than domestic matches. Despite reductions in work-rate within individual matches, there is little indication of accumulated fatigue over a multi-day tournament. ?? 2011 Sports Medicine Australia.},

Associations between measurements were assessed by correlation analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Rugby sevens players had anthropometric characteristics (body mass 89.7 ± 7.6 kg, height 1.83 ± 0.06 m, sum of 7 skinfolds 52.2 ± 11.5 mm; mean ± SD) similar to those of backs in international 15-player rugby union. Acceleration and speed (40-m sprint 5.11 ± 0.15 s), muscle-power (vertical jump 66 ± 7 cm), and endurance (VO2max 53.8 ± 3.4 mL {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1) qualities were similar to, or better than, those of professional 15-a-side players. Coefficients of variation ranged from 2.5{\%} to 22{\%}. Relative VO2max was largely correlated with Yo-Yo distance (r = .60, .21-.82; 90{\%} confidence interval) and moderately correlated with 40-m sprint time (r = -.46, -.75 to -.02) and repeated-sprint ability (r = -.38, -.72 to .09).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: International rugby sevens players require highly developed speed, power, and endurance to tolerate the demands of competition.

abstract = {Data from repeated measures experiments are usually analyzed with conventional ANOVA. Three well-known problems with ANOVA are the sphericity assumption, the design effect (sampling hierarchy), and the requirement for complete designs and data sets. This tutorial explains and demonstrates multi-level modeling (MLM) as an alternative analysis tool for repeated measures data. MLM allows us to estimate variance and covariance components explicitly. MLM does not require sphericity, it takes the sampling hierarchy into account, and it is capable of analyzing incomplete data. A fictitious data set is analyzed with MLM and ANOVA, and analysis results are compared. Moreover, existing data from a repeated measures design are re-analyzed with MLM, to demonstrate its advantages. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that MLM yields higher power than ANOVA, in particular under realistic circumstances. Although technically complex, MLM is recommended as a useful tool for analyzing repeated measures data from speech research. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Athletes completed the Youth Experiences Survey 2.0 (Hansen {\&} Larson, 2005) and a modified measure assessing task and outcome interdependence (Van der Vegt, Emans, {\&} Van de Vliert, 1998 Vliert, 2001). Hierarchical multiple regression determined that basketball players reported higher rates of teamwork and social skills, adult networks and social capital, and negative experiences. Furthermore, outcome interdependence was a predictor of identity exploration, initiative, emotional regulation, positive relationships, teamwork and social skills, and adult networks and social capital experiences independent of sport type. Although different sports may provide different learning environments, the developmental experiences youth garner may be more strongly influenced by how the people involved interact (outcome interdependence) than by the type of sport.

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers faced with nonnormal data often try short-
cuts such as transforming data to achieve normality and homogeneity of variance, using nonparametric tests or rely- ing on the robustness of classical ANOVA to nonnormality for balanced designs

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) combine the properties of two statistical frameworks that are widely used in EE, linear mixed models (which incorporate random effects) and generalized linear models (which handle nonnormal data by using link functions and exponential family [e.g. nor- mal, Poisson or binomial] distributions)

all one has to do, in principle, is specify a distribution, link function and structure of the random effects},

abstract = {Described a meta-analysis which examines experimental studies on the relationship between experimental manipulations of social support and physiological reactivity, identifies variables that appear to moderate the effect of social support on physiological reactivity (if such an effect exists), and make empirically-based recommendations for future research. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they involved manipulation of social support under laboratory conditions, used human participants, and reported measurements of cardiovascular, skin conductance, or cortisol reactivity. Thus, 22 studies were used in the present meta-analysis, producing 26 comparisons and 56 effect sizes. The number of participants in each comparison ranged from 20-104, yielding an average sample size of 45 and a total sample size of 1,167. Participants' average age ranged from 16-28 yrs. The results indicate that the experimental manipulation of social support has generally been reported as having a medium to large attenuating effect on hemodynamic reactivity measured in the laboratory. As such, the findings from studies of recently-developed laboratory analogues may be interpreted as confirming that social support has a attenuating effect on reactivity induced by behavioral change.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Trainers and physical fitness coaches' need a useful tool to assess training loads to avoid overtraining. However, perceived scales or questionnaires were required. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether a short 8-item questionnaire of fatigue could be a useful tool for monitoring changes in perceived training load and strain among elite rugby Sevens (7s) players during preparation for a major competition. METHODS: Sixteen elite rugby 7s players completed an 8-week training program composed of 6-week intense training (IT) and 2-week reduced training (RT). They were tested before (T0), after the IT (T1) and after the RT (T2). The quantification of the perceived training load and strain were performed by the session-RPE (rating of perceived exertion) method and concomitantly the 8-item questionnaire of fatigue was administered. RESULTS: Training load (TL) and strain (TS) and total score of fatigue (TSF from the 8-item questionnaire) increased during IT and decreased during RT. Simultaneously, physical performances decreased during IT and were improved after LT. The changes in TL, TS and TSF correlated significantly over the training period (r=0.63-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the short questionnaire of fatigue could be a practical and a sensitive tool for monitoring changes in training load and strain in team-sport athletes. Accordingly, the simultaneous use of the short questionnaire of fatigue along with the session-RPE method for perceived changes in training load and strain during training could provide additional information on the athletes' status, allowing coaches to prevent eventual states of overreaching or overtraining. },

We focus on the controversies among three major theories of how cognitions about the self mediate dissonance processes: Self-consistency (Aronson, 1992), Self-affirmation (Steele, 1988), and the New Look perspective (Cooper {\&} Fazio, 1984). It is argued that each of these contemporary revisions of dissonance theory assumes that dissonance begins when people commit a behavior and then assess the meaning of the behavior against a standard for judgment. However, each approach makes different predictions for how self-knowledge mediates dissonance because each assumes different self-attributes and standards are used to assess the psychological meaning of a given behavior. The proposed model suggests that the basis of dissonance motivation and the role played by cognitions about the self depend on the type of self-standards made accessible in the context of discrepant behavior. By examining the ways in which people use self-standards to assess the social appropriateness or personal quality of their behavior and use self-attributes to reduce their discomfort, the proposed model can predict the conditions under which each of the contemporary views of the self in dissonance is the most accurate explanation of the process of dissonance arousal and reduction.},

abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate the influences of the accumulative effect of two consecutive rugby sevens matches (Sevens) on aspects of human neutrophil-related non-specific immunity. METHODS: In seven players participating in the Japan Sevens, neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production capability and phagocytic activity were measured using flow cytometry, and serum opsonic activity (SOA) was assessed by measuring neutrophil ROS using the peak height of lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence before and after two consecutive matches. RESULTS: ROS showed no change immediately after the first match, and had significantly (P{\textless}0.05) increased 4 h later, but showed a decrease after the second match. Phagocytic activity showed no change immediately after the first match, but had significantly (P{\textless}0.01) decreased 4 h later, and showed a further decrease after the second match, although it was not significant. SOA significantly (P{\textless}0.01) increased after the first match, and still maintained its high 4 h later, but decreased after the second match. ROS production capability, phagocytic activity and SOA significantly (P{\textless}0.01) decreased after the second match. CONCLUSIONS: When rugby players play two consecutive Sevens matches, the exercise loading is thought to be hard, similar to that experienced during a marathon race and intensive or long training in a training camp, although the expected changes were not seen after the first match. Differences between after the first and the second matches may be due to the "cumulative effect".},

abstract = {The occurrence of cooperation poses a problem for the biological and social sciences. However, many aspects of the biological and social science literatures on this subject have developed relatively independently, with a lack of interaction. This has led to a number of misunderstandings with regard to how natural selection operates and the conditions under which cooperation can be favoured. Our aim here is to provide an accessible overview of social evolution theory and the evolutionary work on cooperation, emphasising common misconceptions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
annote = {Explaning Adaptation:

The process of adaptation occurs via the action of natural selection, which is driven by the differential reproductive success of individual organisms.

Darwin explained the purpose of adaptation: he argued that evolved characters will appear designed as if to maximize the individual's reproductive success.

These ideas were later formalised in mathematical terms by Fisher (Fisher, 1930, 1941), who used population genetics theory to describe natural selection in terms of changes in gene frequencies.

the work of Fisher and others (Haldane, 1932; Wright, 1931) was celebrated for uniting Darwinism with Mendelian genetics, showing that they were not competing alternative explanations for evolution (Provine, 2001). 

Inclusive Fitness:
Hamilton's development of inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964). The traditional Darwinian view struggled to explain many cooperative social behaviours, with the most famous example being the sterile worker caste in eusocial insect species, the ants, bees, wasps, and termites.

characters favoured by natural selection are those which improve the individual's “inclusive fitness,” which is the sum of its direct and indirect fitness.

Another way of thinking about this is that inclusive fitness represents the components of reproductive success of the actor and their social partners over which the actor has control (Fig. 1)

inclusive fitness theory takes the dynamics of gene frequency change (the gold standard of evolutionary theory) and turns them into predictions about how individuals should behave (which can be tested with relative ease)

From an evolutionary point of view, a behaviour (or action) is social if it has fitness consequences for both the individual that performs that behaviour (the actor) and another individual (the recipient).

whether a behaviour is beneficial or costly is defined on the basis of: (i) the lifetime fitness consequences of the behaviour and (ii) the fitness of individuals relative to the whole population.

Indirect Fitness Benefits of Cooperation 

1. Kin Discrimination: 
when an individual can distinguish relatives from non-relatives and preferentially direct aid towards them (nepotism) (Hamilton, 1964).

Kin discrimination can occur through the use of environmental or genetic cues (Grafen, 1990b). 

Environmental cues: such as prior association or shared environment, appear to be the most common mechanism of kin discrimination and have been found in organisms ranging fromantstohumans(Helanter{\"{a}} {\&} Sundstr{\"{o}}m, 2007; Lieberman et al., 2003),

2. Limited dispersal (population viscosity): can generate high degrees of relatedness between interacting individuals because it will tend to keep relatives together (Hamilton, 1964).

In this case, unconditional cooperation directed indiscriminately at other group members (neighbours) could be favoured, because group members (those neighbours) are more likely to be relatives (have a coefficient of relatedness above the population average).

all that is required is that the level of cooperation evolves in response to the average relatedness between individuals who tend to interact by chance.

Direct Fitness Benefits of Cooepration

In this case, cooperation is mutually beneficial, not altruistic, and hence would be favoured by “self interested” or “selfish” agents (West et al., 2007b). 

By-product benefits:

direct benefits of cooperating may flow
automatically (passively) as a by-product of helping another individual (Darwin, 1871; Chapter 3)

Coordinated foraging in groups appears to be an example of this, where everyone gains an immediate benefit from increased acquisition of food, such as in African wild dogs.

Group Augmentation:
where the benefits can be in the future, rather than immediate, is if cooperation leads to an increase in group size, which increases the fitness of everyone in the group, including the individual who performs the cooperative behaviour (Kokko et al., 2001; Wiley {\&} Rabenold, 1984; Woolfenden, 1975). This process, termed group augmenta- tion, has been argued to be important in many coopera- tively breeding vertebrates, such as meerkats, where a larger group size can provide a benefit to all the members of the group through an increase in survival, foraging success and the likelihood of winning conflicts with other groups (Clutton-Brock, 2002).

Enforcement:
mechanism for enforcing cooperation by rewarding cooperators or punishing cheaters.

Direct reciprocity

Indirect reciprocity

after 40 years of enthusiasm, there is a lack of a clear example of reciprocity in a non-human species, and so, it is clearly not a major force outside of humans

other possibilities have been termed punishment, policing, sanctions, partner switching and partner choice (Bergm{\"{u}}ller et al., 2007; Frank, 2003; Sachs et al., 2004; West et al., 2007a).

Why enforce? 
The simplest way in which punishment could provide a direct fitness advantage is if it led to the termination of interactions with relatively uncooperative individuals (ostracism) and, hence, allowed interactions to be focused on more cooperative individuals (Frank, 2003; Murray, 1985; Schuessler, 1989; West et al., 2002b).

5.3. Interactions (between mechanisms) and the origins of cooperation

In cases where these processes are invoked, it is therefore likely that cooperation initially arose due to factors such as indirect fitness benefits or shared interests, and that only after this do mechanisms such as reciprocity or punishment select for higher levels of cooperation, even when relatedness falls to zero. So,

So, for humans, it may be unnecessary to prove how cooperation can arise de novo in unrelated populations if it originated in a hominid that lived in groups of relatives.

16 Misconceptions of social evolutionary theory:

Misconception 1: The various redefinitions of altruism

eg. cost to individual for eventual net direct benefit - this should be called "mutually beneficial"

The first problem with these redefinitions is that they lack a formal justification to use intentional language from an evolutionary or ultimate perspective.

natural selection produces organisms that behave intentionally, as maximizing agents, at the level of lifetime reproductive success.

The second problem is that these redefinitions include scenarios where cooperation could provide a direct fitness benefit, and hence be either mutually beneficial (+/+) or altruistic (−/+).

redefinitions of altruism
obscure the fundamental distinction between when direct or indirect fitness benefits are required to explain the observed cooperation (Dawkins, 1979; Smuts, 1999; West et al., 2007b).},

The meso-level institutional factors of organizational strengths and competitiveness are important, but religious organizations are severely constrained by restrictive regulations in China. I argue that the macro-level contextual factors are very important to understand the phenomenon of large-scale conversion to Christianity in China today. The crucial contextualfactors are the increasingly globalized market economy under political repression. Christianity provides peace and certainty in facing wild market forces. The Christian faith is liberating amid a stifling political atmosphere.

These bonds are so important that disrupting them leads to health problems, and difficulties forming or maintaining friendships attend neuropsychiatric disorders like autism and depression. Other animals also have friends, suggesting that friendship is not solely a human invention but is instead an evolved trait. A neuroethological approach applies behavioral, neurobiological, and molecular techniques to explain friendship with reference to its underlying mechanisms, development, evolutionary origins, and biological function. Recent studies implicate a shared suite of neural circuits and neuromodulatory pathways in the formation, maintenance, and manipulation of friendships across humans and other animals. Health consequences and reproductive advantages in mammals additionally suggest that friendship has adaptive benefits.

Hinde17 andpropose that, like all relationships, friendship should be defined on the basis of the quality and patterning of inter- actions between individuals 

bidirectional affiliative (nonaggressive, nonreproductive) interactions with such frequency and consistency so as to differentiate them from nonfriends.

Although tempting, we believe it best to steer clear of definitions that assume the involvement of specific proximate mechanisms (e.g., reciprocity). be based on different evolutionary strategies depending on the types of interactions involved or the identities of the social partners.

Kin selection is an obvious potential explanation for affiliative interactions between relatives7,15,21 but cannot explain interactions between nonrelatives. This does not mean we should exclude affiliative relationships between kin from being defined as friends. Indeed, as we shall discuss, determining the mechanism(s) upon which cooperation between friends operates is amajor line of inquiry open tomuch debate

We also wish to avoid definitions based on emotional engagement (e.g., love, attachment)since this is also a proximate, neurobiological mechanism that serves to promote, modify, and maintain social bonds and does not directly represent the evolved function of the bond itself

For friendships to form, individualsmust first have access to others. In primates, the ancestral state is one of solitary living

Shultz et al. (2011) modeled the trajectory of primate social systems and found that stable groups composed of multiple adult males and females arose from solitary life, with harems and pair-bonded groups arising afterward

Primates are unusual in their rarity of pair bonds, which are more common in other animals, particularly birds

Group living in primates is believed to have followed the shift from nocturnal to diurnal living as ameans to defend against predators in amore visualworld

Following the formation of stable social groups, regular interactions between conspecifics became possible

Affiliative tendencies have a heritable basis in humans,26 marmots (Marmota flaviventris),27 and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)28 (Fig. 2), confirming that sociality is under genetic control and is thus a trait uponwhich selection may act

The relationship between genes and social behavior is, of course, mediated by the nervous system. 

The social brain hypothesis posits that group living created selective pressures for larger and more complex brains.29,30 The last decade has been replete with evidence that brain size scales with social complexity across species,8,24,31 drawing ties between neural complex- ity and increased cognitive demands of social life.

FRIENDSHIP (in other taxa)
Mother–daughter pairs are the most common, followed by siblings.14 Female giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis thornicroftii) are more likely to associate with their mothers,32 apattern common in other herd-living mammals, including red deer (Cervus elaphus),33 bison (Bison bison),34 and elephants (Loxodonta africana).

PRIMATES
females remain in their natal groups, while males disperse
In these primates, kin-biased affiliative interactions, often measured using grooming and proximity, are common

In summary: many animals form friendships with conspecifics. 
Social bonds are often between related individuals, but bonds between nonrelatives are not uncommon

TO FORM FRIENDSHIPS:
animals must recognize the other members of their social group as unique individuals.51 They must track those individuals through space and time in order to coordinate their actions,16,52 and must make decisions about when to interact with others and what form those inter- actions should take

Social animals must also keep trackof the quality of their relationshipswith others; that is, are they friends or foes?

Biochemical regulation of friendship
namely those involving oxytocin (OT), endorphins, dopamine, serotonin, and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis

OT
OT is a neuropeptide that stimulates lactation in mammals and is involved in bonding between mothers and infants, aswell as betweenpair-bonded reproductive partners.110,111 OT has also been asso- ciated with social relationships outside of pair and maternal bonds. For example, OT is involved in in- dividual recognition and social memory.112,113 Ex- ogenous application of OT increases prosocial de- cisions and attention to others,114 increases feelings of trust,115 and encourages generosity.116

opioid ?-endorphin is also
involvedin rewardprocesses andhasbeenassociated with social behavior, especially in primates.55,117 Some researchers have proposed that while OT facilitates social interaction, it is B-endorphin that is crucial to the formation and maintenance of social bonds

The idea that OT facilitates social in- teraction, but not bonding, stems from the fact that the effects of OT are relatively short-lived119,120 and that OT reduces social vigilance,78 which may be a prerequisite for social interaction. Although not much is known about the relationship between en- dorphins and social interactions,118 the results of one new study support the association between en- dorphins and social bonds; individuals release more endorphinswhenrowing aboat in a social context— a prime example of behavioral synchrony,which is a key component of friendship

What mattered with reference toOTrelease, therefore,wasnot grooming in general, but grooming with a friend

This has led to the proposition that serotonin modulates how individuals perceive and respond to social information

The stress response, produced via activation of the HPA axis, warns animals that homeostasis has been disrupted and mobilizes energy to restore a homeostatic state

In animals for whom social relationships are crucial to success and survival, the stress response is part of the motivational system that underpins social interaction. Many animals, including humans, exhibit smaller increases in stress hormone (cortisol) levels during exposure to averse stimuli when a friend is present compared to when alone

In primates, social grooming reduces heart rate,132 and individuals with more tightly-knit so- cial networks have lower baseline levels of cortisol metabolites in their feces

For animals with tightly-knit and predictable social networks, low baseline cortisol levels may be a result of these in- dividuals being able to cope effectively with social challenges.

The acute reduction of heart rate in re- sponse to social grooming can be interpreted as a response to the fulfillment of a social need (negative feedback between endorphins,OT, and theHPAaxis is also likely to play a part).

This has led to the suggestion that stress reduction is a selective pressure in the evolution of social bonds and is, therefore, one of the ultimate functions of social bonding.

How- ever, it is important to rememberthat anassociation between the stress response and social behavior re-flects the role of the stress response as a proxi- mate mechanism underlying social interactions

THE FUNCTION OF FRIENDSHIP:
Silk et al. showedfemale baboons that spend a greater amount of time grooming and associating with others have offspring that are more likely to survive to 1 year of age; A similar association be- tween affiliation and infant survival has since been found in both male and female rhesus macaques 

true outside the primate order; affiliative interactions are a significant predictor of the number of foals born to female horses,9 and of lifetime reproductive success in marmots.27

In humans, research has focused on the ties be-
tween sociality and health.156 Socially isolated peo- ple are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease,157,158 infectious diseases,6 andelevatedblood pressure.159 One recent meta-analysis found a 50{\%} increased likelihood of survival for people with stronger so- cial relationships, even after controlling for age, sex, health, and cause of death

fitness seems to go beyond the mere frequency of social interactions to the formation of high-quality relationships

At least this is the case in female baboons, male Assamese macaques (M. assamensis), and dolphins, where in- dividuals with the strongest, most enduring social bondssire themostoffspring160 andhave the highest offspring survival161,162 and greatest longevity.

To- gether, these findings suggest that there are adaptive benefits to social bonds. But the question remains: What causes the association between friendship and fitness?

But how do we reconcile these differ- ences with the idea that social bonds are adaptive? If friendship is the route to success, why isn't ev- ery individual hypersocial? What other behavioral strategies and selective pressuresmight explainwhat otherwise appears to be noise in the system?},

annote = {SUMMARY POINTS

1. Evolution explains why biological organisms have traits that cause them to aid close relatives.Humans are no exception.

2. One way in which adaptations for cooperation can evolve is through themutual exchange of benefits at a cost over time.Humans engage in many such (reciprocal) transactions.

3. Recentmodels of the evolution of cooperation suggest that individuals can benefit from cultivating a reputation for being generous, which in turn elicits aid from others.

4. Signaling that one is generous can lead to benefits for the person signaling, such as being chosen as an exchange partner, friend, or mate.

5. A crucial issue in the evolution of cooperation is the role of punishment. In populations in which certain behaviors are punished, people are better off if they resist engaging in these behaviors, even if doing so is in their short-term interests.

6. Across cultures, people punish others who have violated moral norms, even when the violation leads to people being better off rather than worse off.Debates continue on the explanation for this human moralistic psychology.

7. Advances in theory andmethods have continued to elucidate the ultimate and proximate explanations of prosocial behavior. Much work remains to be done, aided by increasing cross-disciplinary efforts.




evolutionary explanations for the properties of the psychological mechanisms that cause these acts

Our central interest is in the evolutionary explanation for those psychological systems that are designed to deliver benefits to others.

explaining the properties of psychological benefit-delivery devices

the computational mechanisms in humans designed to aid others


Two types of explanations:

1. Kinship selection (Maynard Smith 1964): Inclusive Fitness explanations? 
genes can cause copies of themselves to increase in subsequent generations by causing the body they inhabit to deliver benefits to other individuals who carry those genes (Hamilton 1964)

2. Reciprocity (Trivers 1971)? why some organisms have psychological systems designed to aid even those not closely related. These explanations turn on how individuals who aid others can stand (eventually) to benefit as a result of giving aid to others?

humans across cultures tend to help
those most closely related to them - but more and more in our modern (missmatched?) world, humans cooperate and acquire benefits from non-kin ...

1. Kinship selection: the delivery of benefits tends to follow the logic laid out by Hamilton (see below), being strongest among close relatives—offspring and full siblings—and diminishing with distance

2。 A second type of social behavior is exchange. Humans across cultures and over time have
exchanged various goods and services, either in simultaneous transactions or in voluntary giving and receiving over time

3. Friendship: humans form relatively long-term nonkin relationships that include signif- icant amounts of cooperation and occasional forms of self-sacrificial behavior, and such friendships constitute an important part of human sociality.

4. cooperation in large non-kin-based groups： phenomena as varied as barn raising to large-scale military conflict among modern states

Exclusions: by-products, unintended mutualisms,

Instead, our interest is in functional traits that deliver benefits to other people. Our modern understanding of Darwin's (1859) theory of natural selection is that genes that increase the fitness of individuals will accumulate in populations

inclusive fitness, which is thesumof the individuals' influence on their own reproductive success (direct fitness) and that of their relatives (indirect fitness; Hamilton 1964, 1970)

MULTILEVEL SELECTION
there are multiple levels of selection (hence usually
termed multilevel selection), which can vary in their importance (Wilson 1975). For example, cooperation could be favored if the benefits at the group level (between-group benefits) outweighed the cost at the individual level (within-group costs)

in situations where kin selection or inclusive fitness could not account for cooperation or altruism, this new group selection approach provided an alternative explanation (e.g., Wilson {\&}H¨olldobler 2005)


PARENTS {\&} OFFSPRING:
The theory of evolution predicts that organisms' features will be designed for survival and reproduction, in the service of maximizing the representation of their offspring (and other relatives) in the next and subsequent generations.

Inclusive fitness theory neatly explains why organisms are often designed to help closely related others.

Heavy female parental investment is the rule among mammals, and humans are not overly exceptional in this respect (Hrdy 1999)

human paternal investment in offspring is remarkably large

Furthermore, male parental care is relatively costly in humans, compared to other animals, in terms of the extent to which care reduces the likelihood of successful breeding in the future (Griffin et a. 2013)

Anthropologists have provided substantial evidence that cooperation among kin plays important roles in additional contexts, such as alliance formation (Marlowe 2010) and the raising of offspring (Flinn 2011). Such patterns of kin discrimination are common in birds and mammals (Griffin {\&} West 2003).

people make use of particular cues, that is, features of the environ- ment that reliably correlate with genetic kin. For instance, Lieberman et al. (2007) documented how particular cues available during early development have important psychological effects. In particular, the tendency for directing altruism toward a sibling seems to depend positively on the length of coresidence with that sibling and observations of the sibling's perinatal association with the same mother


The hypothesis that there are psychological systems designed around reciprocitymakes a number of empirical predictions regarding the existence of specialized computational machinery to enable reciprocal exchange, many of which have been examined

Cosmides and colleagues, not uncontroversially (Sperber {\&} Girotto 2003), have gathered evidence over the past 20 years for just such a specialized psychological system (Cosmides {\&} Tooby 2008)


emotional systems designed to take advantage of the opportunities for potential gains in trade (see, e.g., Cosmides {\&} Tooby 1992, p. 177). These

EMPATHY
Of course, in modern environments many people in need elicit these emotions even though the probability of return help is exceedingly slim (Hagen {\&}Hammerstein 2006)

GUILT:
Ketelaar{\&}Au (2003) showed not only that people reported experiencing guilt when they defected in a bargaining game, but also that those who experienced guilt—whether as an endogenous reaction or through experimental induction—were more likely to cooperate in a subsequent experimental game (see also Nelissen et al. 2011). 

ANGER


"reciprocity models predict abandonment"

friends help friendswhen they have suffered a catastrophe, exactly a moment in which return benefits are least likely (Tooby {\&} Cosmides 1996) and reciprocity models predict abandonment.

Friendship is a type of social insurance:
when people are most in need, they are the worst investment from the standpoint of reciprocity and so least likely to be chosen as a reciprocal exchange partner. To buffer against this problem, individuals cultivate associations with other people who will come to value them, specifically, because of their particular talents, abilities, history, and so forth, so that when the individual suffers a reverse, those people will be motivated to come to their aid

Reputation tracking/emotional book-keeping


Publicness/visibility Nettle et al. 2013

Miller (2000) has proposed that human altruism systems might have been selected because they reliably signal properties of the altruist, increasing the altruist's outcomes on the mating market.

abstract = {In a classic study, Haley and Fessler showed that displaying subtle eye-like stimuli caused participants to behave more generously in the Dictator Game. Since their paper was published, there have been both successful replications and null results reported in the literature. However, it is important to clarify that two logically separable effects were found in their original experiment: watching eyes made the mean donation higher, and also increased the probability of donating something rather than nothing. Here, we report a replication study with 118 participants, in which we found that watching eyes significantly increased the probability of donating something, but did not increase the mean donation. Results did not depend on the sex of the participants or the sex of the eyes. We also present a meta-analysis of the seven studies of watching eye effects in the Dictator Game published to date. Combined, these studies total 887 participants, and show that although watching eyes do not reliably increase mean donations, they do reliably increase the probability of donating something rather than nothing (combined odds ratio 1.39). We conclude that the watching eyes effect in the Dictator Game is robust, but its interpretation may require refinement. Rather than making people directionally more generous, it may be that watching eyes reduce variation in social behavior. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding religion requires explaining why supernatu- ral beliefs, devotions, and rituals are both universal and vari- able across cultures, and why religion is so often associated with both large-scale cooperation and enduring group conflict. Emerging lines of research suggest that these oppositions result from the convergence of three processes. First, the interaction of certain reliably developing cognitive processes, such as our ability to infer the presence of intentional agents, favors—as an evolutionary by-product—the spread of certain kinds of counterintuitive concepts. Second, participation in rituals and devotions involving costly displays exploits various aspects of our evolved psychology to deepen people's commitment to both supernatural agents and religious communities. Third, competition among societies and organizations with different faith-based beliefs and practices has increasingly connected re- ligion with both within-group prosociality and between-group enmity. This connection has strengthened dramatically in re- cent millennia, as part of the evolution of complex societies, and is important to understanding cooperation and conflict in today's world. Keywords},
annote = {We argue that the cultural evolution of prosocial religions and the historical rise of large-scale civilizations involve the dynamic interaction of the by-products of adaptive cognitive mechanisms:

minimally counterintuitive beliefs and 
overextended agent concepts), 
adaptive learning heuristics (e.g., emulation of successful and prestigious individuals), credibility-enhancing ritual displays (e.g., self-sacrifice and costly commitments to seemingly preposterous beliefs), and 

cultural group selection for those packages of rituals, devotions, and beliefs that best sustain in-group prosocial norms (e.g., monumental undertakings, sacred values).

Many religions pose an evolutionary enigma because they
require costly commitments to beliefs that violate both core aspects of logical consistency and our intuitive expectations about howtheworldworks, both of which are otherwise crucial for successfully navigating the world (Atran and Norenzayan 70 2004).

At the same time, the origin of large-scale cooperative
human societies is also an evolutionary puzzle because people frequently cooperate and trade with non-relatives in ephemeral 80 interactions (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003). Thus, while the evo- lutionary mechanisms associated with kinship, reciprocity, and reputation clearly influence cooperation in important ways, they do not capture the fullest extent of human prosociality

Kinship cannot explain cooperation among non-relatives 85 (Henrich and Henrich 2007), though “fictive kinship”—a cultural manipulation of kin psychology—may contribute to mo- bilizing larger groups (Johnson 1987; Atran 2003)

Reciprocity does not suffice to explain cooperation beyond dense so- cial networks, small villages, or tightly knit neighborhoods

Neither direct nor indirect reciprocity can explain cooperation in transient interactions in large populations, because reputational information rapidly degrades as a function of population size, or in large-group interactions such as those asso- ciated with many kinds of public goods or common dilemmas 95 (Boyd and Richerson 1988; Panchanathan and Boyd 2003; Nowak and Sigmund 2005; Mathew and Boyd 2009).

Even more telling is that none of these mechanisms explains the variation in cooperation among human societies, or the massive expansion of cooperation in some societies over last 10 millennia (Henrich et al. 2005).

Converging lines of field and experimental evidence suggest that cultural evolution, building on certain innate cognitive foundations, has favored the emergence of beliefs in powerful moralizing deities concerned with the prosocial behavior of individuals beyond kin- and reciprocity-based networks (Norenzayan and Shariff 2008)


(1) religion—as a phenomenon with potentially deep roots (Klein 1989)—has not always been about high mor- alizing gods and (2) modernworld religions may have evolved to create a potent linkage between the supernatural and the prosocial.


COGNITIVE MECHANISMS:
Humansare purpose-seeking, cause-inferring, story-telling an- imals (Gazzaniga et al. 2009)

Rumination; SER
As Hume noted in The Natural History of Religion, the greater the impact of events on our 135 lives, the greater is our drive to impose purpose and coherence on those events.

Whitson and Galinsky 2008: Those who experienced a lack of control were more likely to see patterns and processes underlying the randomness, suggesting that under uncertainty we are more likely to find preternatural explanations for the randomness.

Both cross-cultural experiments and surveys indicate that people more readily ascribe to the veracity of nar- ratives containing counterintuitive elements (e.g., miracles) when primed with death (Norenzayan and Hansen 2006), or when facing danger or insecurity, as with pleas of hope for God's intervention during wartime (Argyle and Beit-Hallahmi 2000).

country's religiosity (devotion to a world reli- gion) is positively related to its degree of existential insecurity (Norris and Inglehart 2004), and why certain kinds of religions enjoy revivals in challenging times. The issue then becomes: how and why does purpose-seeking and cause-inferring so often deliver supernatural agents?

Religious traditions center on supernatural agents, such as gods, angels, or ancestor spirits. This includes religions such as Buddhism and Taoism, which doctrinally eschew personi- fying the supernatural, but whose adherents routinely worship an array of deities that behave inways that violate our intuitive expectations about how the world works (Pyysiainen 2003).

ToM:
Mundane agent concepts are central players in what psychol- 165 ogists refer to as folkpsychology, associated with a Theory of Mind module(s) (ToM), which is a cognitive system devoted to making inferences about the beliefs, desires, and intentions of other minds (Baron-Cohen 1995)

Agent concepts may be hair-trigger in our cognitive pro-
cessing, allowing us to readily respond under uncertainty to 175 potential threats by intelligent predators (Guthrie 1993)

From this evolutionary vantage, agent's proper evolutionary domain encompasses animate species, but its actual domain inadver- tently extends to moving dots on computer screens, voices in the wind, faces in clouds, complicated contrivances like 180 eyes, and virtually any complex design or uncertain circumstance of unknown origin (Sperber 1996)

Children and adults spontaneously interpret the contingent movements of dots and geometrical forms on a screen as interacting agents with dis- tinct goals and internal goal-directed motivations (Heider and 185 Simmel 1944; Bloom and Veres 1999; Csibra et al. 1999).




Religious beliefs are counterintuitive because they violate universal expectations about the world's mundane structure:

Experimental studies reveal that children across cultures do not violate such categorical constraints in learningword meaning; for example, people cannot literally melt, and neither can animals joke, trees 210 walk, nor rocks tire (Keil 1979)

Most religious beliefs minimally violate the expectations
created by our intuitive ontology and these modes of con- strual, thus creating cognitively manageable and memorable supernatural worlds.

Cognitive approaches hypothesize that although intuitive concepts transmit well, concepts that minimally deviate from intuition transmit better, while those that deviate greatly can- not transmit successfully because they overload cognitive pro- cesses that drive inferential reasoning and relevance (Atran and Sperber 1991).

Succesful transmission of minimally counter-intuitive ideas

Recall experiments indicate that mini- 250 mally counterintuitive concepts and beliefs enjoy a cognitive advantage in memory and transmission over intuitive concepts and mundane beliefs (Barrett and Nyhof 2001). Results have been observed immediately, as well as after a three-month de- lay, in samples from the United States, France, Gabon, Nepal 255 (Boyer and Ramble 2001), as well as from Maya (Atran and Norenzayan 2004).

Whether counterintuitive concepts are believed in, or committed to, more is another matter (think Jesus vs. Zeus), which is addressed below (also see Gervais and AQ Henrich forthcoming).

The Bible or the Koran, for example, involve successions of mundane events—walking, eating, sleeping, 265 marrying, fighting, and suffering—interspersed with a few counterintuitive occurrences, often involving miracles or the appearance of supernatural agents.


SOCIAL LEARNING - We must rely on faith to proceed

Place faith in traditional practices, without understanding why, can be adaptive.

Similarly, manufacturing complex technologies or medicines often involve a sequence of important steps, most of which cannot be skipped without producing an inferior outcome. Experimenta- 335 tion is of limited use in rearranging or dropping steps because even a relatively small number of steps yield a combinatorial explosion of possible alternative procedures. Learners must have faith, and copy all steps

Chimpanzees do some copying, but skip unnecessary steps, leading them to more efficient repertoires than children (Horner and Whiten 2005). Children implicitly assume that if the model performed a seemingly unnecessary action, it was probably important, even if they 355 cannot understand precisely why.

With the evolution of language, this faith in culturally transmitted information became vulnerable to exploita- tion by individuals—particularly successful and prestigious individuals—able to transmit practices or beliefs they them- 360 selves might not hold. Language makes exaggeration, dis- tortion, manipulation, and deception easy and cheap

Before language, learners observed and inferred people's underlying beliefs or desires by their behavior. 

Those wishing to deceive would have to actually perform an action to transmit it.

This means that if a model's belief causes him to perform “costly displays”—that is, actions that would be too costly for someone with different beliefs to perform—learners 380 should be more willing to learn from this model.

This suggests an approach to devotions (fasting, celibacy, etc.) and rituals as having evolved culturally (at least in part) to deepen people's commitments to counterintuitive beliefs. 405

In this view, costly ritual or devotional acts may have
evolved as a means to convince learners of the personal com- mitment of either the rest of the congregation (exploiting con- formist biases in our learning) or of locally prestigious models 420 (Henrich 2009).


Because of our adaptive need, at times, to rely wholly
on cultural information in the face of inconsistent experience or contradictory implications, natural selection likely favored something of a psychological immune system that cements adherence to adopted beliefs.

Experiments suggest that once 440 people sincerely commit to religious beliefs, attempts to un- dermine them through reason and evidence can stimulate the strengthening of personal commitments (Festinger et al. 1956).

These lines of reasoning and evidence suggest that commitment to supernatural agents tends to spread in a population to the extent it elicits costly displays, usually in the form of ritual ceremonies, offerings, devotions, and sacrifices.

Supernatural agents that incentivize costly sacrifices will tend to spread, creating an emerging linkage between degree of commitment to belief and costly displays

Religions have culturally evolved to deploy a variety of
other means to ratchet up faith and commitment. Faith in 480 otherwise inscrutable content is deepened and validated by communion:

The Navajo, for example, are among the most success- ful cooperators and survivors of Native American groups, with men spending upwards of one-third, and women one-fifth, of their productive time on “priestly rites” (Kluckholn and 505 Leighton 1946).

Historical studies suggest that early Chris- tianity spread to become the majority religion in the Roman Empire through costly displays such as martyrdom and char- ity (e.g., risking death by caring for sick non-Christians during epidemics; Stark 1997).

Strengthening the group through ritual participation and costly displays also applies to a variety of modern movements for civil and human rights that grow by “waging peace” in the battle for public opinion, including those modeled on the nonviolent doctrines and costly commit- ments (imprisonment, harassment, etc.) of Gandhi and M.L.King (Smith 1996).

Martyring spiritual leaders often stimu- lates the spread of their ideas by providing persuasive displays of the leader's deep commitment. 

Coevolution of Counterintuitive Beliefs and Norms for Complex Societies:
Counterintuitive beliefs are readily recalled and retransmit- ted. Rituals and devotions involving costly displays, music, rhythm, and synchrony can ratchet up the belief in, and commitment to, these counterintuitive beliefs.

Now, the questions are 
(1) how do these elements of effective rituals and devotions get assembled and linked with particular supernatural agents?;
(2) why do these supernatural agents so favor prosocial behavior, by forbidding stealing, lying, murdering, adultery, and so forth?; and
(3) why does this seem more prevalent in recent and increasingly large and complex societies?

A rising tide of evidence suggests that religious beliefs, rituals, devotions, and social norms have coevolved in interlocking cultural complexes in a process driven by competition among alternative complexes.

Game theoretic analyses show that when cultural learning is combined with social interaction, a variety of different stable states (i.e., social norms or institutions) emerge 

Unlike genetic transmission, this is even true in larger scale cooperative endeavors (Henrich and Boyd 2001; Panchanathan and Boyd 2004), in which both cooperative and defecting states can remain stable.

Existence of alternative stable sets of norms across human societies creates conditions in which competition among groups will favor the emergence of prosocial norms—that is, 560 norms that lead to success in competition with other groups. The most important norms are likely to be those that increase cooperation (e.g., in warfare and economic production) or re- duce within-group conflict, by regulating sexual relationships or managing disputes. Because this process involves competi- 565 tion among stable states, modeling shows that it does not suffer the challenges typically associated with the genetic group se- lection of altruism (Boyd and Richerson 2002)

By augment- ing these mechanisms, supernatural beliefs have culturally se- lective advantages over purely secular mechanisms (Johnson 580 2005). At the margins, the additional psychological threat of supernatural incentives reduces the costs of punishing viola- tors, provides a threat when no human eyes are watching, and may tilt the balance in situations when the benefits of defecting (charging a vast enemy) exceed the potential worldly costs.

If a transgressor has faith in divine awareness and retribution, then external policing, capture, and punishment “automatically” come from within.

Second, super-natural policing and incentives (heaven vs. hell) can buttress more worldly norm-sustaining mechanisms, such as punish- ment, signaling, and reputation

Third, when supernatural punishment is either indiscriminate or collective, third parties have a direct incen- tive to keep norm violators in line. If people believe that their god will punish everyone (say, by a drought) for the misdeeds of a few(e.g., adultery), then everyone has an incentive to keep everyone else in line.

Recentwork reveals that children's 605 beliefs in God as the creator of everything favors essentializ- ing of social categories, meaning that religious beliefs about divine creators predict the inferring that ethnic/religious cat- egory membership is stable (immutable: these effects seem limited to human categories, and do not influence judgments 610 about artifacts or animals)

This suggests that competition among socioreligious groups will favor beliefs that galvanize and reify group membership by extending our intuitive system for essence-based inferences (used for thinking about biologi- cal kinds; Atran 1998) to the relevant human social categories 615 (Diesendruck and Haber 2009)

Together with religious rituals, devotions, and insignia, such practices can foster a cohesive group iden- tity and increase solidarity vis-a-vis other groups. Here religion exploits and extends our “tribal psychology” that has long 635 marked group boundaries through language, dialect, and dress (McElreath et al. 2003)

Disregard of these was considered a reliable signal of sin and failure of 650 commitment. From this perspective, groups using such costly markers succeed because they (1) transmit commitment in the next generation, (2) eliminate, or identify, those lacking suf- ficient commitment to the group and its god(s) (Irons 1996; Sosis and Alcorta 2003), and (3) psychologically demarcate 655 the group inways that engage our tendency to essentialize and reify group boundaries.

Norms are often attached to powerful emotions (anger,
guilt, shame) that can be amplified by certain religious be- liefs into dread, awe, or anxiety.

Experiments show that when norms are associated with the sacred, they become emotionally charged and less influenced by material calcula- tions and tradeoffs (Tetlock 2003)

Such sacred values appear to be somewhat immune to 670 the rationality of realpolitik or the marketplace, implying that a “business-like” approach to negotiations in conflicts involving sacred values may backfire (Atran et al. 2007; Ginges et al. 2007; Dehghani et al. 2009).

From our perspective, increasing the material incentives to a believer in exchange for violating sacred values might result in substantial increasing of the sig- naling value obtained from rejecting the material payoffs.

The target of the signal might be God, one's fellows, or one's self.

PREDICTIONS:
Gods of increasingly complex societies should evolve to be more concerned with 
(1) in-group cooperation (help your co-religionists) harmony (no stealing, lying, or adultery), and fair exchange, 
(2) sexual and family relations (increasing reproduction of new adherents), and 
(3) the performance of commitment-inducing rituals (Roes 1995; Roes and Raymond 2003; Johnson 2005).

To better police and reward adherents, the gods of emerging complex societies need more knowledge of mortal behavior (evolution of omniscience) and more power to reward and punish (thus, an afterlife in heaven or hell)


The Religious Rise of Covilisations
Historicalwork suggests that the beliefs, rituals, and norms (e.g., inheritance rules, ethnic equality, judicial procedures) of Islam spread initially by providing a means of 705 unifying the warring Arabic tribes, giving them the ability to cooperate, conquer, and gradually assimilate surrounding peo- ples (Levy 1957).

Contemporary studies indicate that Islam spread into Sub-Saharan Africa by drawing people into tighter religiously based networks of trust that facilitate trade and eco- 710 nomic success (Ensminger 1997)

The archaeological record reveals a clear, coevolutionary connection between religion, ritual, and complex societies.


Recent finds indicate that rituals became much more formal, elaborate, and costly as societies developed from for- 720 aging bands into chiefdoms and states (Marcus and Flannery 2004; cf Whitehouse 2004)

Then, with the establishment of permanent villages and
multi-village chiefdoms (4000–3000 B.P.), rituals are man- 730 aged by social achievers (prestigious “Big Men” and chiefs)

It matters little if supernatural threats are real or not: if people believe in them, threats of punishment become real deterrents (Durkheim 1995).

SUMMARY:
In sum, religion, as an interwoven complex of rituals, beliefs, and norms, plausibly arises from a combination of 
(1) the mnemonic power of counterintuitive representations, 
(2) our evolved willingness to put faith on culturally acquired beliefs 920 rooted in the commitment-inducing power of devotions and rituals, and 
(3) the selective effect on particular cultural complexes created by competitionamongsocieties and institutions. 

None of these evolved for religion per se:

- The mnemonic power of minimally counterintuitive representations appears to be a by-product of our evolved expectations about how the world works and our fitness-enhancing requirement to pay attention to anomalies.

- The faith we sometimes place in culture over our own experience and intuitions is a cognitive adaptation, resulting from our long dependence on vast bodies of complex 930 cultural knowledge.

- Reliance on costly displays evolved to provide partial immunity against manipulation.

- The power of rhythm and synchrony in ritual to build solidarity (Wiltermuth and Heath 2009) likely arises from our imitative and ToMabil- ities.

Cultural evolution, driven by competition among groups, exploits each of these cognitive processes to fashion sets of counterintuitive beliefs, rituals, and norms that spread by inter- group transmission, conquest, or reproductive differentials

As a result, for large-scale societies, these complexes tend to in- 940 clude potent supernatural agents that monitor and incentivize actions that expand the sphere of cooperation, galvanize soli- darity in response to external threats, deepen faith, and sustain internal harmony},

abstract = {Human altruism in non-kin, unreciprocated contexts is difficult to understand in evolutionary terms. However, neo-Darwinian theories remain a potentially useful means of illuminating this behavior. In particular, induced altruism, wherein cues of genetic relatedness are manipulated to elicit costly behaviors for the benefit of non-kin, appears highly relevant. This article reviews cross-cultural data on several examples of extremely costly altruism-vows of celibacy, suicide bombings, and combat suicide-as exhibited in organizational and institutional contexts. Two predictions are used to test the relevance of induced altruism to the reinforcement of altruistic commitment to these behaviors. First, different organizations requiring costly sacrifice by their members should employ similar practices involving patterns of association, phenotypic similarity, and kinship terminology that are associated with kin cue-manipulation. Second, these organizational practices should be adopted as a consequence of recruit pools growing increasingly larger and, thus, less genetically related. There appears to be support for both predictions, suggesting that cross-cultural analyses could provide an effective avenue through which to test this and other evolutionary theories related to human unreciprocated altruism in non-kin contexts. {\textcopyright} 2013 SAGE Publications.},
annote = {organizations seeking to reinforce commitment among their members to desired altruistic behavior should make use of several specific practices related to kin-cue manipulation

the extreme costs of these actions suggest that commitment to them should often require reinforcement from the organizations in which they are typically manifested


Induced Altruism
Key to its definition is that altruistic behavior is elicited through coercion, manipulation, or deception (Irons, 1996)

“kinship deceit” (Trivers, 1985)

Human history is replete with examples of costly behavior induced by force: one need only consider examples of enslavement and imprisonment (Balch, 1985)

The relevant question then is not if altruism can be induced in humans, but whether an evolved psy- chology associated with kin recognition can be manipulated to reinforce com- mitment to altruistic behavior beyond that which is explained by rational thought, enculturation, or coercion.

social brain has arguably evolved as a consequence of cognitive competition around manipulation and its identification (Byrne {\&} Whiten, 1988; Gavrilets {\&} Vose, 2006; Whiten {\&} Byrne, 1997). 

More specifically, cognitive mechanisms related to manipula- tion in social contracts (Cosmides {\&} Tooby, 1992), sibling strategies (Michalski {\&} Euler, 2007), and reciprocal exchanges more generally (Allison, 1992) have been posited and, to some extent, supported.

likelihood that kinship cues and their identi- fication are important aspects of human cognition which, although sufficiently reliable to have been maintained via inclusive fitness selection in ancestral environments, are nevertheless subject to error (Park, Schaller, {\&} Van Vugt, 2008; Wells, 1987).

One such cue is association, where recognition occurs because of a typically consistent correlation between genetic relatedness and the location or timing of the associative period

Westermarck effect, which predicts a lack of sexual interest among individuals reared together. Sexual behavior of children in Israeli kibbutzim (Talmon, 1964) and Taiwanese arranged marriages (Wolf, 1995) have long been cited as examples, and recent reevaluations of these data support the likelihood of an evolved association cue in both cases (Lieberman, 2009; Lieberman, Tooby, {\&} Cosmides, 2003, Lieberman, Tooby, {\&} Cosmides, 2007)

For example, in two studies of kibbutzim, coresidence duration predicts both levels of altruism (in answers to survey questions) and sexual aversions directed toward peers (Lieberman {\&} Lobel, 2012)},

Japanese students reported greater discrepancies between their actual and ideal self-views than did European Canadians, but these dis- crepancies were less strongly related to depression for the Japanese than for the European Canadians (Heine {\&} Lehman, 1999)

Suh (2002) asked Korean and North American college students to describe themselves in several relationships (e.g., with a friend, a stranger, and a family member).

abstract = {The classical definition of altruism in evolutionary biology requires that an organism incur a fitness cost in the course of providing others with a fitness benefit. New insights are gained, however, by exploring the implications of an adaptationist version of the 'problem of altruism', as the existence of machinery designed to deliver benefits to others. Alternative pathways for the evolution of altruism are discussed, which avoid barriers thought to limit the emergence of reciprocation across species. We define the Banker's Paradox, and show how its solution can select for cognitive machinery designed to deliver benefits to others, even in the absence of traditional reciprocation. These models allow one to understand aspects of the design and social dynamics of human friendship that are otherwise mysterious.},
annote = {adaptationist as opposed to a selectionist perspective:

object of investigation is identifying and mapping the functional organization of the organism's machinery {\&} discovering exactly how this ordered arrangement produced propagation within the environment within which the machinery evolved

Adaptations are thus recognizable by 'evidence of special design' (Williams 1966)

highly non-random co-ordination between recurring properties of the phenotype and the recurring structure of the ancestral environment, so that when they interacted together they meshed to reliably promote fitness (genetic propagation)

The standards for recognizing special design include such factors as economy, efficiency, complexity, precision, special- ization, and reliability (Williams 1966)

Structures that can do what the eye does are extremely low-probability arrangements of matter

So, what would an adaptationist view of the problem of altruism be, as opposed to a selectionist view?

Focus on whether there was a highly nonrandom phenotypic complexity that is organized in such a way that it reliably causes an organism to deliver benefits to others, rather than on whether the delivery was costly

Moreover, once altruistic adaptations are in place, selection will act to minimize or neutralize their cost, or even make them secondarily beneficial, to the extent possible

The important distinction is whether the analysis of cross-generationally recurrent phenotypic structures can support the claim that there is machinery that is well-designed to deliver benefits to other organisms under ancestral conditions

George Williams (1966): the issue is not altruism per se, but design for altruism, that is, design for benefit delivery

the adaptationist task involves explaining how the
designed delivery of benefits to other organisms is ultimately tributary to the fitness of the genes underlying the altruistic adaptation, and in this task it is necessary to show that the fitness benefits are greater than the cost

evolving designs for delivering damage is easy and hence common, while evolving designs that can deliver narrowly targetted benefits is hard and hence rare. Because the task of correctly identifying and successfully enacting beneficial operations will often be very difficult, we think that such adaptations will frequently require complex computations, and suspect that at least some adaptations for altruism may turn out to rival the complexity of the eye

Human cognitive machinery does, as expected, sharply distinguish inanimate causal conditionals from social conditionals such as social exchanges and threats

More importantly, humans appear to have an independent specialized computational system that is well-designed for reasoning adaptively about the conditional relationships involved in social exchange (Cosmides 1989; Cosmides {\&} Tooby 1992; Gigerenzer {\&} Hug 1992)

growing body of evidence from cognitive development is
showing that human infants have cognitive machinery that makes sharp distinctions between animate and inanimate causation (Leslie 1988, 1994; Gelman 1990; Premack {\&} Premack 1994), and that toddlers have a well- developed 'mind-reading' system, which uses eye direction and movement to infer what other people want, know, and believe (Baron-Cohen 1995; Leslie {\&} Thaiss 1992)

The ability to compute the effects of actions on others, and to categorize
such acts in terms of their value to others, is a nontrivial requirement

It may be the rarity of this set of prerequisite adaptations, and not the cost problem, that is a real impediment to the frequent evolution of social exchange (e.g., the 'mind-reading' abilities of other primates appear to be far more limited than our own; Cheney {\&} Seyfarth 1990; Whiten 1991

one would expect that humans would have a specialized computational device-an implicit 'theory of human nature'-that models what motivations and mental representations others would develop when placed in various evolutionarily recurrent situations

Not only does it facilitate the growth of co-operation, but it also lengthens the reach of extortive threat and makes revenge possible. This is because the argument about collateral benefits applies symmetrically to collateral injury (Tooby {\&} Cosmides 1984, 1989)

To influence each other in a well- calibrated way, animals must be able to accurately estimate the costs and benefits of an action to self and others, and to predict what actions others will take in the absence of a contingently provided benefit (see, e.g., Cosmides {\&} Tooby 1989, on baselines)

A key computational component is the ability to map the world of costs and benefits according to the psychology of a potential exchange partner (or antagonist), and to judge whether its beneficial (or harmful) acts were 'intentional'-

narrow exchange contingency does not capture the phenomenology or indeed the phenomenon of friendship We propose that the altruistic adaptations that underlie friendship do not map onto the structure of tit for tat or any other standard model of reciprocal altruism based on alternating sequences of contingent favours. 

If we conceptualize contingent benefit-benefit interactions as social exchange (rather than more narrowly as reciprocation), then individuals rendering assistance can be seen as facing a series of choices about when to extend credit and to whom

Computational adaptations designed to regulate such decisions should
certainly take into account whether an individual will be willing to repay in the future (i.e., are they a cheater?). But they should also assess whether the person will be in a position to repay (i.e., are they a good credit risk?), and whether the terms of exchange will be favourable (will this exchange partnership ultimately prove more profitable than the alternatives it will preclude?)

Yet selection would seem to favour decision rules that caused others to desert you exactly when your need for help was greatest. This recurrent predicament constituted a grave adaptive problem for our ancestors-a problem whose solution would be strongly favoured if one could be found. What design features might contribute to the solution of this problem?

If Banker's Paradox dilemmas had been a selection pressure, then one
would expect to see adaptations that caused humans to: 

1 have an appetite to be recognized and valued for their individuality
or exceptional attributes; 

2 be motivated to notice what attributes they have that others value
but cannot obtain as easily elsewhere; 

3 be motivated to cultivate specialized skills, attributes, and habitual
activities that increase their relative irreplaceability; 

4 be motivated to lead others to believe that they have such attributes; 

5 preferentially seek, cultivate, or maintain social associations and participate in social groups where their package of valued attributes is most indispensable, because what they can differentially offer is what others differentially lack; 

6 preferentially avoid social circles in which what they can offer is not
valued or is easily supplied by others; and, 

7 be jealous or rivalrous when someone within their social circle develops abilities to confer similar types of benefits, or when someone with similarly valued attributes enters their social circle

Much of social life seems to consist of a continual movement to find and occupy individualized niches that are unusually other-benefitting but hard to imitate, accompanied by a shuffling of social associations in search of configurations where the parties are most highly mutually valued

Indeed, the cross-culturally general motivation for status (as opposed to dominance) is arguably a product, in some measure, of this kind of selection pressure. Calling someone irreplaceable, or stressing how they will be (or have been) missed is a ubiquitous form of praise

The motivation to discover and occupy unique niches of valued individuality is facilitated by the many forces that act to spontaneously locate individuals in unique 'starting positions'

These include, obviously, the fact that each individual's talents and shortcomings will be somewhat different due to random genetic variation, the accidents of ontogeny, and the different kinship, demographic and social circumstances they are born into.

One might expect selection for adaptations that guide an individual not only to hone those skills that she can do well in an absolute sense, but to put special effort into those skills that she does relatively well, so that she 'product-differentiates' herself. 

Indeed, the most common and basic meaning humans apply to the issue of ability-acquisition is a social meaning-ability relative to others-rather than an absolute standard. Competences that everyone shares are not even noticed.

Of course, the most ecologically valid evidence is what people actually do when you are genuinely in trouble. One would expect that assistance received in such times would be far more computationally meaningful, and cause a far greater change in attitude toward the giver than assistance rendered at other times

Phenomenologically, individuals seem to be deeply moved at such times, find such acts deeply memorable, and often subsequently feel compelled to communicate that they will never forget who helped them

Safer, more stable modern environments may, therefore, be leaving people in genuine and uncharacteristically protracted doubt as to the nature of their relationships, and whether anyone is deeply engaged in their welfare

Because of the lack of clarifying events, an individual may have many apparently warm social contacts, and yet feel lonely, uneasy, and hungry for the confident sensation of deep social connectedness that people who live in environments that force deep mutual dependence routinely enjoy

Although there are other kinds of cues, the basic structure of the
clarifying event our minds are designed to monitor is one in which a particular individual has the opportunity to help, and that help would be of great value to the recipient. 

If they fail to help you when such help would be a deliverance, and the cost to them would not have been prohibitive, then it is a mistake to waste one of your scarce friendship niches on them

Their level of commitment is revealed by the magnitude of the cost they are willing to incur per unit of benefit they are willing to deliver. Although there are many other variables that are important-such as how alert they are for opportunities to help, and how effective they can be at helping-the presence of deep engagement is a key variable


1 Number of slots already filled. Adaptations should be designed to
compute how many individuals in one's social world are deeply engaged in one's welfare, and how much uncertainty there is in this computation. If the number is high, then other factors, such as efficiency in exchange relationships or short run return to investment, might be weighted more heavily. If the number is low, or the individual is uncertain about the commitment of her friends, then adaptations should motivate counter- measures: activities that increase the likelihood of friend recruitment or consolidation should become more appealing

It will be advantageous to be a high quality associate, and SO individuals should feel a spontaneous pleasure in discovering effective ways of helping their friends, without looking for any contingent return. Instead of being cheated, the primary risk is experiencing a world increasingly devoid of deeply engaged social partners, or sufficiently beneficial social partners, or both

Adaptations should be designed to respond to signs of waning affection by increasing the desire to be liked, and mobilizing changes that will bring it about

Of course, this requires mutual communication and the ability to detect when someone truly values you (in which deception is certainly possible). But against a background of impoverished social options, it might not take much of an initial asymmetric valuation to get such a mirror relationship running and mutually reinforcing

Meaningful alternative models of the evolution of altruism might be developed by looking at the delivery of energy, or survival through high- risk episodes, or what might be called agency altruism-increasing the ability of other agents to take effective action

By moving beyond the classical definition of altruism, which requires a fitness cost to the deliverer and a fitness benefit to the recipient, evolutionarily oriented researchers can con- struct a much richer family of models of altruism which may better account for the diverse array of altruistic adaptations in humans and other species},

emerges in culture-specific ways because we believe that culture shapes how and when such rationalization occurs. We base our argument on the conceptualization of cogni- tive dissonance as part of a self-image maintenance process (Spencer, Josephs, {\&} Steele, 1993; Steele et al., 1993)

self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988):
people tend to experience threats to their self-concepts and the concomitant arousal of cognitive dissonance to the extent that they sense the possibility of having made a less-than-optimal choice. However, because different cultures espouse different self- construals or self-views as their cultural ideals (Heine et al., 1999; Markus {\&} Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1989, 1996), there should be cross-cultural variability in the processes of cognitive dissonance and self-image maintenance.

In particular, we believe that cognitive dissonance is experienced whenever people's important self- concepts are threatened, but dissonance reduction depends on the particular nature of important self-concepts espoused in a given culture.

Self-concepts and decision making:
Optimal Western decision making should appear to be rational, unique, and independent, expressing individuals' own preferences and desires.

Sensing the possibility of having made an irrational choice or having made a decision influenced by others, for instance, could induce Western- ers to feel that their culturally ideal self-concepts are threatened

sense that their self-integrity is damaged and, consequently, to justify their choices as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance

interdependent self-view, tend to attach greater importance to smooth and harmonious interpersonal relationships with their in-group members

Optimal East Asian decision making should incorporate and reflect the preferences and desires of close in-group members and can be construed as a sign of good membership in that society

Individuals espousing interdependent self-concepts as their cul-
tural ideal find making a suboptimal decision for themselves much less threatening than making an inconsiderate decision for their in-group members

Such an undesirable decision can have impli- cations for maintaining harmonious relationships and may increase interpersonal concerns. It could also become a source of cognitive dissonance to the extent that the decision threatens the mainte- nance of a culturally adaptive self-image as an individual sensitive and sensible to the needs of in-group members

Thus, interdepen- dent East Asians are expected to justify their decisions when they fear they might have made interpersonally inconsiderate decisions, which can have various implications for their relationships with in-group members, and not when they have made suboptimal decisions for themselves, which affect only the decision makers alone.

"Westerners experience dissonance when they have made an individually costly choice; Easterners experience dissonance when they have made a group-costly decision?"

self-affirmation theory suggests that people are motivated to maintain an image of self-integrity. When a negative event threat- ens their beliefs that they are morally adequate and adaptive, individuals try to restore their positive self-images by affirming some positive, valuable aspects of their self-concepts

When people feel threatened by a nagging feeling that they have made a foolish decision, they can be af- firmed by reminding themselves of some personally important values, such as religious beliefs

he char- acteristics of independent Western self-concepts that are likely to contribute to effective self-affirmation tend to reinforce people's beliefs in their individual uniqueness or distinctiveness from other people

the self-affirming characteristics of interdepen- dent East Asian self-concepts tend to reinforce a strong sense of connectedness or belongingness with important in-group members

PAST RESEARCH
Heine and Lehman (1997) demonstrated in cross-cultural differences in dissonance reduction between North Americans and East Asians: FREE-CHOICE PARADIGM

- Canadians showed the usual justification of their choices of CDs as a means of reducing dissonance. In keeping with the tenets of self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988; Steele et al., 1993), Canadian participants did not justify their decisions when provided with an opportunity to affirm themselves through positive feedback on a personality test

- Their Japanese counterparts, by contrast, did not show a tendency to justify their choices of CDs, and thus, for these participants, the self-affirmation manipulation turned out to be meaningless.

if Japanese participants did not experi- ence cognitive dissonance in choosing between comparably rated CDs, they should also not have felt any threat to their self-integrity and, thus, had no need to restore their positive self-images by affirming themselves

Japanese participants did not rationalize their decisions because East Asians do not experience cognitive dissonance in the conventional free-choice paradigm

Appealing to core differences between the North American independent self-view and the East Asian interdependent self-view, they suggested that cognitive dissonance was a culturally constructed phenomenon specific to North American culture. In other words, making a nonoptimal choice for the self is threatening if one has an independent, but not an interdependent, self-view

Sakai's (1981; Sakai{\&}Andow, 1980) earlier research with an induced compliance paradigm demonstrated contrasting results with East Asian samples: He found that those who made the speech publicly showed significant attitude change (i.e., higher endorsement of the abolition of coeducation) than those who made the speech anonymously. 

Anticipating a counterargument from the audience, the students making a public speech became aware of the inconsistency between their private opinion in support of coeducation and the public speech endorsing its abolition, which led them to experience cognitive dissonance.

We believe that the inconsistent results are due not to the different paradigms used, but rather to differences in the nature of the self being threatened in those two situations.

Revealing such personal identification raised concerns about potential disagreement, ridicule, personal attack, or ostracism from the would-be audience, which might include friends or classmates.

STUDIES: Unconventional Free-Choice Paradigm

a situation in which the experimental task creates interpersonal concerns and has implications for inter- dependent self-concepts,

For East Asians, knowing the preferences and anticipating the desires of close in-group members are important aspects of inter- personal relationships

Failing to meet these cultural standards might not only hurt the others' feelings and thereby harm close interpersonal relationships, but also make the decision maker feel incompetent

Such a situation could create interpersonal concerns and thereby threaten the self-integrity of and lead to dissonance arousal for East Asians

We therefore created the “friend” condition, in which participants were asked to evaluate a set of objects on the basis of their close friends' preferences and choose between two object alternatives as a gift for their close friends.

STUDY 1:
European Canadians showed significant postdecisional justification when they made choices for themselves. We also replicated past findings and found that Asian Canadians did not engage in postdecisional justification when they made choices for themselves. 

Asian Canadians tended to engage in postdecisional justification when they made choices for their close friends. On the other hand, European Canadians' postdecisional justification of their choices made for their friends was less than that of choices made for themselves and less than Asian Canadians' justification of the choices made for their friends

STUDY 2: replication
In summary, the study had a 2 (cultural group: European Canadians vs. Japanese) ? 2 (target of coupon choice: self vs. friend) between-subjects factorial design.


As mentioned earlier, there is evidence that North Americans do experience dissonance interpersonally or vicariously when they observe their in-group members engage in attitude-inconsistent behavior (Norton et al., 2003)

The most plausible interpretation at this point seems to be that although they care about their choices made for their close friends to a certain extent, they are more concerned about their personal choices than their interpersonal choices.
Study


Study 3: 
Postdecisional Justification and Self-Affirmation Among Asian Canadians:
In a third study, we investigated the effect of self-affirmation as a means of countering cognitive dissonance in the friend condition among Asian-born Asian Canadians who strongly identified with Asian culture.

Self-affirmation:
Postdecisional justification is not the only route to restoring self- integrity: Past cognitive dissonance research has demonstrated that self- affirmation buffers threats and reduces defensiveness in the expe- rience of cognitive dissonance and that it can be used as an alternative means to postdecisional justification to alleviate disso- nance arousal and maintain one's self-image (Heine {\&} Lehman, 1997; Steele {\&} Liu, 1983; Steele et al., 1993)

We used both independent and interdependent self-affirmation manipulations and a no self-affirmation control group. We expected that only the interdependent self-affirmation would be effective

effective as an alternative to justifying their choices for Asian Canadians because this self-affirmation manipulation would pro- vide them with an opportunity to maintain their cultural ideals even when confronting the feelings of threatened self-integrity tied to the prospect of choosing the wrong gift coupons for important in-group members.

Thus, we expected that when choosing cou- pons for their close friends, Asian Canadians presented with an opportunity to affirm their interdependent selves would not show postdecisional justification, whereas those who did not have such an opportunity would continue to engage in postdecisional justification.

Newly Devised Self-Affirmation Manipulations:
To affirm these cultural ideals, we asked participants under an interdependent self- affirmation manipulation to select the most important value for themselves and their families and explain the reasons why they and their families share that particular value.

we revised the conventional self-affirmation manipulation to create an independent self-affirmation manipulation that provides people with a more salient opportunity to affirm their uniqueness and indepen- dence. Specifically, under the new independent self-affirmation manipula- tion, participants explained why their selected values uniquely describe who they are.},

Paradoxically, a segment of current mainstream cultural anthropology has more or less abandoned culture as a topic.

Parallel signalling models in economics are discussed. Interpretations of the handicap principle are compared.

abstract = {Honest signalling assumes a correlation between an observable signal and a nonobservable quality. There are many mutually nonexclusive mechanisms that can achieve such a correlation; however, for a long time the handicap principle has been identified as the main solution to this problem. In short, it claims that signals need to be costly to be honest and that honest signallers have to pay this extra cost at the equilibrium (i.e. signals have to be handicaps). Honesty, however, is not maintained by the realized cost paid by honest signallers at the equilibrium but by the potential cost of cheating. Whether this potential cost implies a realized cost for honest signallers depends on the biological details of the system and thus this cost cannot be predicted a priori without knowledge of these details. Accordingly, depending on these details, signals need not be costly to be honest, even under conflict of interest. In other words, handicapping equilibrium signals are not the only way to create a high potential cost of cheating. Here I first review the theoretical models supporting the above conclusion, and then I list mechanisms that can maintain a high potential cost of cheating without imposing extra realized cost (i.e. a handicap) on honest signallers at the equilibrium. Identifying and describing those constraints or the lack of them that might create a connection between these two types of cost should be a major research agenda. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

@article{Simpson2007,
annote = {What makes trust particularly difficult to study is that it involves three com- ponents (e.g., ‘‘I trust you to do X''; Hardin, 2003).

Kramer and Carnevale (2001) argue that trust involves a set of beliefs and expectations that a partner's actions will be beneficial to one's long-term self-interest, especially in situations in which the partner must be counted on to provide unique benefits or valuable outcomes

Trust-relevant situations typically activate two cognitive processes: 
(a) feelings of vulnerability; and 
(b) expectations of how the partner is likely to behave across time, particularly in strain-test situations

When the partner promotes the individual's best interests rather than his or her own, both parties should experience heightened trust. 

Trust is also likely to be higher in a relationship when 
(a) each member's self-interested outcomes match those that are best for their partner or the relationship, or 
(b) both members believe that their partner will act on what is best for the relationship even when the members' personal self-interests diverge.

Kelley et al. (2003) claim that trust can be assessed in certain interpersonal situations:

high interdependence (such that the actions of each partner strongly impact the other), a blend of rules for coordi- nation and exchange that sustain interdependence, and mod- erately corresponding interests (see Kelley et al., 2003, for further details).

Dispositionally oriented work has revealed that individuals who are more in- securely attached, have lower self-esteem, or have more poorly differentiated self-concepts (i.e., self-concepts that are less di- versified, more imbalanced, and poorly tied together) trust their relationship partners less (see Simpson, 2007, for a review)

Interpersonally oriented work has confirmed that trust is typi- cally higher when individuals believe their partners are more committed to the relationship and have more benevolent in- tentions and motivations

It is also higher when partners regu- larly display prorelationship transformations of motivation (that is, turn initial gut-level negative reactions to caustic partner behaviors into constructive responses that benefit the relation- ship), which then generate self-sacrificial or accommodative behaviors

involves a process of uncertainty reduction as individuals move from having confidence in their partner's general predictability to having confidence in their prorelationship values, motives, goals, and intentions (Holmes {\&} Rempel, 1989)

four core principles of interpersonal trust

1. individuals gauge the degree to which they can trust
their partners by observing whether partners display proper transformation of motivation in trust-diagnostic situations (that is, in trust or strain-test situations in which partners make de- cisions that go against their own personal self-interest and support the best interests of the individual or the relationship)

2. trust-diagnostic situations often occur naturally and unintentionally during the ebb and flow of everyday life. Depending on situational circumstances, however, individuals may enter, transform, or occasionally create trust-diagnostic situations to test whether their current level of trust in a partner is warranted.

3. Individual differences in attachment orientations, self-
esteem, or self-differentiation (i.e., working models of self and others as relationship partners) should affect the growth or de- cline of trust over time in relationships. People who are more securely attached, have higher self-esteem, or have more differentiated self-concepts should be more likely to experience trust as well as increases in trust in relationships across time

4. Neither the level nor the trajectory of trust in relationships can be fully understood without considering the dispositions and actions of both relationship partners, especially in trust-diagnostic situations

In Study 2, chronically avoidant students (but not others) in a methods class preferred to have their teacher assign them to working groups (a nondiagnostic situation) over forming their own groups (a diagnostic situation).

However, they remain poorly understood and conceptualized in scientific terms. Here, we provide first steps towards a theory of collective emotions. We first review accounts of the social and cultural embeddedness of emotion that contribute to understanding collective emotions from three broad perspectives: face-to-face encounters, culture and shared knowledge, and identification with a social collective. In discussing their strengths and shortcomings and highlighting areas of conceptual overlap, we translate these views into a number of bottom–up mechanisms that explain collective emotion elicitation on the levels of social cognition, expressive behavior, and social practices.},

the synchronous convergence in affective responding across individuals towards a specific event or object.

1. role of emotion expression in face-to-face encounters, assuming that physical proximity promotes emotional contagion between individuals.

2. we review research arguing that culture and shared knowledge let individuals assign similar meanings to emotionally relevant events, thus leading to a shared emotion culture

3. we discuss works arguing that group membership and social identity elicit a specific class of emotions in response to events affecting one's group


FACE-TO-FACE ENCOUNTERS
Le Bon (1895), who was interested in how synchrony in cognitions, emotions, and behaviors emerges in crowds.

Le Bon explained the emergence of this synchrony by analogy to the spreading of disease: He held that cognitive and affective states can be infectious under certain circumstances and that they spread by contagion:

nonverbal contagion in dyads and small groups. 
Hatfield, Cacioppo, and Rapson (1992, p. 153f) define emotional contagion as the

“tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize facial expressions, vocaliza- tions, postures, and movements with those of another person and, consequently, to converge emotionally.”

importance of motor mimicry and imitation.

Moreover, in reviewing evidence on facial, vocal, and postural mimicry, they highlight that afferent feedback generated by these motor processes (as marshaled by the facial feedback hypothesis) is a major determinant of emotional experience and probably also a crucial component of emotional conta- gion.


From contagion to shared emotions: the need for mutual recognition of group norms? 

Collins (2004) has extended Durkheim's account in his theory of inter- action ritual chains, in which physical copresence and the “mutual entrainment of emotion and attention” produce “a shared emotional/cognitive experience” (Collins, 2004, p. 48).

Collins adds to Durkheim's approach a precise microsociologi- cal account of how mutual entrainment evolves and how the acquired emotional energy can be understood as a socially stratifying resource.

expressive behavior and contagion are vital ingredi- ents to collective emotions understood as affective convergence

Although studies on emotional contagion give insights into the physiological processes underlying the transmission of emotion and emphasize the role of immediate social contextual factors, they are somewhat mute on the effects of the more general social and cultural embeddedness

group properties are systematically implicated in generating effervescence in rituals, although the exact pathways remain unexplored.


CULTURE AND SHARED KNOWLEDGE
common interpretative strategies and normative expectations contribute to socially shared emotions. 

commonalities within groups of individuals and certain group properties rather than the importance of physical proximity, 

and focus on a general tendency of group members to react emotionally in similar ways, have comparable affective dispositions, and belong to the same emotion culture

similarities are hypothesized to occur due to 
(a) exposure to identical eliciting events; 
(b) regular interactions with other group members and mutual influence on each other's appraisals; 
(c) the sharing of common values and norms; 
(d) identification as group members and appraisals of group-relevant events; and 
(e) patterns of emotional behavior seen as constitutive for group membership (Parkinson et al., 2005)

A number of studies have substantiated the existence of group emotions according to some of these cri- teria (e.g., Barsade {\&} Gibson, 1998), although some of them go under the labels “group affective tone” or “affective team composition” (cf. Kelly {\&} Barsade, 2001)

there is a shift towards the symbolic and cultural properties of collectives, for example norms, practices, and ideologies. 

For instance, Bar-Tal's (2001) concept of collective emotional orientation refers to the ten- dency of a society to express a particular emotion, for example a “collective fear orientation”

these socially shared emotions are not just an aggregation of individual emotions, but represent “unique holistic” qualities of social collectives (Bar-Tal, 2001, p. 605).

de Rivera (1992), who introduced the concepts of 
emotional atmosphere - reactions of a group when focusing on a common event, such as despair when losing an armed conflict
emotional climate - constituted by the enduring emotional quality of the relationships individuals within a society have with each other, for example when relationships are characterized by fear (e.g., in a totalitarian state).
emotional culture - refers to long-term social and cultural practices, norms, and ideologies regarding the experience and expression of emotions. Once internalized, these symbolic frameworks guide and “calibrate” the emotions of many individuals.

The shaping of emotions has been shown for 
different institutional settings (Turner, 2007), 
stratified groups (Collett {\&} Lizardo, 2010), 
gender (Simon {\&} Nath, 2004), 
race (Harvey Wingfield, 2010), 
identity (Stets, 2005), and
culture (Heise, 2010). 

Cross-cultural psychology has argued along the same lines, as shown, for instance, by Nisbett and Cohen (1996) in their study on the “culture of honor” in the southern United States

In sum, works referring to culture and shared knowledge contribute to an understanding of collective emotions based on enduring and stable cultural and structural properties of a group.

prompts the question: how socially shared knowledge and face-to-face processes mutually interact in generating emotional convergence. 

Until now, we have mainly reviewed research considering group properties and shared cog- nitions from an aggregate, top–down perspective, paying less attention to the role of social identification

IDENTIFICATION WITH A SOCIAL COLLECTIVE
the pro- found effects of self-categorization and social identity and suggests the existence of group-based emotions

Social categorization refers to the tendency to perceive the self as a member of a socially defined group or category

Social identity is defined as the knowledge of belonging to certain social groups and an emotional significance that goes along with membership in a group (Tajfel, 1981).

Correspondingly, group-based emotions are conceived of as emotions felt by individuals on behalf of a social collective or other members of a collective (Smith, 1993)

Kessler and Hollbach (2005, p. 677) emphasize “distinctive feature between individual and group-based emotions is that individual emotions are elicited by events concerning one's personal identity whereas group-based emotions are elicited by events concerning one's social identity as a member of a particular group.”

These intergroup emotion theories postulate “that when people identify with a group, they will appraise social objects or events in terms of their implications for the group” (Smith {\&} Mackie, 2006, p. 174)

Importantly, group-based emotions can be elicited in solitude, for example when other mem- bers of an in-group perform favorable or unfavorable actions or are ascribed certain qualities by third parties—as in cases of collective guilt (Branscombe, 2004)—and do not require effervescence or contagion in physical proximity

In summary, group-based emotion theory contributes to an understanding of collective emotions based on a “nonaggregate” perspective on group properties
emotions resulting from social identification are supposed to be qualitatively different from those elicited by shared beliefs and values.

Nevertheless, they clearly contribute to emotional convergence and add a further dimension to approaches relying on culture and socially shared knowledge.


MECHANISMS OF EMOTIONAL CONVERGENCE: Social Cognition, behaviour in social interaction, {\&} social practices and normative order

Social Appraisal and Collective Intentions

Appraisal Models: emotion elicitation is initiated by appraising situations, acts, or events based on individual cognitions such as goals, beliefs, and desires (Lazarus {\&} Smith, 1988).

Appraisal models have been extended to include social appraisals, which explicitly account for the social embeddedness of the appraisal process (Manstead {\&} Fischer, 2001; Parkinson, 2001):

one person's appraisals are often influenced by others' emotions and appraisals, either by way of sharing emotions and appraisals (Rim{\'{e}}, 2009) or by witnessing corresponding emotional reactions (Manstead {\&} Fischer, 2001)

(a) socially distributed in that relevant appraisal-input comes from other actors (Oatley, 2000); as 
(b) socially learned by adopting appraisals of various socialization agents (Manstead {\&} Fischer, 2001); or as 
(c) a process of legitimizing and support- ing one's appraisals by reference to the appraisals of others (Manstead {\&} Fischer, 2001)

THIS IS BEGINNING TO SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE LIT?

Groups provide appraisal orienting guidelines, primarily via norms and values

We add to this view by arguing for the social constitution and sharing of the beliefs, desires, and various forms of tacit and declarative knowledge underlying appraisals.

cognitive sociology which has repeatedly pointed out that social collectives are—inter alia—defined by a high degree of overlap in individuals' cognitions, motivations, and social representations (Zerubavel, 1997) which, according to appraisal theories, are crucial in eliciting emotions

socially shared cognitive appraisal structures can be seen as one part of the cognitive foundations of collective emotions by contributing to the align- ment or “calibration” of emotions within collectives (e.g., von Scheve, 2012).

the importance of the collective intentions in the coordination of social action. More recently, these accounts have been related to the explanation of collective emotions (Huebner, 2011; Salmela, 2012).

emotions elicited on the basis of collective intentional states or collective concerns (e.g., goals, intentions) are qualitatively different from emotions elicited by private, individual intentions (Salmela, 2012)

1. Aggregate accounts argue that collective intentional states exist if a sufficiently large number of members of a social collective intend or believe that something is or should be the case.

collective intention is considered the sum of its individual parts, in much the same way as Barsade and Gibson (1998) define group emotion as the sum of its parts

On the other hand, 2. “nonaggregate” accounts pinpoint collectivity in intentions through members of a social group having certain intentions as members of that group, that is, by referring to intentional states of individuals directed at the group or existing “on behalf” of the group.

E.g. a theatre ensemble strives to perform exceptionally as an ensemble and not in a way in which each member performs exceptionally.

From this perspective, collectively intentional emotions represent the “togetherness” and mutual goal-directedness found in social collectives (Salmela, 2012).

Tuomela (2006) distinguishes summative forms of collectively intentional states from nonsummative forms by referring to the former as weak “We-mode” (or progroup “I-mode”) collectivity and to the latter as strong “We-mode” collectivity. 

Salmela (2012) has suggested distinguishing “I-mode” from “We-mode” collective emotions

(a) socially shared appraisal structures promote “I-mode” emotional convergence and 

(b) appraisals founded on joint, collectively intentional states based on the identification with a social collective foster the elicitation of “We-mode” collective emotions and, also, support emotional convergence.

Is this a fucntion of cost? Stag Hunt?

Expressive Behavior and Facial Dialects
it has been argued that joint attention in social encounters is a prerequisite for collective intentionality to emerge (Tomasello {\&} Carpenter, 2007)

Two (interlinked) lines of argument are conceivable: 

1. the assumption that these processes can support the emergence or stabilize preexisting shared appraisal structures and collective intentions. (in the case of synchrony, for example?)

The first option corresponds to and specifies the key function attributed to collective effervescence by authors such as Durkheim (1912) and Collins (2004), that is, the contribution of emotional contagion to the affective grounding of the beliefs and values of a group.

Facial expressions not only make visible the affective consequences of situational appraisals, but also allow individuals in face-to-face encounters as well as in mediated interactions to make inferences about the cognitions that caused an emotion.

SIGNALING:

when two or more individuals mutually perceive convergence in emotional responding, it is plausible that they also infer similarities in underlying values and beliefs that caused an emo- tion and possibly also in the degree of commitment to these val- ues and beliefs, depending on the perceived “authenticity” of an expression.

In line with the arguments of Durkheim and Collins, the mutual attribution of shared motives and cognitive struc- tures may well foster the formation of groups and group identification and—extending their arguments—“We-mode” collective intentions

we suggest that facial expressions in assemblies, crowds, or masses contribute to the formation of social collectives, which in turn have independent effects on the elicitation and quality of collective emotions





2. the conjecture that cultural embeddedness shapes and fine-tunes nonverbal behavior and makes contagion more effective within, rather than across, groups.

The second option proposes that face-to-face processes are fine-tuned to distinct social collectives, meaning that they evolve in adaptation to the cultural environment (von Scheve, 2012).

social calibration of emotional expression rests on the assumption that facial expression exhibits marked social plasticity. Given the existence of “facial dialects” in expression and recognition (Elfenbein, Beaupr{\'{e}}, L{\'{e}}vesque, {\&} Hess, 2007), it is plausible to assume that these dialects also influence emotional contagion, which is based on rapid and nonconscious imitation of expressive behavior and thus on rec- ognition and decoding abilities.

This justifies the conjecture that contagion as a precursor of emotional convergence is more effective within, rather than across, social groups and depends on individuals' relative familiarity with the dominant dialects of expressive behavior.

Collective emotions in face-to-face encounters might thus arise more easily when individuals share the same expressive dialects. Although the proposed linkages are theoretically plausible, there is hardly any evidence as yet to support our claims.


Hypothesis 1:
that similar expressive behaviors in face-to-face situations promote the perception of similarities in emotion- generating cognitions and appraisals, which in turn support and amplify “I-mode” and potentially also “We-mode” collective emotions.

Hypothesis 2: 
Secondly, facial dialects and the calibration of expres- sion to a group's cultural environment increase the likelihood of contagion-based emotional convergence within existing groups rather than across group boundaries



Collective Memory and Social Norms
But social collec- tives transcend individual cognition and behavior in generating symbolic and normative orders of meaning making that are expressed and negotiated through, for example, social institu- tions, practices, discourse, and the arts.

At the most basic level, group membership heightens the probability of exposure to, or being involved in, identical emo- tionally relevant events (Parkinson et al., 2005)

Collective memories may contribute to emotion elicitation in much the same way as individual memories do, albeit with the resulting emotions being most probably qualitatively different

In contrast to (group-based) emotions, sentiments are enduring and mood-like affective dispositions or “emotional attitudes” (Oatley, 2000) which are directed towards in- or out-groups, such as feelings of belonging, solidarity, hos- tility, or resentment.

Group-based sentiments therefore constitute important precursors of collective emotions.

Interestingly, social norms target vari- ous kinds of behaviors—including the experience and expres- sion of emotions, in both a prescriptive and a descriptive way. Feeling and display rules (Hochschild, 1979) demarcate the social appropriateness and expectedness of emotional behavior

Since they are tied to informal sanctions, feeling and display rules constitute mechanisms for the social control of emotions and thus clearly foster emotional congruence within groups

Representing and communicating emotional experience through language is an important means of negotiating and ensuring emotional responding towards spe- cific events. In social interaction, this contributes to the inter- personal “validation” of appropriate emotions and “ideal affect” (Tsai, 2007) within social collectives.

In other representational formats, for example artworks, mass media, or advisory books, cultural conceptions of what is usually felt or should be felt are disseminated to large numbers of recipients, which in turn may promote the elicitation of collective emotions.


To summarize our view on the symbolic foundations of collective emotions, we emphasize four key mechanisms:

1. group membership contributes to the formation of collective memories through discourse, which promote long-term emotional convergence; 

2. Enduring group-based sentiments dispositionally influence the elicitation of valence-congruent collective emotions; 

3. social norms contribute to the elicitation of collective emotions as shared components of appraisals and as mechanisms of the social control of emotion; and

4. Cultural practices contribute to the large-scale dissemination and validation of appropriate and expected feelings

CONCLUSION:

We have defined collective emotions as synchronous convergence in affective responding across indi- viduals towards a specific event or object. This view does not necessarily presuppose that collective emotions are qualita- tively different from individual emotions and that convergence is established exclusively in face-to-face encounters. In its most basic form, this definition does not even presuppose or require mutual awareness of others' emotions.

individuals have to appraise an event in similar ways, which in turn requires a minimum of shared appraisal structures or shared concerns and leads to convergence in emotional responding.

These basic forms of collective emotions are subject to two key processes that alter elicitation probabilities and qualitative aspects. 

1. One is mutual awareness of others' expressive behaviors and feelings, either in physical proximity through nonverbal modalities or through mediated channels and verbal communication.

Physical proximity may substantially amplify and reinforce convergence by way of facial mimicry and conta- gion, and verbal communication contributes to the symbolic transmission of appraisal outcomes and the descriptive labeling of emotions.

2. widely shared appraisal structures within existing social collectives. 

Membership in a collective usually goes hand in hand with the sharing of certain beliefs and values, along with patterns of interaction and common perceptions of relevant events.

groups and collectives are the point of reference for social identity and therefore contribute to emotional convergence by way of group-based emotions.

Similarly, members of existing groups with shared cogni- tions and intentions engaging in social interaction profit from the social calibration of facial expression which probably makes contagion more effective within, rather than across, social groups. 

Importantly, transitions from “I-mode” to “We-mode” collective emotions are not confined to face-to-face gatherings.

Although copresence makes others' emotions particularly sali- ent through multimodal channels, various forms of group- and culture-specific communication and repre},

Some past research has examined the effect of hazing on hazees, but no experimental work has been performed to examine the motivational causes of hazing. This paper has two primary objectives. First, it synthesizes a century of theory on severe initiations and extracts three primary explanatory themes. Second, it examines the dynamics of enduring human coalitions to generate an evolutionary theory of hazing. Two laboratory experiments suggest that one potential function of hazing is to reduce newcomers' ability to free ride around group entry.

abstract = {The apparent wastefulness of religious ritual represents a puzzle for rational choice theorists and evolutionary scholars. In recent years, it has been proposed that such rituals represent costly signals that promote intragroup cooperation precisely because of the effort and resources they require. This hypothesis was tested over the course of a 14-month long ethnographic study in the northeast of Brazil. The research focused on adherents of Candombl??, an African diasporic religion organized in autonomous congregations primarily located in low-income urban areas. Individuals who reported higher levels of religious commitment behaved more generously in a public goods economic game and revealed more instances of provided and received cooperation within their religious community. This suggests that ritual as a costly signaling may effectively predict willingness to cooperate with other group members and that the signaler may accrue benefits in the form of received cooperation. Socioeconomic variables are also shown to mediate religious signaling. This raises the possibility that signalers strategically alter their expressions of commitment as their needs and circumstances change. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

more concerned with adaptationist explanations that center on the relationship between ritual and prosociality (e.g., Alcorta {\&} Sosis, 2005; Bering {\&} Johnson, 2005; Bulbulia, 2004b; Cronk, 1994; Irons, 1996 2001; Johnson {\&} Bering, 2006; Sosis {\&} Bressler, 2003; Sosis, 2003; Sosis {\&} Ruffle, 2003, 2004; Wilson, 2002; see also Pyysi{\"{a}}inen {\&} Hauser, 2010; Sosis, 2001)

Costly Signaling:
Sexual selection: only individuals in truly good condition will be able to bear the costs of the signal without sacrificing other aspects of their fitness. Signalers benefit because their advertisements make them attractive as mates, while receivers stand to gain reliable information about the sender's quality

efficacy and strategic costs of signals aimed at obtaining a response from a
receiver (Dawkins, 1993; Guilford {\&} Dawkins, 1991).

- Efficacy Costs: energetic and opportunity costs endured by the sender to produce a signal that is discernible to a potential receiver and the increased predation risk associated with being more noticeable. Every signal carries some efficacy costs.

Costly signals are different because they exceed this minimum threshold and require an additional investment (i.e., strategic cost) from the sender in order to produce an extravagant trait or behavior that is hard to fake

In a given population, individuals will be present in a continuum of lowest to highest quality signalers whose ability to afford strategic costs will result in a range of signal intensities. While these hard-to-fake signals can potentially be faked, the high costs involved it their production will deter free-riders from advertising falsely (this is in contrast to ‘indices', signals which cannot be faked because they are the direct result of an underlying attribute; Maynard-Smith {\&} Harper, 2003).

Since group members cannot directly evaluate each other's commitment, rituals that involve extensive time, effort or resources ensure that only those individuals who are truly devoted to the community and its shared ideas (that is, high-quality signalers) will find that benefits of group- belonging outweigh the costs of participation

Hard-to-fake rituals that advertised commitment to the religious group increased trust among members, facilitating the emergence of cooperation and collective action

Sosis School of costly signaling:
Like Irons, these researchers argue that ritual increases cooperation by providing an advertisement system that communicates the intensity of members' faith and thus solidarity toward the group.

Since group enterprises are vulnerable to free-riding, professions of commitment can be reliable only if they are accompanied by “credible signals of cooperative intentions that are costly-to-fake” (Sosis, 2003,p. 93).

Four conditions for evolutionarily stable costly signal:
1. members of a population vary with regard to an attribute that cannot be directly assessed but can be otherwise signaled;
2. it is advantageous for others to obtain reliable information about variation in attribute quality; 
3. there is a conflict of interest between signalers and receivers so that deception (i.e., signaling higher-than-actual quality) benefits signalers at the expense of receivers; and 
4. the costs of producing or performing the signal are condition-dependent (low-quality individuals pay higher costs to produce the signal, or, ceteris paribus, the benefits of signaling are greater for high-quality individuals)

Sosis: Religious ritual

1. Intensity of religious faith is a variable trait among members of a population that cannot be directly assessed but can be potentially signaled through ritual participation

2. Observers benefit from gaining information about this variation because religious faith is tied to group commitment and thus willingness to participate in cooperative exchanges with other group members

3. religious groups offer benefits in the form of intragroup cooperation which can be exploited by nonbelievers (i.e., low-quality signalers) who deceptively advertise religious faith

4. the opportunity costs of religious participation will be lower for believers (i.e., high-quality signalers) than for nonbelievers because the former have willingly changed or abandoned behaviors in order to comply with the religious doctrine, while the latter have not. Alternatively, if the benefits of group belonging are delayed, only true believers will be willing to engage in ritual participation long enough to receive them (see Sosis et al., 2007).

While it is not possible to directly measure feelings of commitment or solidarity, it is possible to assess levels of cooperation among group members

Sosis and Bressler (2003; see also Sosis, 2000) compared the longevity of religious and secular communes that existed in North America in the 19th and early 20th century. Their analyses showthat religious communes lasted longer and were less likely to dissolve than secular ones due to collective action failures (i.e., internal disputes or economic collapse)

religious communes imposed almost twice the number of costly requirements on members than secular ones, and increased number of costly requirements was positively correlated with commune longevityamong religious communities

Sosis and Ruffle (2003) further tested the relationship between hard-to-fake ritual and intragroup cooperation among members of religious and secular Israeli kibbutzim. They found that religious males, the only group required to engage in public ritual, cooperated more in an economic game than religious females and secular participants of both genders. only males who attended synagogue daily cooperated more than religious females and no differences were found between religious males who did not attend synagogue daily and religious females nor between secular males and females.

Research Setting:
The study focused on communities of Candombl{\'{e}}, an Afro-Brazilian religion that originated in the region in the 19th century and which has been the subject of considerable ethnographic work.

Candombl{\'{e}} religious centers, most commonly called terreiros (other terms are ax{\'{e}}, ro{\c{c}}a, casa, and simply candombl{\'{e}}) are usually located in low-income areas where Afro-Brazilians are overwhelmingly represented.

Worship is centered on the cult of the orix{\'{a}}s, deities that embody ax{\'{e}}, the life force of the universe.

Communication with these entities takes place through divination rituals and possession trance, an aspect of the religion that has received considerable attention (see Cohen, 2007, for a recent cognitive account).

Candombl{\'{e}}has apragmatic orientation, centrallyconcerned
with solving the problems of domestic existence and with helping adherents achieve health, prosperity and happiness

described as amoral (e.g., Chestnut, 2003)

Rather than vigilant deities that enforce moral norms and mete out punishment for ethical transgressions, orix{\'{a}}s can be swayed to advance one's interests through offerings and exchanges

Thus, the idea of moral gods that encourage prosociality through the threat of constant vigilance and punishment (e.g., Johnson {\&} Bering, 2006; Roes {\&} Raymond, 2003;Rossano, 2007) does not seemto apply in this context

Punishment from the orix{\'{a}}s is more likely to occur because of failure to perform the appropriate offering or ritual rather thanfor violating amoral norm.AsAmaral (2002) states, inCandombl{\'{e}}, “the only ‘sin', the only unforgivable error isnot properly worshipping the orix{\'{a}}s” (p. 63) (my translation).

Each terreiro is essentially an autonomous community led by the m{\~{a}}e-de-santo or ialorix{\'{a}} (“mother of the saint”) in the case of a woman or the pai-de-santo or babalorix{\'{a}} (“father of the saint”) in the less common case of a man.

Initiation into Candomble: an arduous process that requires periods of total seclusion and takes years to fully complete.

From my observations, however, the duration and intensity of initiation are highly dependent on the idiosyncrasy of the m{\~{a}}e-de-santo or pai-de-santo, size of the community, characteristics of the potential initiate and other factors

Many individuals first come to the terreiro seeking last-resort solutions to specific personal problems, including financial difficulties, troubled relationships, illnesses and addictions. The m{\~{a}}e-de-santo or pai-de-santo provides a consultation followed by a ritual course of treatment. Fees from these activities constitute the main source of revenue for the terreiro (recently, tourist attendance at large public feasts has also become a source of income).

Hypotheses
If ritual is indeed a hard-to-fake signal of commitment to the group, individuals that signal more intensely should also be more cooperative.

High-intensity signalers benefit because they are perceived as more reliable and thus may be more likely to be the recipients of cooperative exchanges.

On the other hand, signaling is beneficial to receivers because it provides information about the sender's cooperative intentions.

Predictions
(1) that Candombl{\'{e}} followers who score higher in the CRSS will cooperate more in the PGG and report higher instances of given cooperation toward other terreiro members; 
(2) that participants who score higher in the CRSS will report more instances of received cooperation from others in their group; and 
(3) because high levels of signalingare predictedtomotivate otherstodirect cooperation toward the signaler, that individuals who have potentially more to gain from belonging to the terreiro because of greater social or economic need will report higher scores in the CRSS

Methodology 

A preliminary database of 55 terreiros was constructedusing a combination of random sampling from an existing catalogue (Mott {\&} Cerqueira, 1998) and snowball sampling. This preliminary database was used to understand the variability present in the population of terreiros and to begin to identify potential sites for further research

a subsample of 14 terreiros was created for more detailed investigation

4.1. Data collection

I explained that participants would complete a three-part written questionnaire and then participate in an economic game played with real money.

Questionnaire:
The first part of the questionnaire focused on demographic
variables and questions that assessed various aspects of individual involvement with the terreiro. Categorical vari- ables (living or having lived at the terreiro, having relatives as fellowmembers of the terreiro, and marital status) were coded as dummy variables. 

The second part collected data on acts of cooperation among the terreiro community. This section was formulated through observations and interviews and con- sisted of a list of eight commonly occurring cooperative instances with yes/no responses

For example, the first set of items included “Have you ever lent money to someone in your terreiro?” and “Have you ever taken care of someone in your terreiro who was sick?” Positive responses to the first eight items were added to create the variable “given cooperation” (GCoop)

The variable “received cooperation” (RCoop) was created in the same way, but the questions were reversed to determine whether the respondent had ever received those same services.

The third part of the questionnaire consisted of a scale
created to measure costly signals of religiosity. Interviews were used to reveal aspects of the religion that participants deemed as costly or difficult. These data were collected on three dimensions commonly used in religiosity scales (see Mockabee et al., 2001): attendance, giving and participation.


Material for a 37-item preliminary scale was gathered
from progressively more detailed interviews and observations. Principal component analyses (varimax rotation) were used on the remaining items to determine which would be included in the final version of the scale. Items with loadings over .550 on a single factor were chosen for further consideration. 

Of those items, only those with means close to the center and high standard deviations were chosen. High variation is desirable because an item that is answered uniformly by most respondents will not reflect the differences in religiosity that the scale is intended to capture

The final version of the CRSS presented to study participants consisted of a 14-item scale (n=252). Reliability analysis of completed responses revealed high internal validity (Cronbach's $\alpha$=.875)

For the following analyses, completed scales with one missing response (n=21) were recoded using the person mean substitution method described by Downey and King (1998), where the mean of a person's completed responses substitutes the missing value.

Items “I never miss a feast at my terreiro” or “I come to the terreiro at least once a week” referred to the costliness of attendance since most devotees depend on public transportation which is expensive and inefficient

Participation, which requires both time and energy, was captured in items such as “I have spent a whole month at my terreiro because of an obriga{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o” (literally, “obligation”, meaning a compulsory religious event) or “Whenever my terreiro has a feast, I come at the beginning and stay until the end” (feasts can last several hours). Other items included “There are foods I cannot eat because of my orix{\'{a}}”, “I always have a candle lit for my orix{\'{a}}” (candles were often cited as a significant expense) and “I keep two or more days of resguardo a week” (resguardo refers to abstinence from alcohol, secular entertainment and sexual relationships) (full

RESULTS
Hypothesis 1: Individuals with higher scores on the CRSS will be more cooperative in the PGG and report more instances of past given cooperation to other terreiro members

Hypothesis 2: Individuals with higher scores on the CRSS will report having received more cooperation from their fellow terreiro members

Hypothesis 3: Individuals who have a greater need of belonging to the religious group will score higher on the CRSS

results show that hard-to-fake expressions of religiosity are related to measures of intragroup cooperation among Candombl{\'{e}} adherents. Controlling for various other variables, higher scores on a religiosity scale specifically designed for Candombl{\'{e}}, the CRSS, significantly predict game offer in an economic game and self-reported acts of cooperation toward other group members. In the case of the game, the amount of variation explained by the model is modest. However, it is notable that while CRSS score had a significant effect, other variables that may be expected to predict game offer did not (i.e., having relatives at the terreiro, years as a member of the terreiro, living or having lived at the terreiro)

- (GCoop), significant predictors include income, years as a member of the terreiro and living or having lived at the terreiro in addition to CRSS.

it is not possible to determine the role that tit-for-tat or indirect reciprocity play in the results, but it is likely that these mechanisms operate in conjunction with costly signaling (Milinski, Semmann {\&} Krambeck, 2002; Panchanathan {\&} Boyd, 2004).

Since high levels of costly signaling are related to received cooperation, there is a possibility of individuals

taking part in religious signaling in order to reap cooperative benefits and exiting the group when demands for reciprocity are made

Sosis (2003) argues that internalization of belief plays a crucial role in minimizing the risk of free- riding. Believers will perceive the opportunity costs of constant ritual participation as lower because they interpret their actions as important and meaningful, while skeptics will constantly struggle with the inconsistency between their beliefs and their required behavior.

Sosis proposes that the resulting cognitive dissonance will result in the skeptic either abandoning the group or, alternatively, adopting its beliefs.

Possession trance, a highly visible and dramatic event, might be a possible arena to investigate this idea. In Candombl{\'{e}} as in other religions, possession does not affect all individuals equally and it can occur in different contexts. It may be that possession episodes and other dramatic aspects of ritual are strategic signals intended to amplify audience effects.

The roles of receiver psychology and exploitation:

This study focused exclusively on variation in religious signaling among Candombl{\'{e}} adherents, but the question of why costly signaling appears to be effective in religious but not in secular communities remains open (see Sosis {\&} Bressler, 2003)},

abstract = {Most individual sport settings involve groups, as athletes often train in a team environment even though they compete individually and often in opposition to their teammates. Despite the pervasiveness of individual sport, group dynamics research has almost exclusively investigated team sports because team members rely on one another during the competitive group task. However, the reliance on task interdependence to dichotomize sport environments into one of two categories (i.e., team or individual) overlooks further differences in how members rely on each other (e.g., interdependence for individual and group-level outcomes or resources). The purpose of this article is to promote the investigation of group dynamics and social influence in individual sport by proposing a typology that distinguishes types of sport group environments according to levels of structural interdependence. This typology identifies six distinct sport team types and leads to a number of relevant theoretical and practice-based propositions. This work is a call for increased group dynamics research involving individual sport environments that acknowledges the multiple forms of interdependence that are present both in the group structure and the perceptions held by athletes.},

Some theorists would point to person factors in answering this question, specifying various personality dimensions as particularly relevant (see chaps. 3,4, 7, and 19, this volume). Others would take a social cognitive approach, emphasizing the manner in which relationship cognitions guide prosocial activity (see chaps. 1, 10, and 18, this volume). In this chapter, we advance a different approach. We review findings from a long-standing program of research on prosocial behavior in close relationships from an interdependence perspective. We make three main points. First, we suggest that the structure of interdependence between persons should be an important concern for social and behavioral scientists interested in understanding prosocial motivation and behavior. Second, we suggest that behaving to the benefit of one's partner in such situations rests on key structural features of relationships. Third, we propose that in interdependent relationships, each person's actions have implications for the partner. In short, we are going to suggest that psychology, particularly social psychology, should be more truly social in character when attempting to understand prosocial motives and behavior in interpersonal contexts.

Partners rely on one another to accomplish various life tasks, express their personalities (e.g. extraversion vs. introversion), and pursue shared goals (e.g. maintaining good in-law relations)

Imagine Aaron wants Arya's attention the weekend she wants to spend prepar- ing for her bar exam. In such a high-risk situation, Arya's temptation to attend to her own desire to study tempts Aaron to protect against being hurt by keeping his needs to himself. If either succumbs to temptation, Aaron's desire to spend greater time with Arya will go unmet [5,6]. For such a situation to elicit responsive behavior, Aaron needs to trust enough in Arya's commitment to risk expressing his needs In turn, Arya needs to be committed enough to Aaron to set aside her own plan to study all weekend and make meeting his needs a priority

The motivation-management model of interdependence elucidates the psychological mechanisms that coordinate partner commitment and motivate mutually responsive behavior

Risky situations —that is, situations where partners have incompatible interests—routinely test partner commitment. For partners to behave responsively, they must develop an expedient means to sustain commitment when it is tested. Indeed, people who have a strong behavioral inclination or mindset to maintain com- mitment early on in marriage are less likely to divorce after a decade of marriage

abstract = {The concept of similarity occupies an important place in several theories of social relations. An experiment was designed to examine the effects of both status and attitudinal similarity under intergroup competition or cooperation. Previous research had indicated that the usual attractive effects of similarity would be most evident in cooperative contexts, while similarity might lead to divergence under competition due to threats to group identity. Two hundred eight school children participated in a 2 × 3 × 2 factorial experiment (nature of Task × outgroup Status × outgroup Attitudes). Results indicated that, contrary to hypothesis, simple attitude similarity led to a general increase in liking for and cooperativeness toward the outgroup, unaffected by goal relations. However, on ratings of group performance, status and attitudinal similarity combined did lead to increased intergroup differentiation, again unaffected by goal relations. Finally, subjects' performances on the experimental task (a verbal and arithmetical reasoning test) were reliably affected by goal relations: highest performance being observed under intergroup cooperation, particularly with same or lower status outgroups, or with outgroups which had different attitudes. It is concluded that the need for positive distinctiveness in intergroup relations may compromise or even reverse the usual relationship between similarity and attraction.},

abstract = {Executive functions might be important for successful performance in sports, particularly in team sports requiring quick anticipation and adaptation to continuously changing situations in the field. The executive functions motor inhibition, attention and visuospatial working memory were examined in highly talented soccer players. Eighty-four highly talented youth soccer players (mean age 11.9), and forty-two age-matched amateur soccer players (mean age 11.8) in the age range 8 to 16 years performed a Stop Signal task (motor inhibition), the Attention Network Test (alerting, orienting, and executive attention) and a visuospatial working memory task. The highly talented soccer players followed the talent development program of the youth academy of a professional soccer club and played at the highest national soccer competition for their age. The amateur soccer players played at a regular soccer club in the same geographical region as the highly talented soccer players and play in a regular regional soccer competition. Group differences were tested using analyses of variance. The highly talented group showed superior motor inhibition as measured by stop signal reaction time (SSRT) on the Stop Signal task and a larger alerting effect on the Attention Network Test, indicating an enhanced ability to attain and maintain an alert state. No group differences were found for orienting and executive attention and visuospatial working memory. A logistic regression model with group (highly talented or amateur) as dependent variable and executive function measures that significantly distinguished between groups as predictors showed that these measures differentiated highly talented soccer players from amateur soccer players with 89{\%} accuracy. Highly talented youth soccer players outperform youth amateur players on suppressing ongoing motor responses and on the ability to attain and maintain an alert state; both may be essential for success in soccer.},

abstract = {This Perspective reviews recent findings in placebo hypoalgesia and provides a conceptual account of how expectations and experience can lead to placebo hypoalgesia. In particular, we put forward the idea that the ascending and the descending pain system resembles a recurrent system that allows for the implementation of predictive coding-meaning that the brain is not passively waiting for nociceptive stimuli to impinge on it but is actively making inferences based on prior experience and expectations. The Bayesian formulation within the predictive coding framework can directly account for differences in the magnitude but also the precision of expectations that are known to influence the strength of placebo hypoalgesia. We discuss how modulatory neurotransmitters such as opioids might be related to the characterization of expectations with an emphasis on the precision of these expectations. Finally, we develop experimental strategies that are suited to test this framework at the behavioral and neuronal level. In this Perspective, B{\"{u}}chel etal. develop the idea that placebo hypoalgesia is based on a predictive coding scheme implemented through a recurrent "top-down" and "bottom-up" pain system, suggesting that placebo effects emerge through active inference in this system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We examined the extent to which team composition affected team process (i.e., reflexivity) and in turn team outcomes (i.e., satisfaction, commitment, and performance). The results of diversity research thus far have been inconclusive in terms of positive or negative effects of team composition on team process and outcomes. In the current research, group longevity and outcome interdependence were expected to moderate the relationship between diversity on the one hand and reflexivity and team outcomes on the other hand. Reflexivity was expected to mediate these interaction effects. The current field study was conducted among 54 work teams from 13 different organizations. As predicted, few main effects were found. Instead, analyses showed interaction effects of diversity and outcome interdependence on the measures of reflexivity, satisfaction, and performance. As predicted, interaction effects were also found for diversity and group longevity on the measures of reflexivity, satisfaction, and performance. Three-way interactions were found for satisfaction and commitment. Also, reflexivity was shown to mediate these relationships, indicating that the moderating effects of outcome interdependence and group longevity on the relation between diversity and team outcomes are due to the effects on process.},

This study provides the first experimental demonstration that tears are a visual signal of sadness by contrasting the perceived sadness of human facial images with tears against copies of those images that had the tears digitally removed. Tear removal produced faces rated as less sad. Anecdotal findings suggest further that tear- removal often produced faces of uncertain emotional valence, perhaps awe, concern, or puzzlement, not just less sad.

abstract = {We sought to identify the mechanisms that cause strongly fused individuals (those who have a powerful, visceral feeling of oneness with the group) to make extreme sacrifices for their group. A large multinational study revealed a widespread tendency for fused individuals to endorse making extreme sacrifices for their country. Nevertheless, when asked which of several groups they were most inclined to die for, most participants favored relatively small groups, such as family, over a large and extended group, such as country (Study 1). To integrate these findings, we proposed that a common mechanism accounts for the willingness of fused people to die for smaller and larger groups. Specifically, when fused people perceive that group members share core characteristics, they are more likely to project familial ties common in smaller groups onto the extended group, and this enhances willingness to fight and die for the larger group. Consistent with this, encouraging fused persons to focus on shared core characteristics of members of their country increased their endorsement of making extreme sacrifices for their country. This pattern emerged whether the core characteristics were biological (Studies 2 and 3) or psychological (Studies 4-6) and whether participants were from China, India, the United States, or Spain. Further, priming shared core values increased the perception of familial ties among fused group members, which, in turn, mediated the influence of fusion on endorsement of extreme sacrifices for the country (Study 5). Study 6 replicated this moderated mediation effect whether the core characteristics were positive or negative. Apparently, for strongly fused persons, recognizing that other group members share core characteristics makes extended groups seem "family like" and worth dying for.},
annote = {After Atran (2010),we suggest that these forces consist of the perception of familial ties to other members of the group.

In general, we assumed that people would sacrifice themselves for large groups insofar as they are able to project familial ties onto such groups


This sense of oneness involves the union of personal identity (referring to idiosyn- cratic features of the individual) and social identity (referring to the alignment the individual has with a group). The union of the personal and social identities does not diminish the importance or impact of either one; instead, both sets of identities remain salient and agentic among fused persons

Moreover, the relational ties that fused persons form with other group members fuel their fusion with the group

Together, the agentic personal and social identities as well as relational ties fused persons have toward other group members predispose them to enact extreme sacrifices for the group

fusion theory holds that even when the group is salient, its members recognize and appre- ciate the unique relationships they form with fellow group members, much as family members do.

strong familial or relational ties to other group members as well as collective ties to the group category (Brewer {\&} Gardner, 1996; Caporael, 2001; for a discussion, see Swann et al., 2012)


Natural kinds:
Within a shared essence framework, “ingroups” and “outgroups” are presumed to resemble natural kinds (Rothbart{\&}Taylor, 1992), especially when these natural kinds are sharply defined (McGarty, Haslam, Hutchinson, {\&} Grace, 1995; Yzerbyt, Rocher, {\&} Schadron, 1997) or organized around endogamy and descent (Gil-White, 2001).

Strongly fused persons perceive other group members not just in terms of their shared group membership, but also in relational terms

moderated mediation hypothesis wherein perceptions of familial ties mediate the interactive impact of fusion and shared core characteristics on endorsement of self-sacrifice for the group.

Five experiments then examined the causal role of perceptions of shared characteristics on endorsement of extreme behavior for the group

We also tested the notion that perception of familial ties to the group would mediate the impact of priming shared core values on the tendency for fused persons to endorse self-sacrifice (Study 5), even when the shared core values were negative (Study 6).


Study 1:
designed to replicate, in an international sample,
earlier evidence of a tendency for fused persons to endorse sacri- ficing their lives for their country.
In addition, we tested the notion that, when given a choice, people are more likely to endorse dying for groups involving local rather than extended fusion.

Method
11 countries across six different continents (N ? 2,438 in total)
Fusion with country; Endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors; Preferred group to die for.

Results:
in every country included in our study, partici- pants displayed a reliable relationship between identity fusion with country and endorsement of extreme behavior for the country. The correlation between fusion with country and endorsement of ex- treme behavior for the country ranged from r(237) ? .32 (China) to r(145) ? .61 (Poland and Spain), all ps ? .001

when we added gender to this same HLM model, we discovered that males endorsed extreme sacrifice for their country more than females, Z?3.52, B?0.07, SE?0.02, p?.001 (95{\%} CI [.03, .11]), but gender did not interact with fusion in predicting endorsement of extreme behavior, Z?0.23, B?0.00, SE?0.02, p ? .815 (95{\%} CI [–.29, .04])

The majority of participants (86.1{\%}) nominated “family” as the group they were most willing to die for.

Although the percentages displayed in Table 1 reveal considerable uniformity in this effect, a chi-square test (country X choice of local vs. extended fusion group) was significant, X2 (8)?60.6, p {\textless} .001.

This finding suggests some cultural variation in choices (i.e., participants in countries like China nominated ex- tended groups more than did participants in other countries)

The important theoretical message here, however, is the overwhelming tendency for participants to endorse dying for a local rather than extended group. Indeed, when we computed the number of partic- ipants who chose to die for a local rather than extended group more than 50{\%} of the time, all ?2
s(df ? 1) exceeded 75, all ps ? .001

The results also revealed that groups associated with extended
fusion were nominated far less often than groups associated with local fusion. For example, country was the preferred group to die for 0{\%} of times in some countries (Germany, Poland, and Austra- lia), and the highest percentage was 12.6{\%} (China)

Conclusions:
1. The positive associations between identity fusion with country and endorsement of extreme behavior for one's country were replicated in samples from six continents and 11 countries.

2. When given a chance to endorse dying for several different groups, participants in all of the countries we sampled were especially inclined to die for small groups in general and family in particular, testifying to the psychological allure of the familial ties present in small groups. 

3. There was considerable variability in the strength of the relationship between fusion with country and endorsement of extreme behavior for country. Apparently, fusion does not automatically trigger endorsement of extreme behavior for large groups. Instead, moderator and mediator variables may influence the strength of the relationship between fusion with country and endorsement of extreme sacrifice for country


Study 2:
We predict that among fused persons, the perception of shared core values should enhance perception of familial ties and perception of familial ties should predict increased willingness to fight and die for the group. We explore the moderation hypotheses in Studies 2–6 and add the mediating role of perception of familial ties in Studies 5 and 6. In Studies 2 and 3, we began by priming participants' perceptions that members of their country share common genes.},

abstract = {We review empirical data from both ethology and psychology about generalization, that is how animals respond to sets of stimuli including familiar as well as novel stimuli. Our main conclusion is that many characteristics of generalization are universal behavioural phenomena, suggesting that they originate from general properties of nervous mechanisms and/or that evolutionary strategies to cope with novelty and variability in stimulation are limited. We also reach the following conclusions. First, patterns of generalization are largely independent of systematic group (evidence is available for insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans), behavioural context (feeding, drinking, orientation, etc.), modality (light, sound, etc.) and of whether reaction to stimuli is learned or genetically inherited. Second, two major shapes of the generalization gradient can be identified, corresponding to two types of stimulus dimensions. When changes in stimulation involve a rearrangement of a constant amount of stimulation on the sense organs, the generalization gradient peaks close to familiar stimuli, and peak responding is not much higher than responding to familiar stimuli. When the dimension involves increase or decrease of the intensity of stimulation, the gradient is often monotonic, and responding to some novel stimuli is considerably stronger than responding to familiar stimuli, compared to non-intensity dimensions. Third, rearrangement gradients are better described by Gaussian curves, rather than exponentials as often suggested. Fourth, when several or many familiar stimuli are close to each other interferences occur, giving rise to predictable response biases such as peak shift or supernormality (interference between positive and negative stimuli), and stretched bell shaped curves (several positive stimuli). Lastly, no principle differences between biases referred to as peak shift and biases referred to as supernormal stimulation are found. The paper ends with a discussion of theoretical issues.},

abstract = {In this paper I explore the psychology of ritual performance and present a simple graphical model that clarifies several issues in William Irons's theory of religion as a "hard-to-fake" sign of commitment. Irons posits that religious behaviors or rituals serve as costly signals of an individual's commitment to a religious group. Increased commitment among members of a religious group may facilitate intra-group cooperation, which is argued to be the primary adaptive benefit of religion. Here I propose a proximate explanation for how individuals are able to pay the short-term costs of ritual performance to achieve the long-term fitness benefits offered by religious groups. The model addresses three significant problems raised by Irons's theory. First, the model explains why potential free-riders do not join religious groups even when there are significant net benefits that members of religious groups can achieve. Second, the model clarifies how costly a ritual must be to achieve stability and prevent potential free-riders from joining the religious group. Third, the model suggests why religious groups may require adherents to perform private rituals that are not observed by others. Several hypotheses generated from the model are also discussed.},
annote = {Considering the phenomenal reproductive rates of Hutterites, the real mys- tery for evolutionary biology is why the rest of us are not trying to join their colonies (Cronk 1994b:615)

The challenge lies in determining why humans per- form behaviors that often entail significant proximate costs, such as time, energetic, and material costs, as well as physical and psychological pain.

William Irons (1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 2001) has argued that these character- istics, which make religious behaviors puzzling from an egoistic perspec- tive, are actually the key to understanding their universality.

costliness of religious behaviors enables them to serve as hard-to- fake signs of commitment to a group. Empirical tests have supported Irons's verbal arguments (Sosis 2000; Sosis and Bressler 2003; Sosis and Ruffle 2003)

the primary question concerns why humans in- ternalize religious beliefs that demand ritual practice

COSTLY SIGNALING THEORY AND RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR
These benefits in- clude improved health, survivorship, economic opportunities, sense of community, psychological well-being, assistance during crises, mating op- portunities, and fertility (see Reynolds and Tanner 1995 for a review).

Reli- gion's ability to promote group solidarity and cooperation underlies its capacity to offer many of these benefits.

Irons (2001; also see Cronk 1994a; Sosis 2000) suggests that religion can promote intra-group cooperation by increasing trust among adherents.

Various authors have argued that reli- gion facilitates intra-group cooperation, most notably Durkheim (1995 [1912]); however, Irons's work posits a plausible adaptive explanation for why it occurs.

He argues that in human history the adaptive advantage of group living was the benefits that individuals attained through intra-group cooperation such as cooperative hunting, food sharing, defense, and warfare

However, despite the potential for individual gains through coopera- tion, these collective pursuits are often difficult to achieve. Intra-group cooperation is typically characterized by conditions in which individuals can maximize their gains by refraining from cooperation when others invest in the cooperative activity

Thus, although everyone may gain if all group members invest in the cooperative goal, attaining such large-scale cooperation is often difficult to achieve without social mechanisms limit- ing the potential to free-fide on the efforts of others (Dawes 1980; Olson 1965).

The potential for collective action is confronted with problems of trust
and commitment (Frank 1988; Schelling 1960)

Those who in- teract can advertise a willingness to cooperate, although this strategy is not stable.

Therefore, whenever an individual can achieve net benefits from defection, the only credible signals of cooperative intentions are those that are "costly-to-fake." If commitment signals are not costly-to- fake, they can easily be imitated by free-riders who do not intend to invest in the cooperative pursuit. Several researchers (Berman 2000; Cronk 1994a; Irons 1996a, 1996b, 1996(:, 2001; Iannaccone 1992, 1994) have suggested that religious behaviors are cosily-to-fake signals of commitment.

For example, many populations require males and females to undergo initiation rites that include beatings, genital mutilations, exposure to extreme temperatures, tattooing, isola- tion, food and water deprivation, consumption of toxic substances, and death threats (e.g., Tuzin 1982; Whiting et al. 1958; Young 1965)

maintain intra-group solidarity by requiring costly behavioral patterns of group members. Religious beliefs appear to be well suited to solve collec- tive action problems by increasing commitment and loyalty to others who share these beliefs. By increasing trust among group members, religious groups avoid or minimize costly monitoring mechanisms that are other- wise necessary to overcome free-rider problems that typically plague communal pursuits.

Islam {\&} Long-distance Commerce/Trade:
Thus, Islam provided a mechanism to overcome the collective action prob- lems of long-distance commerce. Conversion to Islam increased trust among traders, which reduced transaction costs, making trade more prof- itable. In addition, high levels of trust among Muslim coreligionists al- lowed for greater credit to be extended, facilitating further trade expansion.

Ensminger contends that the steep initiation costs of entry into Islam, such as daily prayer, abstaining from alcohol, fasting during Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca, served as the means for establishing a reputation among traders for trustworthiness. In other words, these rituals and taboos are costly signals of commitment that served to prevent free-riders from achieving the benefits of more efficient trade

Irons's theory may provide insights into the adaptive functions of a
wide range of religious rituals, including subincision rites, mourning prac- tices, and even prayer. It may also explain a variety of secular rituals (cf. Sosis and Bressler 2003). For example, army boot camp and fraternity hell week can both be interpreted as necessary rites that signal commitment to other group members. Nevertheless, there are several issues in the argu- ment that need clarification.

but presumably these costs have little (negative) impact on their fertility. If membership in a group that re- quires ritual practices genuinely results in net fitness gains, why do others not simply perform the rituals required for membership, even if they do not believe the doctrine that gives meaning to the rituals?


All ethnographers who are immersed for an extended time in a community very different from that of their origin eventually ask themselves, What if I were to spend the rest of my life here? When these thoughts occurred to me, it always seemed obvious that were I to stay, conversion to and conspicuous practice of Islam would be the best route to acceptance by the local commu- nity (Irons 2001:301).

the size of the costs that are necessary to prevent free-riders from entering a population.

Costly signaling theory informs us that the costs of a signal are always conditional; they are dependent on the quality of the signaler (Johnstone 1997). Thus, there is no absolute level of costliness that will ensure that a ritual will stabilize in a population.

Stability will be de- termined by the relative costs of ritual performance to signalers of varying quality, although it is not clear how great the relative costs must be to achieve a state of equilibrium.

Irons (2001) on Utilia Honduras:
Men claim that they prefer to marry women who regularly attend church be- cause they are more likely to be faithful wives. In the language of costly signaling theory, variance in church attendance is used as a signal to assess variance in fidelity; faithful women are of higher "quality" than promis- cuous women. However, what is preventing women from attending church and pursuing discreet free sexual choice?

Most anthropological approaches to the function of religion, including
Irons's, have focused on the group-level phenomenon of ritual performance and its unifying effect among participants (e.g., Durkheim 1995 [1912]; Hayden 1987; Radcliffe-Brown 1952; Rappaport 1979; Turner 1969), whereas the function of private ritual performance has received much less attention (but see Rappaport 1999)

If the function of ritual is to promote group solidarity, why do religious groups often require the performance of rituals that are not publicly observed? How can the performance of pri- vate rituals serve as a signal of commitment to group members?

Some private rituals, such as textual study, have consequences that can be eval- uated in the public arena and hence are difficult to fake. However, many religiously prescribed private rituals can seemingly be ignored without possibility of detection.

There is a "Psychology of Ritual Performance": BELIEF
"We do not have faith because of deeds; we may attain faith through sacred deeds .... Through the ecstasy of deeds he learns to be certain of the here- hess of God. Right living is a way to right thinking" (Heschel 1955:282-283)

Although it is commonly held that behavior patterns are proximally motivated by attitudes developed from past experience (e.g., Ajzen 1988; Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) and current environmental stimuli,

social psychologists have also shown that behavior can impact attitudes, opinions, and beliefs (Bern 1965, 1966; Fazio 1987; Janis and King 1954; Vallacher and Wegner 1985; Zimbardo et al. 1969)

For example, studies have shown that performing an action as seemingly innocuous as signing a petition (Freedman and Fraser 1966) or filling out a form (Cioffi and Garner 1966) can result in significant attitude change.

Two main theories have been developed to explain these observations: 1.self-perception theory and 
2. cognitive dissonance theory.

Self-perception theory (Bern 1965, 1972) claims that one way that people acquire their attitudes and beliefs is by observing themselves.

Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger 1957, 1964; also see Aronson 1997) claims that psychological discomfort that arises from possessing attitudes inconsistent with behavior can produce changes in those attitudes. 

A person's belief prior to the rele- vant action is the critical determinant of which process will occur. When individuals perform actions that are not in discord with their initial atti- tudes, social perception processes occur; when actions are divergent from initial attitudes, emotional discordance is experienced and cognitive dis- sonance occurs (Fazio et al. 1977)

Both theories predict, however, that when the values associated with a behavior are highly contrary to initial beliefs, behaviors are likely to be altered rather than belief, unless addi- tional pressures (e.g., social or authority pressures) are influencing the continuation of the behavior.

When overt actions imply a set of values, such as the cause of a petition, the values can become internalized into private conviction.

Although external forces such as punishment threats or social control can alter behavior, studies have shown that once these pressures are removed, individuals often return to their prior behavioral patterns (e.g., Freedman 1965). Internalization is the critical determinant of successful long-term attitudinal change, and consequently behavioral change (Deci and Ryan 1985; Freed- man 1965; Kelman 1958; Tyler and Blader 2000)

Those who believe that an action is correct or appropriate will continue to perform it even after punishment threats for noncompliance are removed.

Interestingly, performance of the action itself may lead to changes in attitude about the behavior, consequently reinforcing the behavioral pattern (e.g., Chandler and Connell 1987)

little effort has been invested in explaining how religious beliefs become internalized. 

It is argued here that ritual, by employing the same psychological processes that translate value-laden actions into attitudinal changes, is the mechanism through which religions maintain belief among adherents.

Rituals are not empty performances; they are embedded with meaning, symbolism, and moral consequences (Geertz 1973; Leach 1976; Turner 1967)

Rituals are always buoyed by cos- mological explanations that provide significance, insight, and apprecia- tion for the performers. Cosmology and theology also serve to inextricably bind ritual's performers to the moral code of the community (Rappaport 1999). Since ritual performance is unambiguously associated with overt group values, self-perception or cognitive dissonance processes will cause nonbelievers to either modify their belief or discontinue the ritual actions.

consider the reactions of religious sect members to failed prophecy:
studies have shown that commitrnent to the group actually increases after some anticipated event fails to transpire (Festinger et al. 1956; Gager 1975; Wilson 1987; cf. Balch et al. 1983, 1997). To reconcile the contradiction of their behavior (i.e., investing and participating in group activities) and the new information suggesting that their leader is a fraud, or at least not prophetic, adherents claim greater belief in the teachings of the leader and pursue group rituals and activities with renewed passion.

Rituals possess four characteristics:
(1) physical actions, 
(2) generally social and publicly performed,
(3) formal, and 
(4) often repetitive and cyclical. 

By providing concrete evidence of their participation, each of these features potentially contributes to cognitive dissonance or self-perception processes if the performer does not share the values encoded in the ritual.

Since ritual performance is widely observed there are additional social pressures to reconcile any contradictions be- tween belief and behavior, pressures that would be absent if ritual were only privately performed. In addition, the formality of ritual makes it an effective mode of communication

As Rappaport (1979, 1999) has pointed out, although ritual behaviors appear to be shrouded in mystery, they are deliberate and their message to other adherents is clear: participation in a ritual performance signals acceptance of the moral values encoded in the ritual.

teachings which several months before would have found unreceptive ears are now willingly accepted. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that ritual is most effective at transforming beliefs when initial views and attitudes are either ambiguous or not too divergent from those implied in the ritual performance.

Religious training for children is a process similar to that employed
by proselytizing cults and religions. Galanter (1999) suggests that self- perception plays a role in the development of religious identity:

"People may, for example, attribute meaning to important experiences in life by recourse to their family's religious background, but usually they had adopted these attitudes without formal intention, in part because they ob- served themselves engaged in that faith as they grew up. One does not nec- essarily arrive at a conscious decision about one's religious orientation, but rather acknowledges "I am a Catholic" or "I am a Jew" because one has re- peatedly carried out practices associated with that faith" (Galanter 1999:56).

Indeed, theology is not taught to a five-year-old child, but five-year-old children raised in a religious environment engage in a wide array of ritual behaviors. Later in life, theology will provide the meanings and rationali- zations for the rituals that the individual has performed for years

Just like RUGBY!

"persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain some- thing tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort" (1959:177). Several researchers (Aronson and Mills 1959; Gerard and Mathewson 1966) have shown that individuals who pay higher initiation costs to enter a group are more satisfied with group membership than those who had little or no initiation costs for entry. 

Second, since Festinger's ground-breaking Theory of Social Com- parison Processes (Festinger 1954), social psychologists have demon- strated that human opinions are significantly influenced by others, even when all other evidence contradicts these opinions (e.g., Asch 1951; Sherif 1958)

Thus, it is likely that the social and public nature of ritual activity puts added pressure on performers to accept the values communicated by the performance (Rappaport 1999).

Costly Signaling Model of Ritual

First, if variation in the signal is directly linked to variation in the phenotypic quality being advertised, there is no possibility of deceit (Johnstone 1997, 1998). 

For example, in most species the frequency of vocal signals reliably reveals the size of the caller because physical size is directly linked to the organism's ability to produce calls of specific frequency

Second, even if the signal is not directly linked to phenotypic quality, signals expressing phenotypic condition can be honest if the costs to lower-quality organisms of imitating the signals of higher-quality organisms outweigh the benefits that can be achieved (Grafen 1990; Zahavi 1975, 1977). This may result from differential costs or benefits faced by high- and low-quality signalers

The costly signaling theory of ritual posits that ritual performance is a signal that advertises an individual's level of commitment to the group

Preferred signalers are those who are highly committed to the group and are thus likely to be cooperators

The critical underlying condition of in- terest to the receiver is the depth of belief in the teachings and values of the group; devout believers are those who are most dedicated to the ideals, values, and goals of the group

If ritual actions influence belief, as was argued above, then there is a direct link between the signal (ritual perfor- mance) and phenotypic quality (piety)

However, regardless of how powerful and efficient these psychological processes may be, they assume some initial ambiguity in belief. Thus, although there is a partial link between the signal and adver- tised phenotype, the link is not absolute

Therefore, rituals must also be costly to maintain their signaling reliability. Ritual performers, whether they are free-riders or committed members, are not likely to face differential benefits; ceteris paribus any individual performing the ritual requirements of a religious group is likely to gain the benefits of group membership.

Individuals also face similar costs when performing rituals; however, here I will argue that they perceive these costs differently

(1) Why are most of us unwilling to join reproductively successful religious groups? 
(2) How costly must a ritual be for it to be an effective deterrent of free-riders? 
(3) Why do religious groups mandate that their members engage in pri- vate rituals that can easily be ignored? 

If the economic survival of each group is dependent upon their ability to cooperate with others in their group, believers will always achieve higher net gains than skeptics.

Of course, unconditional trust is not a stable strategy. Cheaters who pro-
fess belief but defect can easily invade a group of trusting believers, and a mistrustful strategy will quickly dominate the population.

However, consider what happens if one must perform a costly act, such as a ritual, to be- come a member of the believer group. Initially, let us assume that to enter the group everyone must perform the ritual, and this performance results in the same costs for everyone

At equilibrium, joining either the group of be- lievers or skeptics will result in equivalent payoffs. Thus there will be no incentives to perform costly rituals, and they are not expected to emerge.

If group members are re- quired to pray five times per day, regardless of whether or not individuals believe the words they are reciting, they pay the same time and energy costs while engaging in prayer.

However, believers and skeptics are not likely to evaluate their net costs similarly. When performing ritual actions prescribed by the doctrine of the believers, the internal evaluation of opportunity costs will be higher for skeptics than for believers. 

The difference in perceived costs of performing rituals for believers and skeptics is caused by the influence that ritual performance has on belief patterns.

As was argued above, the physical, formal, public, and repetitive nature of ritual performance stimulates cognitive processes for the nonbeliever that will result in either a change in belief or a discontinuation of the ritual actions. (BUY IN OR FUCK OFF)

The perceived opportunity costs of believers are relatively flat because the utility of activities forgone is low for true believers. 

An individual who genuinely believes that eating during a religiously pre- scribed fast results in eternal damnation will eagerly participate in the fast.

Figure 3 suggests that the intensity of religious belief is negatively cor-
related with the perceived cost of ritual actions prescribed by the religion; as one becomes more committed to the dogma of the religion, the benefits that one can achieve from alternative activities will decline.

As believers achieve an "ultimate state" (e.g., Nirvana, Brahma, Bit- tul), their perceived costs of ritual performance decline. Fundamentalism is characterized by increasing Rmin.

The minimum ritual requirements of a group will actually be deter-
mined by the alternative opportunities available to potential free-riders.

The intensity of the requirements is determined by the costs to potential free-riders.

abstract = {Hunting, particularly when it involves large game that is extensively shared, has been suggested to serve as a form of costly signaling by hunters, serving to attract mates and allies or to deter competitors. Empirical evidence presented elsewhere on turtle hunting practiced by Meriam people of Torres Strait, Australia, supports several key predictions of the costly signaling account. Here we present evidence from the same study bearing on another key prediction, that signalers (hunters) gain social and reproductive benefits. Specifically, we find that successful hunters gain social recognition, have an earlier onset of reproduction, achieve higher age-specific reproductive success, and gain higher quality mates, who also achieve above-average reproductive success. Meriam hunters also average more mates (women who bear their offspring) and more co-resident sexual partners than other men, and these partners (but not mates) are significantly younger. Several lines of evidence thus support the idea that hunting is a form of costly signaling in this population. Alternative hypotheses involving reciprocity (from grateful recipients of meat) and direct offspring provisioning by hunters are not consistent with available evidence, but in the absence of experimental manipulation we cannot rule out a role for phenotypic correlation.},

@article{Soler2014,
abstract = {Although the study of signals has been part of human behavioral ecology since the field's inception,(1) only recently has signaling theory become important to the evolutionary study of human behavior and culture.(2) Signaling theory's rise to prominence has been propelled mainly by applications of costly signaling theory,(3) which has shed light on a wide variety of human behaviors ranging from hunting(4) to religion.(5,6) Costly signaling rests on the idea that wasteful but highly visible traits and behaviors can be explained as honest indicators of underlying qualities that are otherwise difficult to detect. For example, a laborious hunting technique may serve as a display of skill on the part of the hunter, who may then be favorably perceived by potential mates and allies.(4) The costs of the activity ensure that the signal is honest, since unskilled hunters will not be able to perform as well. Despite the usefulness of this perspective, many such studies begin by documenting a costly behavior that is then explained with reference to costly signaling theory. Because such behaviors are easy to detect, they may be overemphasized in the literature.(7) Moreover, costly signaling theory by itself can explain neither all signals nor all aspects of signal design. In this review, we argue that a focus on the role that the psychology of the intended receiver plays in signal design can expand the scope of signaling theory as a promising avenue to explain human behavior.},

How signal design is constrained by the perceptual and cognitive systems of the receiverhow features of receivers' psychology can be exploited by signalers

costly signaling can be understood as an approach to signaling that focuses on a single subset of receiver psychology: the receiver's skepticism regarding the signaler's honesty

Costly signaling rests on the idea that wasteful but highly visible traits and behaviors can be explained as honest indicators of underlying qualities that are otherwise difficult to detect

The costs of the activity ensure that the signal is honest, since unskilled hunters will not be able to perform as well

If a signal is costly, only individuals in good condition or those who are in greater need of receiving the benefits of the display will find it beneficial to produce it.

What is signaling? 
Most recently, considerable debate has hinged on whether ani- mal signaling is best understood as information transfer or influence.

“Informational” or “adaptationist” definitions rest on the assumption that true signaling or communica- tion occurs when there is a trans- fer of information between senders and receivers that, on average, ben- efits both parties

these definitions cannot accommodate instances in which one party deceives or exploits the other:

For example, a widely used three-part definition is that a signal is 
“i.) any act or structure which alters the behaviour of other organisms, 
ii.) which evolved because of that effect 
iii.) and which is effective because the receiver's response has also evolved.”

Instead, Owren, Rendall, and Ryan propose to define signaling as the use of “specialized, species-typical morphology or behavior to influence the current or future behavior of abnother individual"

In this view, only the signaler's traits and actions are necessarily the product of biological evolution, while the receiver's response may be due to other factors, such as inherent “sensibility” in its perceptual or sensory systems

Our definition of signaling for humans...Influence and not information-based signlaling 

Our only caveat is that we need to relax the stipulation that a signal must be the product of biological evolution

Given the wide range of novel and constantly changing signals made possible by language, this is particularly important for the study of human signals. Thus, for our purposes, a signal is any act or structure that is designed to alter the behavior of other organisms, regardless of whether it is a product of natural or cultural selection

While receivers are expected to evolve resistance to strongly exploitative signals, these may persist if they are sufficiently rare

Moreover, this definition allows us to recognize signals even in situations of disequilibrium: (i.e. in the case of humans or dolphins) in which social learning can lead receivers to respond to novel signals in maladaptive ways

Arguments that defend the adaptationist view deal with the problem of deceptive or exploitative signals by qualifying definitions with adjec- tives, such as “communication” versus “deceptive communication”84 or by considering such cases as something altogether different from signaling, such as “coercion.”

We find the addition of more terms to be confusing rather than illuminating, especially since there is no agreed-upon tax- onomy of related terminology. Although it is correct that receivers are not always “prisoners” of their sensory systems,86 it is also quite true that such systems will shape the range of signals that can be attended to

As humans, we are also, at least to some degree, prisoners of cultural systems that constrain the kinds of stimuli we are likely to respond to. Thus, we favor an influence-based definition of signaling that does not assume symmetrical benefits for senders and receivers and that can accommodate both cooperative and competitive interactions

all signals can be seen as manipulative in the sense that they are designed and sent in order to change the behavior or another organism

Although selection should favor the evolution of skeptical receivers who ignore exploitative signals and signal- ers who then economize by not sending such signals at all, it is not always safe to assume that such an equilibrium has been reached

More- over, because of the speed with which cultural change can occur among humans, situations of evolutionary disequilibrium may be particularly common in our own species

Learned signals will be perceived and attended to only in asmuch as they engage aspects of receiver psychology. In turn, receiver psychology itself may be shaped by both intrinsic and learned biases

Sensory Traps and Hidden Preferences
These are sensory traps. Second, hid- den preferences are by-products of other cognitive capacities or neural structures, “side-effects or contingencies of how the sensory system, defined in its widest sense, of the receiver is constructed

A preference for symmetrical mates may have evolved as a response to cues of developmental stability and genetic quality,31 but such bias may help explain the wide- spread occurrence of symmetry in pottery, lithics, and other manufactured objects

Symmetry may be a hard-to-fake signal of the maker's skill rather than the result of a hidden preference

Sound
Blumstein and colleagues46 have found that nonlinear sound ele- ments, such as unpredictable changes in frequency, distorting noise, and harsh sounds, do indeed provoke arousal and negative valence in human subjects, which suggests an association with threatening situa- tions in ancestral environments:

These responses may be exploited in a variety of contexts. For example, an evaluation of the presence or absence of nonlinear analogues in film sound- tracks revealed that horror films employ more noise than expected, evoking fearful responses, while dramatic films use more sudden changes in frequency to induce emo- tional reactions from audience members

Sounds and shapes
Their results indicate that subjects preferentially used stri- dent consonants to name jagged objects and sonorous ones to name rounded ones when nonsense words were presented in both written or auditory formats.48 In addition, sub- jects had more difficulty learning associations between words and shapes when these were incongruent with the strident-jagged or sonorant-curved rule,49 and were more likely than chance to build nonsense words consisting of plo- sive, strident consonants to desig- nate jagged shapes and rounded vowels to designate curved ones.

the presence of innate biases plays a role in shaping the most important form of human communication. Further research in this area would benefit from stand- ardized experiments across linguis- tic and cultural groups

Peak shift
Peak shift refers to the way that an organism that has been trained to discriminate between rewarded and unrewarded stimuli that vary within the same dimension (such as wavelength, tone frequency, or space) will show the strongest reaction to a novel stimulus that is more extreme – that is, farther away from conditioned stimuli

Thus, while a preference for exaggerated traits may be evolved, the con- text in which it is expressed can consist of learned associations

In humans, Spetch, Cheng, and Clifford54 have shown that peak shift has an impact on facial recognition. Such a bias may explain how distinctive features of faces are mentally represented and remembered.

COGNITIVE BIASES, LEARNING, AND CULTURE
Because these processes depend on rapid and automatic cognition rather than a cautious evalua- tion of the domains that activate them, they may be particularly prone to exploitation by others

One example is the use of kinship terminology to elicit altruistic tendencies. Recog- nizing kin members is important to determine where our cooperative efforts should lie. While there are many nonverbal ways of recognizing kin, humans have developed numer- ous terminologies that recognize such relationships but also use them in ways that do not correspond with biological ties.

The exploitation of a kinship bias is evident in various forms of religious and political rhetoric, although the use of specific terms will surely depend on the intended audience

Qirko has argued that organizations that sponsor suicide terrorism and organizations that require celibacy (such as orders of monks) routinely use the language of kinship to motivate their recruits. Similarly, Salmon assessed the persuasive power of kin terms by having her subjects read one of three different versions of a political speech. One used terms such as “brothers and sisters,” another replaced those terms with “friends,” and the third used the phrase “fellow citizens.” The first version was more persuasive than either of the other two.

Culture {\&} Social Learning 
In our view, the most useful understanding of culture is one cen- tered on its ideational rather than behavioral properties. Most concisely, culture can be viewed as “a system of socially transmitted
information.”64:140'

This definition allows us to consider innate and learned aspects of cognition inde- pendently and to examine behavior as a manifestation of either or both.

cognitive biases shape the information we supply to others and frame the behavioral expressions that result from it

In the latter case, acquiring information through learning may give rise to biases and preferences that are much more plastic in nature and that can vary across groups

culture is part of the milieu that determines the design, intensity, and use of signals


Individual Differences in Receiver Psychology

Differences in signal perception within the same species may be found, given diversity in sex, age, or other qualities.

voice perception: Low-pitched male voices are consistently rated as more attractive by women and are perceived as more dominant, while men prefer higher-pitched female voices


CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Receiver psychology also provides a link between the study of signals and the study of cultural transmission

Understanding the direction of perceptual and cognitive biases can help us interpret the spread and features of various cul- tural phenomena even when adaptive benefits are unclear

Whining by children has been shown to capture increased attention from listeners and cause physiological arousal in both parents and nonpar- ents,74

Much of what shapes receiver psy- chology is still largely unknown. For example, sensitivity to particular cues is expected to differ between the sexes and throughout the life cycle (Box 3), but other aspects of individual variation (such as attrac- tiveness, height, or status) may also shape such biases. Recent work sug- gests that subtle aspects of commu- nication, such as shared eye gaze direction or a similar posture, cue various forms of coordination

Language Style Matching (LSM) has been shown to increase cohesiveness in small groups and improve group per- formance in an experimental task

Ireland and coworkers79 have also found that LSM predicts mutual ini- tial romantic interest in people meet- ing for the first time, as well as relationship stability in couples inde- pendently of conscious measures of relationship quality

Receptivity to other tacit patterns in verbal and nonverbal communication may further explain the seemingly arbitrary preferences that underlie friendship or romantic attachment

Signaling theory provides a coherent frame- work that can incorporate input from various disciplines to shed light on the nature of such biases, the structure and design of signals, the salience of specific signal fea- tures, and the consequences of variable signal use.},

abstract = {We propose an explanation of cooperation among unrelated members of a social group in which cooperation evolves because it constitutes an honest signal of the member's quality as a mate, coalition partner or competitor, and therefore results in advantageous alliances for those signaling in this manner. Our model is framed as a multi-player public goods game that involves no repeated or assortative interactions, so that non-cooperation would be a dominant strategy if there were no signaling benefits. We show that honest signaling of underlying quality by providing a public good to group members can be evolutionarily stable, and can proliferate in a population in which it is initially rare, provided that certain plausible conditions hold, including a link between group-beneficial signaling and underlying qualities of the signaler that would be of benefit to a potential mate or alliance partner. Our model applies to a range of cooperative interactions, including unconditionally sharing individually consumable resources, participating in group raiding or defense, and punishing free-riding or other violations of social norms.},
annote = {Cooperation among unrelated individuals has generally been explained by some form of conditional reciprocity (Trivers 1971, Axelrod and Hamilton 1981) [tit for tat]

mutualism (Brown 1983, Connor 1995), 
indirect reciprocity (Alexander 1987, Nowak and Sigmund 1998,Wedekind and Milinski 2000, Leimar and Hammerstein 2001), and 
multilevel selection (Wilson 1977, Bowles 2001, Sober and Wilson 1998, Gintis 2000b)

Following arguments outlined in Smith and Bliege Bird (2000), here we present a game-theoretic model in which cooperative behavior indicates the underlying (dichotomous) quality of the signaler, eliciting a (dichotomous) response from observers that can be mutually beneficial

The model is framed as a multi-player game that involves no repeated or assortative interactions, and assumes a payoff structure that would conform to an multi-player public goods game (and hence universal defection) if there were no signaling benefits.

We show that honest signaling of underlying quality by providing a benefit to group members can be evolutionarily stable, and may proliferate when rare as long as high-quality individuals are neither too common nor too rare, and the cost of signaling is sufficiently greater for low than for high quality players.

Our signaling model is distinctive in applying to group (n signalers and n observers) rather than dyadic or many-signaler one-observer interactions. It is also novel in determining endogenously the fraction of the group that signals high quality in equilibrium. Finally, our model operates at the phenotypic level, and abstracts from the specific genetic mechanisms involved in trait-transmission. We supply novel and plausible conditions for the spread of prosocial signals

We study the case where cooperation involves providing a benefit to all members of the group unconditionally (i.e., without any necessary reciprocation in kind). Given the resulting public goods game payoff structure and the one-shot nature of the interactions, the unique equilibrium of this game under standard assumptions is universal defection, so no player supplies the group benefit

individually costly cooperation could not evolve unless one postulated the group selection of altruistic behavior. Even if interactions among group members were repeated, multi-player cooperation requires implausible forms of coordination, particularly if the group contains more than a few individuals (Boyd and Richerson 1988)

We propose that cooperating by providing a benefit to group members may be a reliable signal of signaler quality, where by “quality” we mean genetic or phenotypic attributes that are difficult for others to assess directly, yet have important effects on the payoffs from social interactions with the signaler

This information alters the behavior of other group members to act, for purely selfish motives, in ways that provide positive payoffs to signalers—for example, preferring them as allies or mates, or deferring to them in competitive situations (Smith and Bliege Bird 2000)

we develop an multi-player model showing that there exists an equilibrium in which quality is honestly signaled over a wide range of parameter values in which low quality types must pay more to signal than high quality types.},

METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

Cognitive neuroscience research suggests that successful self-regulation is dependent on top-down control from the prefrontal cortex over subcortical regions involved in reward and emotion. We highlight recent neuroimaging research on self-regulatory failure, the findings of which support a balance model of self-regulation whereby self-regulatory failure occurs whenever the balance is tipped in favor of subcortical areas, either due to particularly strong impulses or when prefrontal function itself is impaired. Such a model is consistent with recent findings in the cognitive neuroscience of addictive behavior, emotion regulation and decision-making. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: In nonhuman mammals, the neuropeptide oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to increase social approach behavior and pair bonding. In particular, central nervous oxytocin reduces behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to social stress and is suggested to mediate the rewarding aspects of attachment in highly social species. However, to date there have been no studies investigating the effects of central oxytocin mechanisms on behavior and physiology in human couple interaction. Methods: In a double-blind placebo-controlled design, 47 heterosexual couples (total n = 94) received oxytocin or placebo intranasally before a standard instructed couple conflict discussion in the laboratory. The conflict session was videotaped and coded for verbal and nonverbal interaction behavior (e.g., eye contact, nonverbal positive behavior, and self-disclosure). Salivary cortisol was repeatedly measured during the experiment. Results: Oxytocin significantly increased positive communication behavior in relation to negative behavior during the couple conflict discussion (F = 4.18, p = .047) and significantly reduced salivary cortisol levels after the conflict compared with placebo (F = 7.14, p = .011). Conclusions: These results are in line with animal studies indicating that central oxytocin facilitates approach and pair bonding behavior.

In turn, heightened moral purity leads to greater prosocial behavior. In Experiment 1, participants instructed to recall childhood memories were more likely to help the experimenter with a supplementary task than were participants in a control condition, and this effect was mediated by moral purity. In Experiment 2, the same manipulation increased the amount of money participants donated to a good cause, and both implicit and explicit measures of moral purity mediated the effect. Experiment 3 provides further support for the process linking childhood memories and prosocial behavior through moderation. In Experiment 4, we found that childhood memories led to punishment of others' ethically questionable actions.

The feeling of pain in humans produces information flow to neural regions that generate both sensations and motivations



He argued that the alleviation of pain can result via cessation of sensation (nociceptive pathways) or via fulfillment of motivation (affective pathways); that is, placebos work because they motivate successful help seeking, inde- pendent of any direct action of the helper on the cause of the pain.

Here we extend Wall's functional account of pain more broadly to the interaction of pain with stabilized altruism in human cultures


We argue that, over evolutionary time, several stimuli and situations that are painful in neither mammals generally nor in our primate relatives particularly have come to be experienced as pain in humans, accompanied by obvious distress that serves to elicit help from others

It neither supports nor contra- dicts any claim that pain and suffering are different in humans because of social learning, the ability to predict pain, or an understanding of the consequences of trauma.

Rather, we argue that the primary circuitry of pain and malaise has been changed in human evolution in cases where getting help from others would be useful, because those who did survived.


The changing neuroanatomy of pain

Many features of pain sensitivity are intrinsically ‘predictive', with some predictions laid down by evolution and some by individual experience

Craig has expanded understanding of visceroception from concen- tration on somatic pain to how multiple aspects of body state are integrated with cognition and behavior via their representation in the insular cortex

The more extensive insular representation of body state may allow a more dynamic, predictive, experience-based modulation of pain states than possible in other, smaller brains, from basic time course to social contextualization

Empathetic responses to pain must certainly employ this circuitry.

...an evolutionary reassignment of some stimuli or states as painful, coupled to response systems that elicit help

Child Birth:
No one contests the true pain of the labor leading up to birth nor considers it a cultural construct, although it is the object of much cultural attention. 

Furthermore, great dif- ficulty in parturition is not unique to humans among primates, nor mammals.

While other primates and mammals have been observed to protect a birthing mother at times, nonhuman primates do not seek or get assistance at birth; indeed, attempts by the prospective mother to isolate herself are more probable

We suggest that cervi- cal dilation has become rivetingly painful to induce help seeking and all of its subsequent cultural elaborations in our social species. The offspring of those who sought help are more likely to be (with) us.

Response to Pain:
a helper must also respond. The prototypical occasion where protection and provisioning are provided in response to distress is in mother–infant interactions, although this response is shown by males in biparental care and, more generally, in the various cases of alloparenting [13].

However, the obligatory role of females in these instances of pain sensation and response, birth and infant care, may bear some causal role in the reported lower female pain thresholds and greater response to pain in others [4]},

abstract = {Oxytocin facilitates stress regulation but little is known about individual differences in this effect. The present study investigates whether the effect of intranasal oxytocin on stress-contingent cortisol release differs between individuals with high vs. low emotional regulation abilities (ERA). In a double-blind study thirty-six healthy male students with either high or low ERA were randomly assigned to receive intranasally 24. IU oxytocin or placebo. Cortisol was measured at several times before and after a social stressor (public speaking). Individuals with impaired ERA showed a reduced cortisol response to stress after oxytocin but an increased cortisol response after placebo application. The results suggest that healthy individuals with low ERA benefit from intranasal oxytocin application. Neurobiological mechanisms potentially underlying the link between oxytocin, cortsiol and ERA are discussed against the background of a neuroendocrinological perspective on personality. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The current study examined the role of perceived social isolation in moderating the effects of oxytocin on cardiac autonomic control in humans. Intranasal administration of 20 IU oxytocin resulted in a significant increase in autonomic (parasympathetic and sympathetic) cardiac control. Specifically, oxytocin increased high frequency heart rate variability, a relatively pure measure of parasympathetic cardiac control, and decreased pre-ejection period, a well-validated marker of enhanced sympathetic cardiac control. Derived metrics of autonomic co-activity and reciprocity revealed that oxytocin significantly increased overall autonomic cardiac control. Furthermore, the effects of oxytocin on cardiac autonomic control were significantly associated with loneliness ratings. Higher levels of loneliness were associated with diminished parasympathetic cardiac reactivity to intranasal oxytocin. The effects of OT on autonomic cardiac control were independent of any effects on circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine or stress hormone levels. Thus, lonely individuals may be less responsive to the salubrious effects of oxytocin on cardiovascular responsivity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Introduction: Intranasal oxytocin attenuates cortisol levels during social stress inductions. However, no research to date has documented the dose-response relation between intranasal oxytocin administration and cortisol, and researchers examining intranasal oxytocin have not examined the cortisol response to physical stress. We therefore examined the effects of 24IU and 48IU of intranasal oxytocin on the cortisol response to vigorous exercise. Method: Seventeen males participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and within-subject experiment. Participants engaged in vigorous exercise for 60. min following the administration of placebo or intranasal oxytocin on three occasions. Saliva samples and mood ratings were collected at eight intervals across each session. Results: Salivary cortisol concentrations changed over time, peaking after 60min of exercise (quadratic: F(1,16)=7.349, p=.015, partial ??2=.32). The 24IU dose of oxytocin attenuated cortisol levels relative to placebo (F(1,16)=4.496, p=.05, partial ??2=.22) and the 48IU dose, although the latter fell just short of statistical significance (F(1,16)=3.054, p=.10, partial ??2=.16). There was no difference in the cortisol response to exercise in participants who were administered 48IU of intranasal oxytocin relative to placebo. Intranasal oxytocin had no effect on mood. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that the effect of intranasal oxytocin on salivary cortisol is dose-dependent, and that intranasal oxytocin attenuates cortisol levels in response to physical stress. Future research using exogenous oxytocin will need to consider the possibility of dose-response relations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In contrast, less than 29{\%} of the non-U.K. subjects had FB memories 1 year later; memory reports in this group were characterized by forgetting, reconstructive errors, and confabulatory responses. A causal analysis of secondary variables showed that the formation of FB memories was primarily associated with the level of importance attached to the event and level of affective response to the news.

This tension is examined in relation to each SMS component—the episodic memory system, long-term self, and the working self. The long-term self, a new aspect of the model, consists of the interaction of the autobiographical knowledge base and the conceptul self. The working self, depending on goal activity status, mediates between epi- sodic memory and the long-term self. Applications of the SMS to personality and clinical psychology are provided through analysis of self-defining memo- ries and adult attachment categories, as well as case histories of traumatic memory.

By the end of childhood, the self has become a motivated agent, too, as personal goals, motives, values, and envisioned projects for the future become central features of how the I conceives of the Me. A third layer of selfhood begins to form in the adolescent and emerging adulthood years, when the self as autobiographical author aims to construct a story of the Me, to provide adult life with broad purpose and a dynamic sense of temporal continuity. An integrative theory that envisions the psychological self as a developing I–Me configuration of actor, agent, and author helps to synthesize a wide range of conceptions and findings on the self from social, personality, cognitive, cultural, and developmental psychology and from sociology and other social sciences. The actor–agent–author framework also sheds new light on studies of self-regulation, self-esteem, self-continuity, and the relationship between self and culture.},

Consistent with the literature, the self-defining memory differed significantly from the earliest childhood memory in terms of phenomenology, with the recency of the memory associated with more intense phenomenological experience. The self-defining memory took longer to retrieve and narrate than the earliest childhood memory. Meaningful differences also emerged between the two age groups: Participants in their 30s rated their self-defining memory as more vivid, coherent, and accessible than participants in their 20s.

abstract = {This study examines four dimensions of self-defining memory (specificity, meaning, content, and affect) and their relationship to self-restraint, distress, and defensiveness. The development and validation of a protocol for measuring specificity, meaning, and affect in self-defining memories is discussed. Specificity is operationalized as the temporal and detailed specificity of the narrative. Meaning refers to the participant's stepping back from the narrative to derive higher personal meaning or a life lesson. Affect reflects subjective emotion upon recall. Agreement between two raters scoring 1040 memories was kappa=.83 for specificity and kappa=.72 for meaning. The protocol is compatible with Thorne and McLean's scoring system for content (the types of events in memories). The current study compared individual differences in the four dimensions of 10 self-defining memories collected from 103 undergraduates to scores of self-restraint, distress, and repressive defensiveness, as measured by the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory. Memory specificity was inversely related to repressive defensiveness, while greater memory meaning was linked to moderate and high levels of self-restraint. Memory content and affect predicted individuals' degree of subjective distress. Based on these findings, the authors discuss the place of self-defining memories in Conway and Pleydell-Pearce's Self-Memory System model of autobiographical memory and personality, more generally.},

abstract = {In the current revival of interest in the emotional and mental lives of animals, many investigators have focused attention on mammalian infants that emit distress vocalizations when separated from the home environment. Perhaps the most intensively studied distress vocalization is the ultrasonic vocalization of infant rats. Since its discovery, this vocalization has been interpreted both as a communicatory signal for the elicitation of maternal retrieval and as the manifestation of emotional distress. In contrast, the authors examined the cardiovascular causes and consequences of the vocalization, and on the basis of this work, they hypothesized that the vocalization is the acoustic by-product of the abdominal compression reaction (ACR), a maneuver that results in increased venous return to the heart. Therefore, the vocalization may be analogous to a sneeze, serving a physiological function while incidentally producing sound.},

abstract = {There is a growing body of research indicating that bodily sensation and behavior strongly influences one's emotional reaction toward certain situations or objects. On this background, a framework model of embodied affectivity is suggested: we regard emotions as resulting from the circular interaction between affective qualities or affordances in the environment and the subject's bodily resonance, be it in the form of sensations, postures, expressive movements or movement tendencies. Motion and emotion are thus intrinsically connected: one is moved by movement (perception; impression; affection) and moved to move (action; expression; e-motion). Through its resonance, the body functions as a medium of emotional perception: it colors or charges self-experience and the environment with affective valences while it remains itself in the background of one's own awareness. This model is then applied to emotional social understanding or interaffectivity which is regarded as an intertwinement of two cycles of embodied affectivity, thus continuously modifying each partner's affective affordances and bodily resonance. We conclude with considerations of how embodied affectivity is altered in psychopathology and can be addressed in psychotherapy of the embodied self.},

This paper investigates effects of dynamic body feedback on affect and attitudes, focusing on the impact of movement rhythms with smooth vs. sharp reversals as one basic category of movement qualities. It relates those qualities to already explored effects of approach vs. avoidance motor behavior as one basic category of movement shape. Studies 1 and 2 tested the effects of one of two basic movement qualities (smooth vs. sharp rhythms) on affect and cognition. The third study tested those movement qualities in combination with movement shape (approach vs. avoidance motor behavior) and the effects of those combinations on affect and attitudes toward initially valence-free stimuli. Results suggest that movement rhythms influence affect (studies 1 and 2), and attitudes (study 3), and moderate the impact of approach and avoidance motor behavior on attitudes (study 3). Extending static body feedback research with a dynamic account, findings indicate that movement qualities - next to movement shape - play an important role, when movement of the lived body is an independent variable.},

Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system.

Independent variables included position of speech (pro, anti, or equivocal), choice of position vs. assignment of position, and reference group of target person. The major hypothesis (which was confirmed with varying strength in all three experiments) was that choice would make a greater difference when there was a low prior probability of someone taking the position expressed in the speech. Other findings of interest were: (1) a tendency to attribute attitude in line with behavior, even in no-choice conditions; (2) increased inter-individual variability in conditions where low probability opinions were expressed in a constraining context; (3) that this variability was partly a function of the subjects' own attitudes on the issue; (4) that equivocation in no-choice conditions leads to the attribution that the equivocator opposes the assigned position.

abstract = {In a trans-paradigm theoretical synthesis of cognitive dissonance research, we examined theoretical variables (e. g., choice, consequences, etc.) and their relationships with dissonance effect sizes. We used structural equation analyses, performed within and across five research paradigms (induced compliance, insufficient justification, disconfirmed expectancies, selective exposure, and free choice), and corresponding to major versions of cognitive dissonance theory, to test several theoretically derived models. None of these models supported Festinger's notion that discomfort mediates dissonance effects. Consistent with conceptualisation of guilt as the drive component of dissonance theory, guilt strongly predicted dissonance effect sizes, virtually irrespective of which model was tested. A theory integrating the guilt and dissonance theories is stronger than either set of theories in isolation.},
annote = {Although Festinger postulated that dissonance has motivational properties, he provided little elaboration on the phenomenological or physiological nature of the dissonance motivational construct

Dissonance as an intervening variable.
intervening variable refers to a variable that ‘‘has no factual content''—no phenomenological or biological referent (MacCorquodale and Meehl (1948)): An intervening variable is a theoretical heuristic that is used to organise a set of empirical relationships

In accord with this intervening variable view of dissonance, some have argued that no ‘‘drive'' concept of any kind is theoretically necessary

Dissonance as a hypothetical construct
MacCorquodale andMeehl (1948) invoked the term hypothetical construct to refer to internal states that are presumed to have measurable biological and/or phenomenological meaning

implying instead that dissonance is in fact a biological drive state. ‘‘it is assumed that cognitive dissonance energizes and directs behavior – the two essential functions of a drive'', 

but concludes that ‘‘no direct tests of the assumption that dissonance is drive producing have thus far been made'' Zajonc (1968)

Thus, if dissonance is indeed a drive, its reduction should result in reinforcement and thereby enable researchers to shape new behaviours using dissonance reduction as the reward.

Elliot and Devine (1994, p. 382) argue that Brehm and Cohen ‘‘proffered a restatement of cognitive dissonance theory in which they distinctly characterized dissonance as a state of arousal and focused extensively on its drive-like properties'


leads me to perform dissonance-reducing behavior is my having done something that 
(a) astonishes me, 
(b) makes me feel stupid, or 
(c) makes me feel guilty'' (Aronson, 1992, p. 305).

According to self-affirmation theory (Steele 1988), dissonance is aroused by an inconsistency between one's counter- attitudinal behaviour and one's view of oneself as a moral individual with integrity. The major distinguishing element of Steele's theory is that it adds another route to dissonance reduction—self reaffirmation


CONSEQUENCES
the cumulative record is clear: dissonance-arousing acts with high consequences arouse more dissonance than do acts with low consequences (see reviews by Collins {\&} Hoyt, 1972; Cooper {\&} Fazio, 1984; Stone {\&} Cooper, 2001)

external attribution for the dissonance-inducing act or event, and internal attribution for the dissonance-inducing act or event

dissonance-predicted phenomena would occur only when an internal attribution is made.

Some have argued that dissonance is phenomenologically invisible (e.g., Nisbett {\&} Wilson, 1977)—a component of automatic cognitive processing not amenable to conscious introspection

Our readings of various theoretical elaborations on the nature of the dissonance ‘‘drive'' led us to ask our judges to estimate separately the likelihood that the experimental manipulations would create feelings of
- general psychological discomfort, 
- guilt, and 
- embarrassment.

INDUCED COMPLIANCE
In the induced compliance paradigm either small or large incentives are offered to perform counter-attitudinal behaviour

performing counter-attitudinal behaviours produces cognitions that are dissonant with prior beliefs and cognitions about morality, provided that there is little external justification for having performed the behaviour.

reduce dissonance in such a situation, for example, by adding consonant cognitions (endorsement of the counter-attitudinal behaviour), by removing dissonant cognitions, or reducing their importance (e.g., trivialising or denying the immorality)

Alternatively, dissonance may be reduced by seeking social support for one's counter-attitudinal behaviour, thereby increasing consonant cognitions (Lepper, Zanna, {\&} Abelson, 1970; McKimmie et al., 2003; Stroebe {\&} Diehl, 1981)

Apart from external justification for behaviour, other variables manipulated in studies of induced compliance include 
- choice per se (e.g., Jones {\&} Brehm, 1967), 
- publicness of the behaviour (e.g., Helmreich {\&} Collins, 1968), 
- commitment (e.g., Beauvois et al., 1995), 
- aversive consequences (e.g., Harmon-Jones et al., 1996; Scher {\&} Cooper, 1989), and 
- physiological arousal (e.g., Croyle {\&} Cooper, 1983; Zanna {\&} Cooper, 1974)

INSUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION: "marshmallow test"
either small or large punishments are threatened as consequences for performing externally forbidden, yet personally desirable, behaviours.

As a subset of induced compliance this paradigm also challenged Hovland et al.'s (1953) learning theory by predicting that stronger punishments will be weaker inhibitors of subsequent attitude (and behaviour) change than will relatively more benign punishments.

Theoretically, dissonance is aroused when a person refrains from
performing a forbidden, but desirable, behaviour when there is little external justification (i.e., mild threat of punishment) for such behavioural restraint, because not performing the behaviour is contrary to the high ranking that the toy received. Compared with this is a situation in which there is relatively sufficient external justification for behavioural restraint (i.e., severe threat of punishment), arousing relatively little dissonance because the strong external justification allows no choice other than restraint.

JUSTIFICATION OF EFFORT
Aronson and Mills (1959) exposure to a highly embarrassing initiation procedure for joining a social group produced more liking for the group than a less-embarrassing initiation (for a replication see Gerard {\&} Mathewson, 1966).

Aronson and Mills found that those required to read obscenities and erotic passages rated the pre-recorded discussion as more interesting and worthwhile than did those in the control condition

Subsequent research (e.g., Axsom {\&} Cooper, 1985; Cooper, 1980; Linder {\&} Worchel, 1970; Rosenfeld, Giacalone, {\&} Tedeschi, 1984; Shaffer {\&} Hendrick, 1971) showed that 
more-effortful, or 
more severely counter-attitudinal or 
aversive behaviour 
consequently produced more attitude change than did less-effortful counter-attitudinal or aversive behaviour, presumably because it had more strongly aroused dissonance

DISCONFIRMED EXPECTANCIES
Festinger et al. (1956) observed what happened in a religious cult when its prophesied widespread flood and rescue spaceship failed to materialise. Following a failure of the prophecy, they found that the religious group members not only maintained their beliefs, but actually increased their proselytising activities to recruit others to the group

The only exception was for those members who waited alone for the flood. In their case, without the social support for their initial position, they abandoned their beliefs and left the group

SELECTIVE EXPOSURE
participants avoid information that is dissonant with their attitude position, seek out information that is consonant with their position, or both


the role of judged guilt in uniquely
predicting dissonance effect sizes was ubiquitously robust (with the exception of the free choice paradigm, as noted above)

It may mean that guilt was a variable that was inadvertently concomitant with many other variables, and can thus be seen as a confounded variable. 

Alternatively, dissonance can be seen as a motivational state that is most strongly induced when the cognitions involve a discrepancy between present behaviour and standards for behaviour—the formula for guilt—as suggested not only by several dissonance researchers (e.g., Aronson, 1992; Steele, 1988) but also by proponents of Objective Self-Awareness theory (e.g.,Wicklund {\&} Duval, 1972)

Festinger's original thinking posited importance of cognitions as primary determinants of dissonance (see also Mills, 1999), and the current findings suggest that cognitions become more important to the degree that they are concerned with moral values and standards for behaviour},

It highlights various effects of the interaction on learning (including synergy effects). The authors argue for an integrated model of skill learning that takes into account both implicit and explicit processes. Moreover, they argue for a bottom-up approach (first learning implicit knowledge and then explicit knowledge) in the integrated model. A variety of qualitative data can be accounted for by the approach. A computational model, CLARION, is then used to simulate a range of quantitative data. The results demonstrate the plausibility of the model, which provides a new perspective on skill learning.},

We trained 308 observers on a complex dynamic visual scene task void of context and motor control requirements3 and demonstrate that professionals as a group dramatically differ from high-level amateur athletes, who dramatically differ from non-athlete university students in their capacity to learn such stimuli. This demonstrates that a distinguishing factor explaining the capacities of professional athletes is their ability to learn how to process complex dynamic visual scenes. This gives us an insight as to what is so special about the elite athletes' mental abilities, which allows them to express great prowess in action.},

abstract = {Historically, the ability of coaches to prescribe training to achieve optimal athletic performance can be attributed to many years of personal experience. A more modern approach is to adopt scientific methods in the development of optimal training programmes. However, there is not much research in this area, particularly into the quantification of training programmes and their effects on physiological adaptation and subsequent performance. Several methods have been used to quantify training load, including questionnaires, diaries, physiological monitoring and direct observation. More recently, indices of training stress have been proposed, including the training impulse, which uses heart rate measurements and training load, and session rating of perceived exertion measurements, which utilizes subjective perception of effort scores and duration of exercise. Although physiological adaptations to training are well documented, their influence on performance has not been accurately quantified. To date, no single physiological marker has been identified that can measure the fitness and fatigue responses to exercise or accurately predict performance. Models attempting to quantify the relationship between training and performance have been proposed, many of which consider the athlete as a system in which the training load is the input and performance the system output. Although attractive in concept, the accuracy of these theoretical models has proven poor. A possible reason may be the absence of a measure of individuality in each athlete's response to training. Thus, in the future more attention should be directed towards measurements that reflect individual capacity to respond or adapt to exercise training rather than an absolute measure of changes in physiological variables that occur with training.},

abstract = {Although most people acknowledge the moral virtue in sacrificing oneself to save others, few actually endorse self-sacrifice. Seven experiments explored the cognitive and emotional mechanisms that underlie such endorsements. Participants responded to 1 of 2 moral dilemmas in which they could save 5 members of their country only by sacrificing themselves. Over 90{\%} of participants acknowledged that the moral course of action was to sacrifice oneself to save others (Experiment 1), yet only those who were strongly fused with the group preferentially endorsed self-sacrifice (Experiments 2-7). The presence of a concern with saving group members rather than the absence of a concern with self-preservation motivated strongly fused participants to endorse sacrificing themselves for the group (Experiment 3). Analyses of think aloud protocols suggested that saving others was motivated by emotional engagement with the group among strongly fused participants but by utilitarian concerns among weakly fused participants (Experiment 4). Hurrying participants' responses increased self-sacrifice among strongly fused participants but decreased self-sacrifice among weakly fused participants (Experiment 5). Priming the personal self increased endorsement of self-sacrifice among strongly fused participants but further reduced endorsement of self-sacrifice among weakly fused participants (Experiment 6). Strongly fused participants ignored utilitarian considerations, but weakly fused persons endorsed self-sacrifice more when it would save more people (Experiment 7). Apparently, the emotional engagement with the group experienced by strongly fused persons overrides the desire for self-preservation and compels them to translate their moral beliefs into self-sacrificial behavior.

Fan Meizhong

Fan acknowledged on his blog that he knew that he should have helped his students evacuate. Yet, when the earthquake struck, he shouted “Stay calm, it's an earthquake!”

If merely recognizing that group members are in mortal danger is not enough to motivate many people to sacrifice themselves to save others, what does compel such actions?

We suggest further that the sense of connection experienced by strongly fused persons triggers emotional reactions to the plight of fellow group members, emotional reactions that motivate the decision to sacrifice their lives for these group members

IDENTITY FUSION:
when people become fused with a group, they theoretically experience a visceral sense of “oneness” with that group

This sense of oneness involves the union of the personal self (viz., idiosyncratic features of the individual) and a social self (viz., features the individual shares with the group).

Difference with group identification:

A central difference between identification and fusion, however, involves the nature of the “glue” that bonds group members to the group.

Social identity formulations hold that group members are bound to one another through categorical ties that are based on the degree to which members embody the prototypic qualities of the group; the unique relationships that group members establish with one another are not regarded as an important contributor to identification. In fact, in the widely used “minimal-group paradigm,” participants become identified with the ingroup and biased against the outgroup despite never having encountered a single member of either group (e.g., Billig {\&} Tajfel, 1973; Turner, Sachdev, {\&} Hogg, 1983)

Fusion:
The presence of such relational ties means that fused persons view other group members as unique individuals rather than interchangeable members of the category.

These relational ties may contribute to feelings of family-like mutual obligation and shared strength.


effects of fusion could be amplified either by increasing people's:
physiological arousal
personal self-views
agency / responsibility 
relational/familial ties

evidence suggests that identity fusion is qualitatively distinct from social identification,
and that quality is emotional/visceral/relational.

EMOTION {\&} MORAL REASONING

Of particular relevance here, evidence that increasing physiological arousal amplifies the effect of fusion on pro-group behavior (Swann, G{\'{o}}mez, Huici, et al., 2010) suggests that people's emotional responses may play a role in motivating fused persons to enact pro-group behavior, including behaviors that have moral overtones.

researchers have now provided evidence for the importance of automatic, intuitive processes in moral behavior (Blair, 1995; Haidt, 2001; Pizarro {\&} Salovey, 2002).

A case in point is “moral dumbfounding,” in which people blithely endorse moral judgments that subsequent questioning re- veals they have no rational basis for having made (Haidt, 2001)

two separate mental systems govern moral decision making—
one that is rapid, automatic, and emotion-driven and 
another that is deliberate and logical (e.g., Greene, 2007, 2009; Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, {\&} Cohen, 2008; Lombrozo, 2009)

Whereas some moral judgments (viz., those involving deontologi- cal principles) were uniquely related to emotional processes such as empathic concerns and religiosity, other moral judgments (viz., those involving utilitarian principles) were uniquely related to need for cognition. 

just as a time-pressure manipulation selectively reduced adherence to utilitarian principles, an empathy enhancing manipulation selectively increased adherence to deontological principles (Conway {\&} Gawronski, 2013).

Here, we suggest that a dual process approach can also be used to illuminate the unique moral judgments of persons who are strongly versus weakly fused to their group:

That is, insofar as fusion taps a visceral feeling of oneness with the group, threats to other group members may activate the same emotions of tension, distress, and anxiety that they would experience were they them- selves in danger.

Moreover, these emotional reactions should compel them to apply deontological principles to the plight of their group members and resolve to save them. Among the many who decide to sacrifice themselves, the implications of their own death should come to mind only after contemplating the plight of the group.

Insofar as strongly fused persons experience a visceral feeling of oneness with other group members, when they learned that other group members were in grave danger, they should experience emotional reactions that would motivate them to save ingroup members from their plight.

Even if they fail to endorse sacrificing themselves, they should resolve to find another way to save the ingroup members.


Specifically, hurrying participants' responses should exaggerate the tendency for strongly fused people to endorse sacrificing themselves for ingroup members and for weakly fused people to save themselves at the expense of ingroup members.


A second implication of this analysis is that priming the personal self of participants should have opposite effects on strongly versus weakly fused persons.

That is, because fused persons have a visceral sense of oneness with the group, priming the personal self should simultaneously activate both selves.

SO WHAT ABOUT IN CHINA?? 

visceral sense of oneness with the group:

embodied fast-system reaction, as opposed to slow, epistemic vigilence reaction:
so: transient hypofrontality? 

A third implication of this analysis is that the strong relational ties that fused persons develop toward other in group members should prevent them from thinking of such individuals in utilitarian terms.

Ethics:
DEONTOLOGICAL
CONSEQUENTIAL
VIRTUE

Experiment 1{\&}2:

Participants who endorsed self-sacrifice indicated that it was the most moral of the two response options. Indeed, participants who endorsed saving themselves admitted that they had endorsed the less moral of the two options.

Apparently, identity fusion influences whether individuals are willing to act on what they feel they morally should do.

Experiment 3: Is Self-Sacrifice a Sacrifice for Strongly Fused People?

Devotion fully mediated the effects of fusion on endorsement of self-sacrifice (95{\%} CI [.0859, .6657])(“I am devoted to saving ingroup members,”
“I would kill to save members of my group,” and “Protecting the lives of ingroup members is really important to me.” 

(Responsibility; agency over the group; etc)

Experiment 4: “Think-Aloud” Protocols as a Window Into Thoughts and Emotions of Participants

Five distinct rationales for moral decisions:
1. Survival instinct
2. Distancing from victims
3. Emotional engagement with the group.
4. Utilitarianism 
5. Denial. (there's got to be a better way!)
6. other

- Among participants who chose to sacrifice themselves, strongly fused persons were especially likely to verbalize emotional engagement with the group rationales,
- whereas weakly fused participants were especially likely to verbalize utilitarian rationales, 

- among participants who chose to let five ingroup members die, strongly fused participants were especially likely to verbalize denial rationales
-whereas weakly fused participants were especially likely to verbalize survival instinct and distancing from victim's rationales

--{\textgreater} emotional engagement with the group partially mediated the effect of fusion on the response to the dilemma

Strongly fused endorsers of self-sacrifice responded with rationales that emphasized group-related emotions, explaining that it was upsetting to them that their group members were in such a predicament.

Many also noted an immediate impulse to forfeit their life to save the lives of the ingroup members


In contrast, among the few weakly fused participants who endorsed self- sacrifice, the decision emerged more slowly and was marked by utilitarian rationales—“Self-sacrifice is called for because the lives of five people are more valuable than the life of one.”


The mental gymnastics of strongly fused participants were especially intriguing. Even as they decided to consign the ingroup members to their deaths by refusing to endorse self-sacrifice, strongly fused participants denied that they were forsaking their ingroup members. Instead, they insisted that “there must be a different option!” or “the group members must be saved!”

In contrast, when weakly fused persons endorsed letting ingroup members perish, they in- sisted that they were, quite understandably, following their gut survival instincts.

They attempted to excuse their decision to prioritize their own survival over that of group members by at- tempting to distance themselves psychologically from the victims.


One way of contrasting the responses of strongly and weakly
fused participants is in terms of the content of their deontological and utilitarian impulses:

For strongly fused persons, their deonto- logical impulse was shaped by emotional distress associated with the possibility that several group members might die. This impulse often led them to endorse self-sacrifice.

For weakly fused persons, their deontological impulse was shaped by their survival instinct, an impulse that encouraged them to endorse self-preservation. When they resisted this impulse, their follow-up response was to engage in utilitarian reasoning, a pro- cess that led a limited number of weakly fused persons to endorse self-sacrifice.

If our participants were indeed motivated by quick, affect-laden, deontological impulses to either ensure the survival of their group members (strongly fused) or ensure their own survival (weakly fused), then manipulations that are designed to amplify deonto- logical impulses should exaggerate the characteristic responses of participants.

Experiment 5: Amplifying Fusion Effects Through Time Pressure

For strongly fused persons, their gut told them to save their group members; for weakly fused persons, their gut told them to save themselves. 



Experiment 6: Activating the Personal Versus Social Self

Focusing attention on either the personal or social self should amplify the tendency of fused persons to translate their pro-group sentiments into action.

because weakly fused persons lack a sense of oneness between the personal and social self, the only way to amplify their tendency to enact pro-group action is to focus attention on the social self

Predictions:
1. Insofar as strongly fused persons experience a visceral sense of oneness with the group, priming the personal self should simul- taneously activate their social and personal self, resulting in elevated levels of self-sacrifice for the group in both conditions relative to controls.

2. Insofar as weakly fused persons lack a visceral sense of oneness with the group, priming the social self should produce elevated levels of self-sacrifice relative to those in personal-self-activation and control conditions.

Is it perhaps the opposite with rugby players in China? 

Relational self activated by focussing on personal self;
Fused participants activated by talk of the team? 

This raises an intriguing question: What were our participants thinking and feeling? More specifically, what were the cognitive and emotional processes responsible for the moral resolve of fused individuals?

When they recognized that their group members were in danger, strongly fused persons immediately felt as if they themselves were in danger and it did not matter whether one or several ingroup members were threatened. At the same time, weakly fused persons focused on their own survival and endorsed the sacrifice of group members.

That is, disagreement from others in a group generates dissonance, and subsequent movement toward group consensus reduces this negative tension. The authors conducted 3 studies to demonstrate group-induced dissonance. In the first, students in a group with others who ostensibly disagreed with them experienced greater dissonance discomfort than those in a group with others who agreed. Study 2 demonstrated that standard moderators of dissonance in past research--lack of choice and opportunity to self-affirm, similarly reduced dissonance discomfort generated by group disagreement. In Study 3, the dissonance induced by group disagreement was reduced through a variety of interpersonal strategies to achieve consensus, including persuading others, changing one's own position, and joining an attitudinally congenial group.},

annote = {Festinger (1957), described dissonance as an intraindividual phenomenon in a social context

Dissonance is conceptualized as an aversive psychological drive state that we are motivated to reduce, much like hunger or thirst (there is some argument about whether dissonance as a drive exists or is merely a useful concept for predicting outcomes; see Kenworthy, Miller, Collins, Read, {\&} Earleywine, 2011)

It is the result of an inconsistency between two or more cognitions – that is, one cognition follows from the opposite of the other.According to Festinger (1957), dissonance can be reduced by changing one of the cognitions or generating new cogni- tions to restore consonance, or by downplaying the importance of the dissonance-arousing cognitions

Group Dissonance:
Stroebe and Diehl's (1981, 1988) studies focused on the dissonance-reducing function of group-related information. Participants were induced to write a counter-attitudinal essay and then were told about the behavior and (sometimes) the attitude of another participant who had been asked to write the same essay.

Stroebe and Diehl (1981) found that under conditions that elicit dissonance (i.e., behaving in a counter-attitudinal manner under conditions of high choice), participants' attitudes became more positive when theywere told that another participant had not written the essay compared towhen told that the other participant hadwritten the essay

Participants' attitudes becamemore positive after writing a counter-attitudinal essay when they were told that the other participant held the opposite attitude to them compared to when told that the other participant held the same attitude as themselves. Stroebe and Diehl interpreted these findings as suggesting that the attitudes and behaviors of others in the immediate social context acted as a social reward and so helped to reduce the need for dissonance reduction via attitude change, functionally much like the financial reward in Festinger and Carlsmith's(1959) study.

Stone,Wiegand, Cooper, and Aronson (1997): In their first study, participants experienced less dissonancewhen they were made mindful of the past behavioral failures of other people (i.e., when the behavior of otherswas the same as participants' own behavior) compared to when they were asked to fo- cus on their own past failures. In essence, when participantswere asked to think about the pres- ence of support for their behavior, they experienced less hypocrisy-induced dissonance

McKimmie et al. (2003): participants were made to feel hypocritical via a biased behavioral checklist. 
asked to think about themselves as individuals or as a member of a group that was either low or high in contextual salience. 

The presence or absence of social support had the greatest effect on attitude change when the shared group membership was made salient. 

Interestingly, the shared group identity also provided an additional avenue for dissonance reduction via reduced group identification when that group did not provide social support. Thus, it appeared that experiencing dissonance in the context of a group changed the arousal and reduction of dissonance. 

A similar conclusion can be drawn from research examining how members of a co-acting group experience dissonance:

DIFFUSION of RESPONSIBILITY
Zanna and Sande (1987) asked participants to write a counter-attitudinal essay that might bring about an aversive outcome. 

Conditions: 3 participants at a time either alone (individual essays) or in a group (one group essay). 

Predicitons: 
1. those acting counter-attitudinally in the group would be able to reduce dissonance by dif- fusing responsibility for the aversive counter-attitudinal behavior to the other group members
2. participants would see the group product as beingmore likely to produce aversive consequences

Results:
as predicted, participants changed their attitudes less in the group condition, but they also thought the group essay would be more persuasive (and so thereforemore likely to produce aversive consequences)

More responsibility more dissonance:
Further, the more the participants thought that the other group members were responsible for the essay, the less they changed their own attitudes. 

Social support (i.e., the co-acting group members), it appears, did not reduce dissonance by introducing consonant cognitions but rather via diffusion of responsibility for the aversive consequences of the counter-attitudinal behavior.

Counter-attitudinal behavior and norms:

Cl{\'{e}}mence (1990): social class of children in the forbidden toy paradigm
affected how they responded to the dissonance-inducing request to not play with an attractive toy. 
children from the lower class background derogated the attractive toy to a greater extent than children from the middle class background when the threat to not play with the toy was mild compared to severe.

Robertson and Reicher (1997): norms may reduce dissonancewhen they validate
the counter-attitudinal behavior or when they suggest that attitude–behavior inconsistency is normative. 

Identity contradiction model:
dissonance effects, particularly those in the induced compliance paradigm, were best understood from social identity theory (Tajfel, 1978; Tajfel {\&} Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, {\&}Wetherell, 1987).

Thus, dissonance effectswere cast as being context specific and ref lecting threats to social identity in several different ways.

Robertson (2006): found further evidence for the importance of norms for group con- sistency and for the utility of a social identity view of dissonance

Cooper andMackie (1983): found that the normativity of the attitude that behavior is inconsistent with inf luences how dissonance is reduced.

students who supported a particular presidential candidatewere asked to write an argument against their atti- tudes about that candidate under conditions of high or low choice.

This argument was either counter to a group-defining attitude or counter to a group-relevant attitude.

Results:
While dissonance was aroused for students in the free choice condition, the normativity of the attitude that they wrote against inf luenced howthey reduced their dissonance.

As predicted, those in the normative definitional attitude topic condition were not able to reduce their dissonance through attitude change.

Instead, they had to use some alternative dissonance reduction strategy – they derogated the relevant out-group that supported the alternative presidential candidate.

evidence for misattribution of the dissonance arousal to that out-group (see Zanna {\&} Cooper, 1974)

Cl{\'{e}}mence (1994): there are two levels of conf lict aroused by counter-attitudinal behavior – at the intraindividual level and at the intergroup level. The latter creates motivation to protect one's social identity and may limit the ability to reduce dissonance through attitude change.

Stone {\&} Cooper (2001): a deft blend of a personal self and a social self as being central to the arousal of dissonance.

highlights the importance of not only personal in- formation about the self but also social information and the context in which dissonance is experienced.

dissonance is arousedwhen there is a difference between actual self-attributes and normative standards for behavior.
(standards come from either self-knowledge or socially normative information. Behavior is compared to the standard that is made salient or accessible by cues in the current context)

Groups:
1. can reduce dissonance by: providing cognitions that are consonantwith one'scounter-attitudinal behavior – whether that is in the form of the behavior of other specific group members or more generally through a group norm 
2. can, at the same time, inhibit dissonance reduction, particularly when a person is attempting to reduce dissonance reduction through attitude change would run counter to im- portant group norms.

The Group: forced compliance, reproduction of group norms.

Groups might introduce consonant cognitions that reduce the amount of inconsistency via so- cial support, or theymight create an opportunity to share the responsibility for a bad outcomeor perhaps provide a social context in which to make sense of one's counter-attitudinal behavior via a group norm.

Related to via the principle of 
Meta-consistency (Mckimmie et al. 2009)
the attitude–behavior consistency of other group members is important for interpreting one'sown attitude–behavior consistency.

The degree to which the contrast between one's own inconsis- tency and another's inconsistency accentuates or attenuates perceptions of self-consistency de- termines the extent of dissonance arousal. 

important social groups provide a comparative context for one'sattitude–behavior discrepancy.

- meta-consistency lowest when there is no support for a specific behavior or attitude. If you are behaving counter-attitudinally and you are told that another person has not performed the same counter-attitudinal behavior (i.e., no social support), then that information strongly suggests that that person is behaving in an attitude-consistent manner.

The diffusion of responsibility paradigm more directly inf luences the level of meta-consistency – members of group working on a joint product are aware that others are also behaving inconsistently (high meta-consistency).

the meta-consistency perspective builds on the self-standards model by explicitly recognizing that group norms can also serve to reduce dissonance through a number of mechanisms.

Is meta-consistency a meta-cognitive or serial thought process? 

meta-cognitive process: likely that actors will be affected either by the information about the consistency of other groupmem- bers' attitudes and behaviors or by the content of those attitudes, behaviors, and associated norms but not both.

serial: The meaning of the attitudes, behaviors, and norms may be considered first, followed by the meta-consistency information if that first step is not successful at reducing dissonance

(Such a possibility suggests that actors are highly motivated to reduce dissonance and actively use social information in multiple ways to attempt to alleviate the experience of dissonance rather than being relatively passive perceivers who are limited by what is initially made salient in the current social context.)

As such, although groups can be a source of dissonance arousal, these additional options for dissonance reduction tip the scales in favor of groups providing an overall benefit in terms of the experience of dissonance. This may be one important reason that individuals seek to belong to groups.

Group Dissonance and the Consistent Perceiver

Group attitudes and behaviors:
groups may create dissonance by introducing new cognitions that are inconsistent with a person's existing cognitions (Festinger).

1. through attitudes of other group members

The effect of groupmembers' attitudes:
(Matz{\&}Wood, 2005): students reported more discomfort when they thought about a group that disagreed with their attitudes. 
They also found in a follow-up study that this effectwas moderated by the level of free choice, which is a standard moderator of dissonance effects.
A final study suggested that group consensus after the initial disagreement was effective at reducing dissonance. 
Interestingly, subsequent research (Matz, Hofstedt, {\&} Wood, 2008) suggests that the effect of group disagreement is somewhat dependent on one's personality. 
Introverts appear to be more susceptible to the effect of group disagreement than extraverts.

2. through behaviors of other group members:

Glasford, Pratto, and Dovidio (2008) termed this intragroup dissonance and adopted a social identity framework (Tajfel, 1978).

groups may create dissonance when there is a discrepancy between a group member's personal values and the behavior of the ingroup, regardless of that individual's role in the group's behavior.

The results of two experiments supported such an idea and also showed that the group membership not only did create dissonance but also did provide strategies for group members to reduce their dissonance.

Group memberswho had an important value violated by the behavior of the group were able to reduce dissonance by either reducing their identification with the group (as in McKimmie et al.'s, 2003 study) or engaging in pro-value activism.

Further evidence that social identity is at the center of intragroup dissonance and that intragroup dissonance is distinct fromcollective guilt can be seen in their subsequent work (Glasford, Dovidio, {\&} Pratto, 2009): higher group identification tended to make group identity enhancement strategies more effective and more likely to be chosen.

Norms as a source of dissonance

"Vicarious dissonance"

Norton, Monin, Cooper, and Hogg (2003):

first study found that participants changed their attitudes to apparently reduce dissonance when participants heard about another student who had acted inconsistently, but only when the other student came from the same group as participants, and participants themselves identified with that group

second study showed that attitude change was due to vicarious dissonance and not simply due to being persuaded by the other student's counter-attitudinal speech (see also Monin, Norton, Cooper, {\&} Hogg, 2004).

A third study showed that the effect was moderated by the standard moderators of cognitive dissonance – freedom of choice and the presence of aversive consequences.

Thus, groups appear to create dissonance in the absence of attitude–behavior inconsistency
by making salient cognitions about the behaviors and attitudes of other group members that are inconsistent with one's own attitudes or behaviors.

LEADERS?

failing to meet a salient normative standard can create dissonance even if that failure is not inconsistent with one's own attitudes. 

RATCHET-EFFECT of group environments - dissonance motivates continual action in the direction of group norms...

Conclusions:

groups affect the arousal and reduction of dissonance either 
1. through the meaning or content of the specific attitudes, behaviors, and norms associated with the group
2. or through the meta-relationship between one's own attitude–behavior consistency and the attitude–behavior consistency of other groupmembers.},

abstract = {According to many modern economic theories, actions simply reflect an individual's preferences, whereas a psychological phenomenon called "cognitive dissonance" claims that actions can also create preference. Cognitive dissonance theory states that after making a difficult choice between two equally preferred items, the act of rejecting a favorite item induces an uncomfortable feeling (cognitive dissonance), which in turn motivates individuals to change their preferences to match their prior decision (i.e., reducing preference for rejected items). Recently, however, Chen and Risen [Chen K, Risen J (2010) J Pers Soc Psychol 99:573-594] pointed out a serious methodological problem, which casts a doubt on the very existence of this choice-induced preference change as studied over the past 50 y. Here, using a proper control condition and two measures of preferences (self-report and brain activity), we found that the mere act of making a choice can change self-report preference as well as its neural representation (i.e., striatum activity), thus providing strong evidence for choice-induced preference change. Furthermore, our data indicate that the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tracked the degree of cognitive dissonance on a trial-by-trial basis. Our findings provide important insights into the neural basis of how actions can alter an individual's preferences.},

abstract = {After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it.},

abstract = {To what extent do we know our own minds when making decisions? Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide range of domains, from mainstream experimental psychology (cognition, perception, social behavior) to cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics. A pervasive view places a heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive unconscious, with many theories assigning causally effective roles to unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework for evaluating these claims and reviews evidence from three major bodies of research in which unconscious factors have been studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation without attention, and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming (subliminal and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also given brief consideration. The review highlights that inadequate procedures for assessing awareness, failures to consider artifactual explanations of "landmark" results, and a tendency to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our intuitions have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision making. The review concludes by recommending that future research should focus on tasks in which participants' attention is diverted away from the experimenter's hypothesis, rather than the highly reflective tasks that are currently often employed.},

We therefore expected subjects to change their attitude toward the unchosen alternative, deeming it less valuable. We then presented subjects with a choice between the unchosen option and an option that was originally as attractive as both options in the first choice. Both groups preferred the novel over the unchosen option in this experimental condition, but not in a control condition in which they did not take part in the first decision.

Participants returned the following day to make "remember," "know," or "new" judgments for a mix of 72 new and previously seen faces. Results: Oxytocin-administered participants were more likely to make remember and know judgments for previously seen happy faces compared with angry and neutral human faces. In contrast, oxytocin did not influence judgments for faces that had not been presented previously. Conclusions: This study shows that the administration of oxytocin to male humans enhances the encoding of positive social information to make it more memorable. Results suggest that oxytocin could enhance social approach, intimacy, and bonding in male humans by strengthening encoding to make the recall of positive social information more likely. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Oxytocin had differential effects on the activity of specific amygdala subregions. On the one hand, it attenuated activation in lateral and dorsal regions of the anterior amygdala for fearful faces but enhanced activity for happy expressions, thus indicating a shift of the processing focus toward positive social stimuli. On the other hand, oxytocin increased the likelihood of reflexive gaze shifts toward the eye region irrespective of the depicted emotional expression. This gazing pattern was related to an increase of activity in the posterior amygdala and an enhanced functional coupling of this region to the superior colliculi.

Research from lesion and functional neuroimaging studies on remote episodic, semantic and spatial memory in humans is crucial for evaluating three theories of hippocampal and/or medial temporal lobe-neocortical interaction in memory retention and retrieval: cognitive map theory, standard consolidation theory and multiple trace theory. Each theory makes different predictions regarding first, the severity and extent of retrograde amnesia following lesions to some or all of the structures mentioned; second, the extent of activation of these structures to retrieval of memory across time; and third, the type of memory being retrieved. Each of these theories has strengths and weaknesses, and there are various unresolved issues. We propose a unified account based on multiple trace theory. This theory states that the hippocampus is needed for re-experiencing detailed episodic and spatial memories no matter how old they are, and that it contributes to the formation and assimilation of semantic memories and schematic spatial maps. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) offers reliable assessment of cardiovascular autonomic responses, providing a 'window' onto the interaction of peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Alterations in HRV are associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes, and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found lower resting HRV in patients compared to controls, suggesting increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tone. This article describes the analysis of HRV at rest and after psychological stress in panic disorder (PD) patients, in an enlarged sample of PTSD patients, and in healthy control subjects. Standardized heart rate (HR) analysis was carried out in 14 PTSD patients, 11 PD patients and 25 matched controls. ECG recordings were made while subjects were resting ('rest 1'), while recalling the trauma implicated in PTSD, or the circumstances of a severe panic attack, as appropriate ('recall'), and again while resting ('rest 2'). Controls were asked to recall a stressful life event during recall. While both patient groups had elevated HR and low frequency (LF) components of HRV at baseline (suggesting increased sympathetic activity), PTSD patients, unlike PD patients and controls, failed to respond to the recall stress with increases in HR and LF. HRV analysis demonstrates significant differences in autonomic regulation of PTSD and PD patients compared to each other and to control subjects. HRV analysis may augment biochemical studies of peripheral measures in these disorders.},

The cardiorespiratory responses of 34 GAD clients and 32 nonanxious control subjects were recorded during resting baseline, relaxation, and worry periods. Results indicated differences between GAD subjects and controls as well as among baseline, relaxation, and worry periods. GAD clients exhibited shorter cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) and lower high frequency spectral power across all task conditions. Relative to baseline and relaxation conditions, worry was associated with (1) shorter IBIs, (2) smaller mean successive differences (MSD) of the cardiac IBIs, and (3) lower high frequency spectral power. These findings suggest that GAD and its cardinal feature (worry), are associated with lower cardiac vagal control. The findings of the present study provide evidence for the utility of further exploration of the role of autonomic nervous system activity in GAD.},

abstract = {Declarative memory is usually described as consisting of two systems: semantic and episodic memory. Between these two poles, however, may lie a third entity: personal semantics (PS). PS concerns knowledge of one's past. Although typically assumed to be an aspect of semantic memory, it is essentially absent from existing models of knowledge. Furthermore, like episodic memory (EM), PS is idiosyncratically personal (i.e., not culturally-shared). We show that, depending on how it is operationalized, the neural correlates of PS can look more similar to semantic memory, more similar to EM, or dissimilar to both. We consider three different perspectives to better integrate PS into existing models of declarative memory and suggest experimental strategies for disentangling PS from semantic and episodic memory. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
annote = {EM entails recol- lecting unique events within their specific spatio-temporal context, imbued with a sense of the self mentally traveling through time to re-experience the original event.

By contrast, semantic memory pertains to culturally-shared general knowledge (including facts and vocabulary), de- tached from its context of acquisition and devoid of any subjective sense of mental time travel (Binder {\&} Desai 2011)

these systems have largely been investigated in isolation, leading to an under-appreciation of their interactions and of potentially intermediate forms of memory

Personal Semantics:
this type of memory was described in patients who could retrieve few or no EMs, yet showed knowledge of events from their personal past [4–7], resembling a ‘skeleton autobiography' [5] that seemed ‘to be drawn entirely from a personal pool of generalized knowledge'

The paradox of PS is that it is highly personal (like EM), yet, at the same time, devoid of any subjective sense of recollection and detached from its context of acquisition (like semantic memory)},

abstract = {Abstract Psychological resilience is important in sport because athletes must utilise and optimise a range of mental qualities to withstand the pressures that they experience. In this article, we discuss psychological resilience in sport performers via a review of the stressors athletes encounter and the protective factors that help them withstand these demands. It is hoped that synthesising what is known in these areas will help researchers gain a deeper profundity of resilience in sport, and also provide a rigorous and robust foundation for the development of a sport-specific measure of resilience. With these points in mind, we divided the narrative into two main sections. In the first section, we review the different types of stressors encountered by sport performers under three main categories: competitive, organisational and personal. Based on our recent research examining psychological resilience in Olympics champions, in the second section we discuss the five main families of psychological factors (viz. positive personality, motivation, confidence, focus, perceived social support) that protect the best athletes from the potential negative effect of stressors. It is anticipated that this review will help sport psychology researchers examine the interplay between stressors and protective factors, which will, in turn, focus the analytical lens on the processes underlying psychological resilience in athletes.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system (ANS) integrates afferent and motor activity for homeostatic processes including pain. The aim of the study was to compare hitherto poorly characterised relations between brainstem autonomic control and personality in response to visceral and somatic pain. Eighteen healthy subjects (16 females, mean age 34) had recordings during rest and pain of heart rate (HR), cardiac vagal tone (CVT), cardiac sensitivity to baroreflex (CSB), skin conductance level (SC), cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) and mean blood pressure (MBP). Visceral pain was induced by balloon distension in proximal (PB) and distal (DB) oesophagus and somatic pain by nail-bed pressure (NBP). Eight painful stimuli were delivered at each site and unpleasantness and intensity measured. Personality was profiled with the Big Five inventory. (1) Oesophageal intubation evoked "fight-flight" responses: HR and sympathetic (CSI, SC, MBP) elevation with parasympathetic (CVT) withdrawal (p {\textless} 0.05). (2) Pain at all sites evoked novel parasympathetic/sympathetic co-activation with elevated HR but vasodepression (all p {\textless} 0.05). (3) Personality traits correlated with slope of distal oesophageal pain-related CVT changes wherein more neurotic-introvert subjects had greater positive pain-related CVT slope change (neuroticism r 0.8, p {\textless} 0.05; extroversion r -0.5, p {\textless} 0.05). Pain-evoked heart rate increases were mediated by parasympathetic and sympathetic co-activation - a novel finding in humans but recently described in mammals too. Visceral pain-related parasympathetic change correlated with personality. ANS defence responses are nuanced and may relate to personality type for visceral pain.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Self-determination theory has proven to be a useful theoretical explanation of the occurrence of ill-being on a variety of accounts. Self-determination theory may also provide a useful explanation of the occurrence of athlete burnout. To date, limited evidence exists to support links between motivation and burnout. PURPOSE: To examine relationships and potential causal directions among burnout and types of motivation differing in degree of self-determination. METHOD: Data were collected on burnout using the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire and Sport Motivation Scale from 392 top amateur male rugby players. Structural equation modeling procedures were employed to evaluate a measurement model and three conceptually grounded structural models. One conceptual model specified concomitant (noncausal) relationships between burnout and motivations varying in self-determination. The other conceptual models specified causal pathways between burnout and the three motivation variables considered in the investigation (i.e., intrinsic motivation, external regulation, and amotivation). RESULTS: Within the models, amotivation, the least self-determined type of motivation, had a large positive association with burnout. Externally regulated motivation had trivial and nonsignificant relationships with burnout. Self-determined forms of motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation) exhibited significant negative associations with burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Overall the results support the potential utility of a self-determination theory explanation of burnout. As all models displayed reasonable and comparable fits, further research is required to establish the nature (concomitant vs directional causal vs reciprocal causal) of the relationship between burnout and motivation.},

abstract = {Declining learning and memory function is associated with the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. As in humans, chronic stress or depression in animals is accompanied by hippocampal dysfunction, and neurogenesis is correspondingly down regulated, in part, by the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as glutamatergic and serotonergic networks. Antidepressants can reverse this effect over time but one of the most clinically effective moderators of stress or depression and robust stimulators of neurogenesis is simple voluntary physical exercise such as running. Curiously, running also elevates circulating stress hormone levels yet neurogenesis is doubled in running animals. In evaluating the signalling that running provides to the central nervous system in mice, we have found that peripheral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is necessary for the effects of running on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Peripheral blockade of VEGF abolished running-induced neurogenesis but had no detectable effect on baseline neurogenesis in non-running animals. These data suggest that VEGF is an important element of a 'somatic regulator' of adult neurogenesis and that these somatic signalling networks can function independently of the central regulatory networks that are typically considered in the context of hippocampal neurogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity may help maintain cognitive function and decrease dementia risk, but epidemiological findings remain controversial. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between leisure-time physical activity at midlife and the subsequent development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Participants were randomly selected from the survivors of a population-based cohort previously surveyed in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. 1449 persons (72.5{\%}) age 65-79 years participated in the re-examination in 1998 (mean follow-up, 21 years). 117 persons had dementia and 76 had AD. Multiple logistic regression methods were used to analyse the association between leisure-time physical activity and dementia or AD. FINDINGS: Leisure-time physical activity at midlife at least twice a week was associated with a reduced risk of dementia and AD (odds ratio [OR] 0.48 [95{\%} CI 0.25-0.91] and 0.38 [0.17-0.85], respectively), even after adjustments for age, sex, education, follow-up time, locomotor disorders, APOE genotype, vascular disorders, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The associations were more pronounced among the APOE epsilon4 carriers. INTERPRETATION: Leisure-time physical activity at midlife is associated with a decreased risk of dementia and AD later in life. Regular physical activity may reduce the risk or delay the onset of dementia and AD, especially among genetically susceptible individuals.},

Method: Following an incremental test to exhaustion to determine exercise intensities, 12 male participants completed simple and choice reaction tests on a cycle ergometer where both reaction time and movement time were measured, with each test being performed on a separate day. Tests were performed at rest, moderate, heavy and severe intensities. Result: For reaction time, a 2-way (reaction time complexity ?? exercise intensity) repeated measures Analysis of Variance demonstrated a significant interaction effect (p= 0.02) and polynomial contrasts demonstrated a linear effect for choice reaction time (p{\textless} 0.05) (where choice reaction time decreased with increasing exercise intensity), but no significant effect for simple reaction time. For movement time, polynomial contrasts for exercise intensity showed a significant quadratic effect (p= 0.01) (with movement time fastest in the moderate to heavy domains). There was a significant main effect for complexity in both reaction (p{\textless} 0.001) and movement (p= 0.002) time.

All of these behaviours are enjoyable and represent pleasant experiences with a high reward value. Remarkably, rewarding behaviours activate the same brain circuits that mediate the positive reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse and of other forms of addiction, such as gambling and food addiction. Given the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in a variety of physiological functions of the nervous system, it is not surprising that it takes part in the complex machinery that regulates gratification and perception of pleasure. In this review, we focus first on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the modulation of neural activity and synaptic functions in brain regions that are involved in natural and nonnatural rewards (namely, the ventral tegmental area, striatum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex). Then, we examine the role of the endocannabinoid system in modulating behaviours that directly or indirectly activate these brain reward pathways. More specifically, current knowledge of the effects of the pharmacological manipulation of the endocannabinoid system on natural (eating, sexual behaviour, parenting, and social play) and pathological (gambling) rewarding behaviours is summarised and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Primate societies are characterized by bonded social relationships of a kind that are rare in other mammal taxa. These bonded relationships, which provide the basis for coalitions, are underpinned by an endorphin mechanism mediated by social grooming. However, bonded relationships of this kind impose constraints on the size of social groups that are possible. When ecological pressures have demanded larger groups, primates have had to evolve new mechanisms to facilitate bonding. This has involved increasing the size of vocal and visual communication repertoires, increasing the time devoted to social interaction and developing a capacity to manage two-tier social relationships (strong and weak ties). I consider the implications of these constraints for the evolution of human social communities and argue that laughter was an early evolutionary innovation that helped bridge the bonding gap between the group sizes characteristic of chimpanzees and australopithecines and those in later hominins.},
annote = {bonded relationships, which provide the basis for coalitions, are underpinned by an endorphin mechanism mediated by social grooming.

When ecological pressures have demanded larger groups, primates have had to evolve new mechanisms to facilitate bonding:

1. vocal and visual communication repertoires, 
2. increasing the time devoted to social interaction and 
3. developing a capacity to manage two-tier social relation- ships (strong and weak ties).

Laughter helped bridge the bonding gap

bonded: groups in which pairs of individuals have close, long-lasting relationships, marked in primates at least by persistent physical proximity and intense, focused social grooming that is often nearly exclusive to that dyad

Themammalian families with the highest encephalization rates (notably the Primates, theTylopods (camel family), the Hippomorphs (horse family), the Odontocetes (dolphin family) and the Caniniformes (dog family)) are all characterized by high proportions of living species with bonded social systems [1]. 

However, among these, the anthropoid primates stand out as being both un- usually encephalized and characterized by social systems that arealmost all of thebondedtype[1,2]

What seems to define these bonded social systems is the intensity of the relationships between pairs of individuals [3]

These bonded relationships exist to buffer the individuals concerned against the stresses of living in relatively large, spatially compact groups [4].

Primate groups are, of course, numerically modest by comparison with the herds formed by some ungulates, but it is this contrast between the rather unstructured, loose herds of, say, wildebeest and the demographically stable, cohesive, highly structured groups of baboons that is the issue here.

In the loose herds that characterize many ungu- lates, relationships between individuals are typically of the moment, and characterized by direct responses to environmental conditions, so that individuals are rela- tively free to join and leave as circumstances dictate

By contrast, anthropoid primate groups (and those of some other mammals such as the elephants and equids) are relatively stable and cohesive, with compo- sitions that remain constant through time, and they are often heavily structured in terms of patterns of dyadic interaction and collective defence [1,2]

Extending HBE to include social species;
Hitherto, our focus has largely been concerned with the fitness-guided behavioural decisions that individuals make (i.e. optimal foraging decisions, mate choice strategies and reproductive scheduling decisions). Here, other individuals are simply part of the context that defines the costs and benefits that have to be evaluated.

In multi-level social systems, however, other individuals are not only part of the context, they are also part of the sol- ution and the individual has to play a more complex game in trading off short- and long-term benefits in order to maximize fitness

Primates have frequently had to break through these constraints in order to allow them to increase social group size when ecological cir- cumstances have demanded this.

2. PRIMATE SOCIALITY AND THE COSTS OF GROUP-LIVING:
- selection pressure driving social group size in primates has been predation risk [5–7]

given that ungulates also group in response to preda- tion without having bonded societies, the reason why primates opted to add a further complication to this process in the formof bonded groups remains unclear, not least because this kind of bondedness ultimately limits the size of social groups that can be held together as a coherent entity.

One possibility is that kinship (which is invariably one of the defining fea- tures of bonded social systems) provides a more powerful basis for mutual defence against external threats, including defence of resources as well as a defence against predation: kin are more likely to take risks to come to each other's aid [8,9].

An alternative (and not necessarily mutually exclusive) possibility is that kin-based micro-coalitions are necessary to defuse the direct costs of living in groups [10]

Since living in groups of any kind creates stresses that would normally result in the group disbanding, species that live in stable social groups have to circumvent this problem if they are to prevent group size collapsing.

GROUP STRESSES:
1. The indirect costs are those generated by time-budgeting issues [11]. 
Tthe more the animals there are in the group, the proportionately bigger area the group has to cover each day to ensure that everyone meets their nutritional requirements, and hence the longer the day journey and the more the time that has to be devoted to travelling. 

2. The direct costs arise from the effect that squabbles and displacements have on the endocrine system, and include not only the physiological drain on the body from heightened cortisol titres but also, in the case of females, destabilized menstrual endocrinology resulting in reduced fertility [4,12–15].

--{\textgreater} Vagus nerve, oxytocin/vasopressin, fight/flight....

Little can be done about the indirect costs, other than reduce group size [However, that would mean the inevitable loss of the benefits derived from grouping (namely, the reduction in predation risk)]

The direct costs, on the other hand, are often more tractable. Primates deal with these by forming coalitions through social grooming that have the effect of buffering the individual against most of the direct stresses of group-living by keeping other members of the group just far enough away that they do not impinge directly on the individual—but without driving them away completely [4].

Primates seem to deal with the direct costs by means of a multi-level form of organization in which low-level coalitions buffer indi- viduals against these costs so as to allow them to maintain cohesive groups

One of these is the fact that creating bonded groups in this way inevitably places constraints on the size of group that can be maintained as a coherent entity. This is not true for unbonded social systems because in this case group size can respond more flexibly to contextual variations in the costs and benefits of grouping (hence allowing very large herds to be sustained, at least temporarily).

This constraint on group size arises in part from the fact that bonded social systems seem naturally to give rise to in-group/ out-group effects (bonded relationships inevitably differentiate between those with whom you have explicit relationships and those with whom you do not)

In addition, bonded social systems are implicit social contracts: to be a member of a bonded group, each individual has to sacrifice some of its immediate selfish interests in order to allow everyone else to share in the benefits provided by the group.

In other words, this is a multi- level selection process that involves balancing the fitness benefits that accrue through pursuing immediate selfish interests against those that accrue through group-level effects generated by cooperation.

The latter are usually delayed, thereby creating a conflict between incompat- ible short- and long-term benefits and the behavioural trajectories that generate them.

However, such societies are inevitably susceptible to freeriders—those who take the benefits provided by the social contract, but do so without paying their share of the costs, in particular those costs related to holding back from exploiting all the short- term benefits that have to be foregone if the contract is to work [19,20]

Once the costs outweigh the benefits for these individuals, they will withdraw from the social contract, and the contract will collapse (usually resulting in group fission)

social bonding seems to operate through a dual process mechanism that involves
1. a psychopharmacological component (mediated by endorphins) and 
2. a cognitive component (whereby relationships of trust and recipro- city are built up) [4].


The psychopharmacological component is derived from social grooming, which is known to trigger b-endorphin activation in the central nervous system [21]. Although endorphins function principally as neurotransmitters, they are explicitly involved in the pain control system and one of their principal functional effects is analgesia [22,23]

This is experienced (in humans, at least) as a mild opiate ‘high', but its effect is probably to relax the animal [24,25] and so allow it to continue interacting with another individual long enough to build a cognitive relationship of trust and obligation.

1. Psychopharmacological mechanism (edorphins):
- There is now an extensive, albeit rather obscure, literature on the social role of endorphins (for reviews, see [26–28])

- Although a great deal has been made of the role of the oxytocin/ vasopression axis in relation to pairbonding and social behaviour [29,30], there is a longstanding view that this mechanism is too fragile and short-lived to be effec- tive in managing long-lasting social bonds such as those associated with primates' uniquely bonded social systems [27,28,31].

Some more robust mechanism is needed over and above the regular mammalian oxytocin mechanism to maintain (or service) relationships of this kind, and the suggestion has been that the endorphin system was co-opted for this purpose [27,28].


All this notwithstanding, maintaining cohesion in social groups depends not just on cognitive functions determined by brain size and the investment in social grooming; it also depends on the moment-to-moment processes of interaction and the fine-tuned signalling that this requires.


Vocal and visual communication repertoires:

Animals need to be able to signal their intentions, and those being signalled need to be able to interpret these signals correctly

It is therefore no surprise to find that both visual (i.e. facial) and vocal signalling capacities correlate with social group size in anthropoid primates.

-- Dobson's [32] index of facial mobility (based on the use of Ekman's [33] facial action coding system (FACS) muscle activity scoring system) is a measure of visual signalling complexity, and it exhibits a clear relationship with social group size across primate species (figure 1a)

-- McComb {\&} Semple [34] demonstrated that primate vocal repertoire size also correlates with social group size across primate species (figure 1b)

Taxa that typically live in larger social groups have larger vocal and visual signal repertoires.

To the extent that larger group size means more complex relationships—and absolutely more dyadic and triadic relationships—this suggests that one solution to the problemof social cohe- sion is to allow more complex interactions to take place, mediated by more complex signalling. 

If so, we might expect signalling complexity to rise to a natural asymptote beyond which it cannot be increased. If group size is to increase beyond the size that corresponds to this limit, then something else has to come into play to breach the glass ceiling.

(while signalling systems certainly do allow animals to adjust to the changing complexity of their social environments, there are hints in these data that tinkering with the signalling system is only good up to a certain point.)

One possibility might be the way primates use coalitionary alliances to buffer themselves against the costs of living in larger groups

This does not, however, mean that they groom with more social partners.

Initially, as group size increases, individuals widen their social network, but after a certain point they contract it again to concentrate their grooming on fewer and fewer social partners, despite the fact that they are actually devoting more time to grooming.

In effect, they appear to be concentrating their available social capital on the core set of individuals who will really matter when the stresses of group living reach critical levels

buffering them against harassment and conflict both with othermembers of their unit and with themembers of neighbouring units ([14,46]; see also [47]). 

Similarly, in baboons, several studies have shown that female social and reproductive success is dependent on the number of core friends they have [48,49].

What this seems to suggest is that, when the stresses start to bite, the animals are anxious to ensure that their core relationships will work when they really need them

This seems to reflect the fact that the intensity, or quality, of the relationship depends on the time invested in it [50], something that we have also documented in humans [51].

In primates at least, coalitions of this kind are established ahead of the circumstances in which they are needed, and this is one of the features that sets primate relationships apart from those of other mammalian taxa [52]

In other words, as group size increases, females seem to withdraw into their enclaves and focus their social attention on their principal allies.

Because terrestrial species live in more predator-risky environments, they have to live in larger groups; but this imposes far greater stresses on them; so they need their alliances to work more effectively to minimize those stresses and allow them to maintain larger groups. 

However, by concen- trating their social effort on a few key allies rather than distributing it around thewider social group, they inevit- ably have rather weak relationships with most of the other individuals in the group and the group is less cohe- sive and so more likely to fragment

In effect, these animals have to manage two tiers of relationship (the grooming-based coalition and the group as a whole) simultaneously

But species living in larger groups have to manage a more complex balance between maintaining the large group size needed for predator protection and investing in the small (but highly effective) coalitions that are needed to allow them to live in such large groups.

In effect, they have two kinds of relationships to manage (strong links with coalition partners and weak links with others) 

FUSION {\&} GROUP IDENTIFICATION! - but there are issues here with how these measures are constructed!

An additional way in which species like baboons
may be able to maintain the coherence of larger groups is to use males as weak links to bridge across between clusters of tightly bonded females [43]

3. THE TRANSITION TO HOMININS: MAINTAINING COHESION IN SUPER-LARGE GROUPS:
Group sizes of around 50 represent the upper limit that can be bonded by the conventional primate mech- anism of social grooming: this is because ecological constraints on the amount of time that can be devoted to social interaction (i.e. grooming) place an upper limit at about 20 per cent of total daytime on grooming time for living primates [40,41]

Because contemporary humans also observe this same time constraint (social time averages almost exactly 20{\%} of waking time across a range of modern populations [61])

Since contemporary hunter–gatherers and chimpanzees operate a fission–fusion form of sociality, it is likely that all—or, at least,most—hominin species also lived in these kinds of societies.

If so, then most of the indirect time-budget stresses would have been less intrusive, but the direct stresses from daily competition would still have had to be moderated by close bonding

fission–fusion social systems probably place an additional cognitive stress on the animals because of the need to be able to remember individuals who are not physically present on the day and factor their interestsintodecisionsonhow to behave [63]

THE PROBLEM WITH GROOMING:
the problem that sets the limit on grooming as a bonding mechanism is the fact that it is a one-on-one activity (and, indeed, still is with us). What might solve the problem is a way of triggering endorphin activation at a distance so that it can be induced in several individuals at the same time.

Cue LAUGHTER:
- First, it is a behaviour that we share with the chimpanzees (and perhaps the other great apes) [60,66,67].

- There are structural differences in the form of laughter that distinguish the human and chimpanzee versions: in humans, laughter involves a series of exhalations, whereas in chimpanzees involves a more complex series of exhalation–inhalation cycles

- the laugh vocalization is used in exactly the same contexts (play) in both taxa [67]. 

- Second, laughter has all the hallmarks of a rela- tively primitive chorusing vocalization: it is intensely social (laughter is 30 times more likely to occur in a social context than when alone) and is highly contagious [66,68].

In effect, it is a form of wordless chorusing

Third, laughter seems to play a particula- rly important role in facilitating social interactions: interactions with close friends in which laughter occurs are perceived as being more satisfying than those where laughter does not occur [69]

Fourth, and most importantly, laughter turns out to be an extremely potent mechanism for triggering endorphin activation (figure 8)

In effect, it functions as a form of grooming-at-a-distance in which the need for physical contact to trigger the endorphin effect has now been replaced by a visual or vocal stimulus.

It is important in this context not to confuse laughter with humour.
We use humour to trigger laughter, but this pre- sumably has only been the case since we evolved the language skills necessary for telling jokes, and language unquestionably evolved much later, perhaps only as recently as 200 kya [59]

Rather, there is a more basic form of laughter that is triggered simply by seeing others laugh (whether or not we understand the joke, and indeed whether or not there even is a joke, be this slapstick or verbal).

It is one thing to laugh, but another to bond, and I suspect that, for it to act as a bonding mechanism, laughter requires face-to-face visual contact, probably at close quarters.

laughter might be deemed to be twice as efficient as grooming as a bond- ing mechanism: it allows the number of interacting individuals to increase from two (the limit on mutual grooming) to four (the limit for conversation groups). In effect, it allows a doubling of the interaction group.

In effect, laughter seemsto have effectively bridged the bonding gap well enough to lift community sizes to around 100 (presumably as a function of the amount of time devoted to laughter and grooming in combination).

To increase community beyond this new threshold, as archaic humans did from around 500 kya, would then have required an additional mechanism allowing an endorphin effect to be createdonanevenlarger scale. Music (including singing and dancing), and after that the rituals of religion, may have successively provided the additional mechanisms [64,65,71].

CONCLUSION:
To break through the glass ceiling imposed by the ecological limit on the time available for groom- ing, humans either had to reduce other time-budget requirements or had to change the behaviour used in bonding. The first was probably not feasible: modelling the time budgets of the australopithecines suggests that they were already operating at the very limits of what was possible [62]},

The correlation method when applied to a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) revealed a significant difference between high and low performers (t[8] = -2.31, p = 0.03) and the directional agreement applied to inter-beat-intervals and RSA revealed trend-level differences (t[4.62] = -1.86, p = 0.06 and t[8] = -1.68, p = 0.07).

abstract = {Research indicates that coactors performing cooperative tasks often exhibit spontaneous and unintended similarities in their physiological and behavioral responses--a phenomenon referred to here as physio-behavioral coupling (PBC). The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra--a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not "unique" to a particular team. Correlation analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of time-series measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC.},

annote = {HR entrainment, in particular, is argued to underlie emotional common ground in social interactions, as it facilitates the construction of a sense of community (Konvalinka et al., 2011), empathy and mindreading (Levenson {\&} Gottman, 1983; Levenson {\&} Ruef, 1992) and even team performance (Elkins et al., 2009; Henning, Boucsein, {\&} Gil, 2001; Henning {\&} Korbelak, 2005; Strang, Funke, Russell, Dukes, {\&} Middendorf, 2014; Wallot, Mitkidis, McGraw, {\&} Roepstorff, submitted).

Interpersonal Synergies Model: interpersonal coordination is functional.
the behavior of interacting agents becomes interdependent (A's behavior impacts B's behavior, which in turn impacts A's behavior) in ways that are shaped by their goals and activities

different tasks call for different ways of interacting and the group performance and experience will be related to how well the interpersonal coordination meets these task affordances.

HR Entrainement 
A central aspect of human social coordination and collaboration concerns the way interacting individuals form group-level behaviors, for instance indexed by co-regulation of their emotional states. Heart rate is a useful measure in this regard as it has been shown to increase with emotional arousal in ways that are emotion-specific (Ekman, Levenson, {\&} Friesen, 1983; Levenson {\&} Ruef, 1992; Schwartz, Weinberger, {\&} Singer, 1981; Sinha, Lovallo, {\&} Parsons, 1992)

Heart rate increases with physical activity (Wallot, Fusaroli, Tyl{\'{e}}n, {\&} Jegind{\o}, 2013) and it is (weakly) entrained to respiration rhythms (Sch{\"{a}}fer, Rosenblum, Kurths, {\&} Abel, 1998; Yasuma {\&} Hayano, 2004). In other words, as interacting agents get to coordinate their behaviors and share emotional ground, we have reasons to expect their HR to become increasingly entrained

Such intuitions have guided investigations of collective high emotional arousal in diverse social contexts:

Di Mascio and colleagues (1955) showed shared co-variation between patient and psycho-therapist, and Levenson and Gottman (1983) observed high levels of physiological entrainment during couple therapy, although mostly in distressed couples during episodes involving negative emotions. Helm and colleagues (2012) found HR entrainment in romantic couples across a series of tasks aimed at eliciting shared emotional arousal.

M{\"{u}}ller and Lindenberger (2011) found similar patterns among choir singers, by specific types of vocal coordination. 

Konvalinka and colleagues (2011) investigated HR entrainment in a high arousal context: a religious fire-walking ritual. Here HR entrainment was even found among participants doing quite different things: Individuals walking on burning coals and spectating family members shared a high level of entrainment, while this was not shared with unrelated spectators

Task-orientated tasks and HR entrainement:
A second line of research focused on more task-oriented collaborative settings, investigating theconnection between HR entrainment and group performance. Henning and colleagues (Henning, Armstead, {\&} Ferris, 2009; Henning et al., 2001) showed that in collaborative maze-game and room-clearing tasks, teams displaying higher HR entrainment solved the task faster and with fewer mistakes

As HR entrainment also correlated with self-reports of team coordination, task engagement, and performance (Gil {\&} Henning, 2000), the researchers argued that it reflected increased team situation awareness, intra-team coordination, and shared mental models. To reinforce this point, Henning and Korbelak (2005) repeated the experiments introducing a disruption: at random times the team roles were re-organized. Immediately before such perturbations, HR entrainment positively predicted post-perturbation performance

However, these results have recently been challenged. Strang and colleagues (2014) report a negative correlation between HR entrainment, team performance and team attributes during a collaborative Tetris- like task. Analogously, Wallot and colleagues (submitted) report HR entrainment to be negatively correlated with self-reports of collaborative satisfaction, and external raters' judgment of output product quality in a joint LEGO construction task. 


Mechanisms behind HR entrainement:
It is clear that hearts (or autonomic systems in general) are not linked in any direct way. Nor are they easily intentionally coordinated

questions regard the mediating factors enabling and facilitating HR entrainment:

1. the co-presence and history of previous interactions
2. the structure of the task that the interacting agents are sharing;
3. degree of behavioral coordination between agents. 

Mimicry and affiliation:
Simply being co-present in a situation has been observed to elicit behavioral and emotional contagion between individuals (Chartrand {\&} Bargh, 1999; Hatfield {\&} Cacioppo, 1994). People spontaneously mimic each other's behaviors and facial expressions, which can lead to the sharing of emotional states, with concomitant shared physiological arousal


sharing the same situation induces shared physiological arousal in a way that is mediated by the history of previous interactions. For instance, being in a social, familiar or romantic relationship facilitates the entrainment of shared HR dynamics (Chatel-Goldman, Congedo, Jutten, {\&} Schwartz, 2014; Helm et al., 2012; Konvalinka et al., 2011; Levenson {\&} Gottman, 1983).

That fact that HR is influenced by activity and respiration might motivate the prediction that the task alone, by constraining participants' behaviors, drives important aspects of the HR entrainment

In short:
Henning and colleagues (Gil {\&} Henning, 2000; Henning et al., 2009; Henning et al., 2001; Henning {\&} Korbelak, 2005) argue that HR entrainment, by reflecting team members' sensorimotor and emotional integration, is indicative of the team's collaborative skills to the point that it can predict future performance.
Other research, however, suggests caution as HR entrainment can also be driven by negative emotions (Levenson {\&} Gottman, 1983), and dysfunctional team coordination and experiences (Strang et al., 2014; Wallot et al., submitted).


Experiment: Lego Serious Play
Groups of participants repeatedly built LEGO models illustrating their understanding of six abstract notions. Sometimes they build the models collaboratively as a group, sometimes as individuals. two different versions of the tasks: Individual constructions afforded high similarity of behaviors without online interaction. Collective constructions afforded less similar behaviors, but encouraged the development of coordinative routines and strategies: group members could not all build or talk at the same time but had to coordinate their actions, negotiate joint understanding and resolve disagreements in order to complete the assignments (Bj{\o}rndahl, Fusaroli, {\O}stergaard, {\&} Tyl{\'{e}}n, 2014, in press).

study 1: we focus on co-presence and task impact on HR entrainment, contrasting individual constructions requiring similar activities and collective constructions requiring actual coordination between group members in terms of complementary speech and building actions. 

we contrasted HR entrainment pairwise between participants co-present at the same table (real pairs) and in pairs artificially constructed by selecting participants from two different groups, thus sharing the task, but not any actual co-presence or interaction (virtual pairs). We designed this setup to investigate three hypotheses. 

Hypothesis 1: Co-presence. If co-presence is crucial in facilitating HR entrainment, we will observe higher HR entrainment in real pairs than in virtual pairs, across individual and collective tasks. 

Hypothesis 2: Task-related constraints. If task-related constraints are the driving force behind HR
entrainment, we will observe no significant difference between HR entrainment in real and virtual pairs across individual and collective tasks. 

Hypothesis 3: Behavioral coordination. If actual interpersonal behavioral coordination is driving HR entrainment, we will observe higher coordination in real pairs during collective, but not individual construction tasks. As behavioral coordination is likely to be established and develop over time, as participants develop turn-taking routines and strategies to co-build models (Bj{\o}rndahl et al., in press; Mills, 2014), we also predict increase in real pairs' HR entrainment over time in collective, but not in individual construction tasks.

Method:
The actual experiment was carried out as a two-condition within-group contrast: collective vs. individual. Each group underwent an interleaved series of six individual and six collective LEGO constructions of five minutes each, during which their heart rate coordination was measured.

In each trial, participants were instructed (in Danish) to use LEGO blocks to construct their understanding of one of six abstract concepts: ‘responsibility' (ansvar), ‘collaboration' (samarbejde), ‘knowledge' (viden), ‘justice' (retf{\ae}rdighed), 'safety' (tryghed) and ‘tolerance' (tolerance). The


Polar Team2 (Polar, 2013) chest-strapped heart rate monitors were used to record participants' heart beat activity as R-R intervals with millisecond accuracy. To align heart beat activity across participants we generated equally sampled time-series by estimating beats per minute every second based on sliding 5-second windows (Wallot et al., 2013). We isolated 5-minute HR sequences corresponding to the 12 construction tasks

HR time series present non-stationary dynamics. In other words, their means and standard deviations may vary over time as a function of e.g. activity, respiration and emotional arousal (Malik et al., 1996; Sayers, 1973). For this reason, linear methods assuming data stationarity, such as for instance correlation, are not appropriate to assess interpersonal HR entrainment

Additionally, interpersonal HR dynamics have been shown to display continuously varying lags of entrainment (Strang et al., 2014), which require a method able to deal with such complexity and not assuming constant lags. We therefore chose to employ Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis, a method developed to quantify the shared dynamics of complex non- linear systems. Relying on two time-series, CRQA reconstructs the phase space of possible combination of states and quantifies the structure of recurrence, that is, of the instances in which the two time-series display similar dynamics, controlling for individual baselines of HR

CRQA has been previously used successfully to assess HR entrainment (Konvalinka et al., 2011; Strang et al., 2014; Wallot et al., 2013) and allowed us to quantify, amongst other things: 

- Level of coordination, defined as the percentage of values that are repeated between the two time series (recurrence rate, RR). The higher the recurrence rate, the more similar the range of values displayed by the participants' HRs.

- Stability of coordination, defined as average length of sequences repeated across time-series (L). The higher the L, the more the participants tend to display prolonged and stable sequences of HR entrainment.
CRQA

we calculated CRQA indexes for all possible pairs of members within each group (within-group real pairs). Per each real pair we then randomly selected a participant and paired her with a participant from a different group, thus generating between-groups virtual pairs. This procedure generated 56 real pairs and 56 virtual ones, measured during each of the 6 collective and 6 individual trials. Since we excluded HR time series in which the sensor lost contact for more than 5 seconds, we ended up with a total of 1306 data points (out of 1344 possible). 2.1.6

comparing the level and stability of HR entrainment according to the experimental manipulations, we employed mixed effects linear models, controlling for group and pair variability, as well as for order of conditions and possible session effects (as participants took a break midways through the experiment)

Each index of HR entrainment (RR and L) was separately employed as dependent variable; activity (individual vs. collective), virtual vs. real, session and order of condition were used as fixed effects, pair and group were used as random effects including random slopes for activity and virtual vs. real. Given the limited amount of degrees of freedom in the data, we only looked at interactions between activity and virtual vs. real. Notice that the random effects structure constrains the degrees of freedom in the same way as a multi-level repeated measures model.

RESULTS: 
The level of HR entrainment displayed a significant main effect of activity with higher overall entrainment during individual (0.081, CI: 0.078, 0.084) than during collective construction tasks (0.071, CI: 0.069, 0.074). In other words, participants' heart rate shared similar variability and dynamics, as expressed by RR, 8{\%} (individual) and 7{\%} (collective) of the time, across all possible time lags. 

However, real vs. virtual pairs did not show any significant difference, nor an interaction with activity. Order was a significant factor, indicating that in general pairs starting with a collective construction tasks would show higher level of HR entrainment

HR entrainment was significantly more stable during individual (4.751, CI: 4.619, 4.905) than during collective construction tasks (4.383, CI: 4.268, 4.498). In other words, pairs during individual trials maintained HR entrainment for longer uninterrupted sequences than pairs during collective trials, with an average difference of ca. 0.4 recurrence points, corresponding to ca. 1.6 seconds.

significantly more structured in real compared to virtual pairs. However, the latter effect was largely driven by an interaction, where real pairs had a significantly more structured HR entrainment than virtual pairs during collective (real: 4.801, CI: 4.678, 4.961; vs. virtual: 3.638, CI: 3.518, 3.765; a difference of ca. 4.8 seconds), but not during individual activity (real: 4.841, CI: 4.639, 5.069; vs. virtual: 4.660, CI: 4.497, 4.857)

Order of condition did not significantly impact the structure of HR entrainment, but session did, as the second session displayed a higher stability of HR entrainment.



study 2: we further investigate the role of behavioral proxies through which HR entrainment can be established and maintained, by attempting to predict HR entrainment based on the levels of building and speech coordination

study 3: we explore the predictive power of physiological entrainment and behavioral coordination for the self- reported experience of the interactions, in particular focusing on group members' experiences of relatedness and group performance},

abstract = {Lately, growing attention in the health sciences has been paid to the dynamics of heart rate as indicator of impending failures and for prognoses. Likewise, in social and cognitive sciences, heart rate is increasingly employed as a measure of arousal, emotional engagement and as a marker of interpersonal coordination. However, there is no consensus about which measurements and analytical tools are most appropriate in mapping the temporal dynamics of heart rate and quite different metrics are reported in the literature. As complexity metrics of heart rate variability depend critically on variability of the data, different choices regarding the kind of measures can have a substantial impact on the results. In this article we compare linear and non-linear statistics on two prominent types of heart beat data, beat-to-beat intervals (R-R interval) and beats-per-min (BPM). As a proof-of-concept, we employ a simple rest-exercise-rest task and show that non-linear statistics-fractal (DFA) and recurrence (RQA) analyses-reveal information about heart beat activity above and beyond the simple level of heart rate. Non-linear statistics unveil sustained post-exercise effects on heart rate dynamics, but their power to do so critically depends on the type data that is employed: While R-R intervals are very susceptible to non-linear analyses, the success of non-linear methods for BPM data critically depends on their construction. Generally, "oversampled" BPM time-series can be recommended as they retain most of the information about non-linear aspects of heart beat dynamics.},

abstract = {The neuromatrix theory of pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic "neurosignature" patterns of nerve impulses generated by a widely distributed neural network-the "body-self neuromatrix"-in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but they may also be generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernable injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The neuromatrix theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output patterns of the body-self neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix.},

abstract = {Pain is a ubiquitous feature of the human experience. This paper presents an anthropology of pain. Anthropology is defined as the cross-cultural and comparative study of human behavior. Pain can be acute and episodic, and pain can be constant and uninterrupted. Acute pain, lasting for minutes or hours, is reported at some time by virtually all adults and by most juveniles and is indicated by the cries and facial expressions of toddlers and infants. This universality of pain as a part of the human condition has been established by the research of many biological, physical, and social scientists. Ethnographers, physicians, and public health experts describe pain complaints for a variety of modern, industrial societies and traditional, undeveloped societies. Pain is the most frequent complaint brought to the offices of physicians in North America, and it is a focus of attention in the literate medical traditions of China, India, and Islamic cultures. Hence, the study of pain and the cultural perceptions of pain are prominent foci of anthropologists. Given that the goal of medicine is to offer medical care to all people who seek it, the practice of modern medicine may be assisted by an exploration of the possibility of cultural differences in medical beliefs and practices in the multiethnic and racially diverse patient populations today.},

abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of implicit attention re-training (AR) on pain ratings, threshold and tolerance during the cold-pressor task and to determine whether the effectiveness of AR was affected by threat expectancy. One hundred and four undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-alleviating or threat-inducing information about the task. Participants were then re-randomized to receive an AR that either trained them to implicitly attend to neutral and ignore pain-related stimuli (neutral training) or to attend towards pain-related stimuli (pain training). Hence, the present study had a 2 (threat expectancy: high vs low) × 2 (AR: pain vs neutral) design. Manipulation checks confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing threat expectancy and the training paradigm shifted attentional biases in predicted directions. Results showed that, relative to neutral re-training, those in the pain re-training group reported higher levels of pain 30 s into the cold pressor task and registered pain more quickly. There was no difference in tolerance between the groups, nor pain at tolerance. This was the same pattern of results found for the threat induction. For initial pain ratings, there was an interaction that closely approached significance (p = 0.053). These results show that AR affects individual's perceptions of and their responses to pain during an experimental task in a similar way to increasing the threat expectancy of the task. Future research should trial AR in real-life settings to determine whether these results can be generalized. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009.},

Children ranging from 4 to 8 years were asked to judge whether five different types of entity exist: real entities (e.g. cats, trees) whose existence is evident to everyone; scientific entities (e.g. germs, oxygen) that are normally invisible but whose existence is generally presupposed in everyday discourse; endorsed beings (e.g. the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus) whose existence is typically endorsed in discourse with young children; equivocal beings (e.g. monsters, witches) whose existence is not typically endorsed in discourse with young children; and impossible entities (e.g. flying pigs, barking cats) that nobody believes in. Children make a broad dichotomy between entities and beings that they claim to exist (real entities; scientific entities; and endorsed beings) and those whose existence they deny (equivocal beings and impossible entities). They also make a more fine-grained distinction among the invisible entities that they claim to exist. Thus, they assert the existence of scientific entities such as germs with more confidence than that of endorsed beings such as Santa Claus. The findings confirm that children's ontological claims extend beyond their first-hand encounters with instances of a given category. Children readily believe in entities that they cannot see for themselves but have been told about. Their confidence in the existence of those entities appears to vary with the pattern of testimony that they receive.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were threefold. Firstly, to investigate the effect of increasing threat-expectancy on attentional biases towards pain-related words. Secondly, to determine the interaction between threat-expectancy and the effectiveness of two coping strategies on pain threshold and tolerance. Thirdly, to investigate the relationship between fear of pain and the experimental manipulations. One hundred undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-increasing or reassuring information about the cold pressor task. After reading the information, all participants completed the dot-probe task for four categories of pain-related words. Following the dot-probe task, participants were randomly allocated to one of two coping strategy conditions (focusing on affective vs sensory aspects of pain). Participants then completed the cold pressor task while engaging in the relevant coping strategy. There was a significant effect of threat on bias towards affective vs sensory pain words. Participants in the threat condition showed a stronger bias towards affective pain words. In contrast, the no-threat condition displayed a stronger bias towards sensory pain words. Significant interaction effects were observed between threat and coping strategy for threshold and tolerance. These results indicated that focusing on sensory pain sensations was helpful in the absence of threat, however, in the presence of threat was relatively unhelpful in comparison to focusing on the affective components of pain. The present results provide support for the fear-avoidance model of pain [Vlaeyen JWS, Linton SJ. Fear-avoidance and its consequences in chronic musculoskeletal pain: a state of the art.

annote = {collectively shared representations of the world – the “group mind.”

Membership in an arbitrary group was sufficient to increase 341 preferences for in-group members in terms of evaluation (Van Bavel and 342 Cunningham 2009a), memory (Van Bavel and Cunningham 2012; Van Bavel 343 et al. 2012a) and neural activity in the amygdala (Van Bavel et al. 2008) and FFA 344 (Van Bavel et al. 2011). Thus, while visually salient categories like race trigger rapid bottom-up processing due to low-level visual input (e.g., physiognomic 346 features) and stereotypic associations within the first few hundred milliseconds of 347 perceptual processing (Ito and Urland 2003), this does not mean they are automatic 348 or inevitable







"Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not acciden- tally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something that precedes the the individual." – Aristotle, Politics

Minimal Groups:
form groups quickly and flexibly and favor in-group members even under rather arbitrary premises, all of which points to the value humans place on social identity 29 and the context-dependent process of identification (Tajfel et al. 1971)

Self-categorization theory explains the emergence of group-level psychological
31 processes in terms of the functioning of the self-concept (Turner et al. 1994)

activation of psychological connections between the self and some class of stimuli at the personal (i.e., defining oneself as unique from others) or the collective (i.e., defining oneself in terms of similar characteristics to one's social group) level (Turner et al. 1987)

Further, self-categorization is “inher- 36 ently variable, fluid, and context dependent” (Turner et al. 1994)

According to this perspective, reality is always perceived and interpreted through the lens of one's current and socially defined self, which makes all cognition necessarily social (Turner et al. 1994).

social identities structure a wide range of human 46 cognitive processes, from rapid evaluation and face memory to mental state attri- 47 bution and representations of physical distance.

dual process and systems models 
have emerged as the 66 dominant paradigm for understanding human cognition, especially social cognition:

System 1 is reflexive, automatic, fast, affective, and 68 associative, and System 2 is deliberative, controlled, slow, cognitive, and propositional (e.g., Chaiken and Trope 1999; Kahneman 2003)

assume that people initially perceive targets in terms of their membership in a social category (e.g., age, gender, race), relying 72 on stereotypes about the category to inform their evaluations and judgments

with the motivation and opportunity to suppress their initial, biased impulses can individuate people to avoid applying stereotypes (Brewer 75 1988; e.g., Devine 1989; Fazio et al. 1995; Fiske and Neuberg 1990; Greenwald 76 and Banaji 1995)

advances in neuroscience suggest that the human evaluative system is more widely distributed 79 and dynamic than initially assumed by many dual process models (see Cunningham 80 et al. 2007; Freeman and Ambady 2011; Van Bavel et al. 2012b)

nstead of construing automatic and controlled processes as dichotomous or independent stages of the perceptual and evaluative processing stream, we argue that dynamic
aspects of self-categorization – such as identifying with an arbitrary group – can shape ostensibly automatic aspects of cognition (Van Bavel and Cunningham 85 2011).

Different social identities change how people rapidly and reflexively con- 86 strue and evaluate stimuli in their environment.

Minimal Group Identities Override Racial Biases:
In a pair of initial experiments, we examined the influence of a shared social
identity on ostensibly automatic evaluations (Van Bavel and Cunningham 2009a) and amygdala activity (Van Bavel et al. 2008)

Method:
We presented faces of in-group and out-group members for 150 milliseconds in a response-window priming task and examined the effects of these faces on valence judgments of positive and negative 112 words (Cunningham et al. 2001; Draine and Greenwald 1998)

assess very rapid evaluations to faces on the basis of their group membership and 114 race (as well as the interaction between these social categories)

As predicted, 115 participants who were assigned to a mixed-race group had positive evaluations of 116 in-group members, regardless of the group members' race.

Specifically, we foundthat group membership increased positivity toward Black in-group members relative to Black out-group members, eliminating the standard pattern of automatic 119 racial bias when evaluating in-group members (Fazio et al. 1995)

Thus, participants' evaluations reflected their current self-categorization with a minimal group, 121 even when the in-group and out-group had no history of contact or conflict and 122 when there was an orthogonal, visually salient social category (i.e., race) with 123 strong stereotypic and evaluative associations

we reasoned that these minimal social identities might also override the racial biases in neural activity observed in previous research (see 126 Amodio and Lieberman 2009; Cunningham and Van Bavel 2009; Kubota 127 et al. 2012 for reviews)

Individual differences in amygdala activity in response to viewing 134 Black compared to White faces are correlated with implicit measures of racial bias 135 (Amodio et al. 2003; Cunningham et al. 2004; Phelps et al. 2000)

we reasoned that amygdala activity would be greater for in-group 144 members in a minimal group context, since in-group members help fulfill a number 145 of important motives (e.g., economic, psychological, and evolutionary), regardless 146 of race

As predicted, participants had greater amygdala activity to in-group members than out-group members, regardless of their race (see also Chiao et al. 2008). In-group biases in neural activity were not moderated by target race or categorization task (i.e.,categorizing by team or by race)

Importantly, in-group biases in amygdala 157 activity occurred within minutes of team assignment, in the absence of explicit group-based rewards or punishments, and independent of pre-existing attitudes, stereotypes, or extensive exposure to the groups

Social Identity and Person Memory

According to the ORB, people are better at remembering those from 167 their own race than those from other races because they have more extensive 168 perceptual expertise with own-race faces (Malpass and Kravitz 1969)

Consistent with this perceptual exper- 174 tise account, pervious functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research 175 (Golby et al. 2001; see also Lieberman et al. 2005) reported a correlation between 176 individual differences in the magnitude of ORB and activity in the fusiform face 178 area (FFA), a sub-region of the fusiform gyrus located on the ventral surfaces of the 179 temporal lobe and implicated in face perception (Kanwisher et al. 1997; Sergent 180 et al. 1992) and visual expertise (see Palmeri and Gauthier 2004 for a review)

As 189 predicted, we found greater activation within the bi-lateral fusiform gyri for 190 in-group relative to out-group faces (Van Bavel et al. 2008). We replicated this 191 pattern of in-group bias in the FFA (using a functionally localized sub-region of the 192 fusiform gyri that is sensitive to faces) and found that relatively greater activity in 193 the FFA mediates the effects of group membership on recognition memory, a 194 behavioral index of individuation (Van Bavel et al. 2011)

These results provide evidence that the FFA is sensitive to shifts in self-
204 categorization, responding selectively to face stimuli imbued with psychological 205 significance by virtue of their currently salient group membership and encoding the 206 more motivationally relevant in-group faces at the subordinate level

Participants show greater activation in (a) fusiform gyri and (b) amygdala when viewing novel in-group members, regardless of race (Adapted from Van Bavel et al. 2008)


In follow-up research, we found that superior memory for in-group compared to out-group members was only evident among participants who were highly identified with the in-group (Van 210 Bavel and Cunningham 2012) or had a high need to belong (Van Bavel 211 et al. 2012a)

Further, enhanced memory for in-group members was mediated by 212 enhanced attention to in-group members during the learning phase and could be 213 reduced by assigning participants to a role (i.e., spy) that motivated their attention 214 to out-group members (Van Bavel and Cunningham 2012)

Further, enhanced memory for in-group members was mediated by enhanced attention to in-group members during the learning phase and could be 213 reduced by assigning participants to a role (i.e., spy) that motivated their attention 214 to out-group members (Van Bavel and Cunningham 2012)

Thus, our research 215 provides evidence that group membership can shape the motivational relevance 216 of categories in a flexible and dynamic fashion even in the absence of long-term 217 experience with the category

Social Identity Alters the Threshold for Mind Perception:
mind perception – is a reflexive and ubiquitous feature of human social cognition and influences the extent to which people see others as worthy of moral consideration (Gray et al. 2007)

Recent work has suggested that people perceive minds behind faces using bottom-up, visual features. Looser and 223 Wheatley (2010) asked participants to view faces along a spectrum of morphs 224 between human faces and inanimate faces (e.g., dolls) and to indicate whether
each had a mind (i.e., people 228 only perceive minds with a high degree of humanness in the face)

the brain differentiates between human and 230 inanimate faces within a few hundred milliseconds of seeing a face (Wheatley 231 et al. 2011)

We tested whether group membership could provide a top-down cue shaping the 236 motivational relevance of minds behind faces.

We reasoned that in-group members may be seen as more relevant targets for fulfilling social needs (Brewer 1988), which have been connected in past research to anthropomorphism and higher-level attribution of mind to others (Epley et al. 2007). 

However, in the case of threatening 240 out-groups, it may be advantageous to consider the out-group's mental states and 241 plans rather than to deny them a mind. We therefore hypothesized that collective identification with a group would ordinarily lead people to infer minds more readily for in-group faces but that out-group threat might enhance mind perception toward out-group faces.

Even in minimal groups, participants had more lenient thresholds for perceiving minds in in-group faces

In further work using real-world groups based on university affiliation, we found that these effects were moderated by individual differences in collective identification, i.e., the extent to which people define themselves by and feel invested in the group (Leach 259 et al. 2008). 

greater identification with one's group was associated with greater in-group bias in mind perception

we found that perceived out-group threat reversed this effect: Democrats and Republicans, two highly competitive political groups, who saw the other group as a threat to their own had more lenient thresholds for out-group mind perception

These experiments suggest that inferring a mind behind a face depends not only
on bottom-up visual cues to humanness but also on top-down identity motives

functionally relevant motivations such as in-group identification and out-group threat can shape mind perception in opposing directions


we tested whether group membership would differentially impact two dimensions of mind perception: agency, which refers to abilities such as thinking and planning, and experience, which refers to abilities such as feeling pleasure, pain, or emotion.

hypothesized that people might be more ready to perceive experience in in-group members while still seeing 273 agency in out-group members, especially for threatening groups

we found that group membership impacted activation in the brain's theory of mind network when participants judged experience, but not agency, in faces (Hackel 276 et al. unpublished manuscript)


Social Identity Shapes Distance Perception 
We have also been exploring whether self-categorization with social groups may even shape basic representations of physical reality

Recent research has demonstrated the influence of motivational factors,
including identity-related motives, on perception and representation of physical aspects of stimuli, such as spatial distance (Burris and Branscombe 2005; Proffitt 286 2006). In a similar vein, we have shown that social identity, identity threat, and 287 degree of collective identification can shape the perception of physical distance 288 (Xiao and Van Bavel 2012)

locations signifying a threatening (vs. non-threatening) out-group 290 were perceived as physically closer, particularly among those who strongly identify with their threatened in-group (Xiao and Van Bavel 2012) 

We tested this effect with various types of social identities, including professional sports team fandom, nationality, and university affiliation

Yankees fans, compared to those not identified with the Yankees, estimated Fenway Park – the stadium of their rival Red Sox – to be physically closer

Highly identified Americans who 296 perceived Mexican immigration to be a threat to America estimated Mexico City to be particularly closer compared to those who did not highly identify with America or did not perceive Mexican immigration to be a threat (see Fig. 4)

When we experimentally manipulated threat, highly identified New York University affiliates
estimated Columbia University to be closer when Columbia was portrayed as a threat compared to when it was portrayed as of similar status (Xiao and Van Bavel 302 2012).

However, when we experimentally manipulated the 312 security of the national border, this relationship was eliminated, suggesting that a 313 strong intergroup barrier served as a psychological buffer against intergroup threat

(Xiao and Van Bavel 2013). Further, manipulating the perceived closeness of a 315 threatening out-group elicits discrimination towards members of this out-group 316 (Xiao and Van Bavel 2013)

In sum, this research suggests that various aspects of 317 social identity and the intergroup context dynamically influence perceptual representations of physical reality and these representations may have important influences on real-world behavior.

Discussion:
Even rapidly and arbitrarily created social groups, which people have 325 no prior knowledge about or contact with, can override the influences from existing 326 social categories that often carry a great deal of societal and historical baggage, 327 such as racial groups in America

The primary theoretical implication of our work is 328 that social identities can have a profound impact on group members' representa- 329 tions of the social world (Hastorf and Cantril 1954)

Our research suggests the influence of social identity is far more pervasive and may even penetrate some of the most automatic and basic cognitive processes (Van Bavel 336 and Cunningham 2011)

very brief exposure to arbitrary intergroup alliances was sufficient to elicit identification with an arbitrary group and make this a more potent social category than race

Thus, while visually salient categories like race trigger rapid bottom-up processing due to low-level visual input (e.g., physiognomic 346 features) and stereotypic associations within the first few hundred milliseconds of 347 perceptual processing (Ito and Urland 2003), this does not mean they are automatic or inevitable. As we discuss above, a psychologically salient social identity can 349 exert a top-down influence on these processes and attenuate ostensibly automatic racial biases

introduce the possibility that transient aspects of self-categorization can override visually salient and socially important categories – 352 including those with which people have extensive experiencperhaps before these 353 social categories even begin to influence the perceptual and evaluative system (see 354 also Cunningham et al. 2012)

patterns of activation within the fusiform encode race even when mean activation is driven by other motivationally relevant group memberships. There- 370 fore, the human visual system may still encode skin color and physiognomic 371 features that allow them to distinguish between Black and White faces, even 372 when other more motivationally salient social categorizations override racial bias 373 on specific outcomes.

cognition and emotion need not emerge only after unavoidable automatic responses, controlling these responses through strategies like suppression or reappraisal. Rather, Top-down influences on top-down influences may be able to change which responses become active in the first place through a form of pre-appraisal, thus influencing 389 cognitive, evaluative, and affective outcomes.


Conclusion:
“The Group Mind” (1921), William McDougall noted that 400 psychology in the nineteenth century had studied the human mind without consid- 401 eration of the social context. In contrast, he argued that individual psychology could 402 not be understood in the absence of collective social process and that groups have a 403 collective mental life that is not merely the sum of the mental lives of individuals. 404

how social groups structure individual cognition across 405 several levels of analysis, providing a cognitive and neural basis for a “group 406 mind.” In this way, social identities provide a set of expectations and goals that 407 can elicit a common perceptual and evaluative framework across multiple group 408 members, leading to shared representations and a framework for collective action. 409},

abstract = {As L. Festinger (1957) argued, the social group is a source of cognitive dissonance as well as a vehicle for reducing it. That is, disagreement from others in a group generates dissonance, and subsequent movement toward group consensus reduces this negative tension. The authors conducted 3 studies to demonstrate group-induced dissonance. In the first, students in a group with others who ostensibly disagreed with them experienced greater dissonance discomfort than those in a group with others who agreed. Study 2 demonstrated that standard moderators of dissonance in past research--lack of choice and opportunity to self-affirm, similarly reduced dissonance discomfort generated by group disagreement. In Study 3, the dissonance induced by group disagreement was reduced through a variety of interpersonal strategies to achieve consensus, including persuading others, changing one's own position, and joining an attitudinally congenial group.},
annote = {disagreement from others in a group generates dissonance, and subsequent movement toward group consensus reduces this negative tension

Stone and Cooper's (2001, 2003) self- standards model, dissonance occurs when people evaluate their behavior and find it discrepant from some standard of judgment

This standard can be based on personal considerations and self-expectancies or on social factors such as the normative rules and prescriptions used by most people in a culture (SUBJECTIVE/OBJECTIVE markers of group, status, etc?)

vicarious dissonance also recognizes social sources of dissonance in the idea that one person's discrepant behavior can generate vicarious discomfort in observers and spur attitude change to resolve the socially shared dissonance (Norton, Monin, Cooper, {\&} Hogg, 2003; Sakai, 1999).

dissonance can be resolved through group-level mechanisms, including 

- the diffusion of responsibility for a dissonance-producing act to others in a group and 
- the misattribution of dissonance arousal to dislike for an out-group (Cooper{\&}Mackie, 1983; Zanna{\&}Sande, 1987)


Dissonance

According to Festinger (1957), dissonance is a psychological discomfort or an aversive drive state that people are motivated to reduce, just as they are motivated to reduce hunger. 

Heider (1946, 1958) also conceived of unbalanced states as yielding tension, but he saw the shift toward balance as a cool, almost nonmotivational process based on the Gestalt idea that people's perceptions tend toward simple cognitive structures or “good figures.”

Festinger's original dissonance theory did not specify the origins of cognitive inconsistency beyond the general notion that inconsistency arises when one cognitive element does not follow from another, as occurs when others in a group disagree

Balance theory also is congenial to the idea that simple heterogeneity of group members' views is sufficient to generate an unbalanced state

In one view, people are motivated to maintain harmony in judgments with others and to reduce attitude discrepancies because others value and reward consistency with external social norms and they devalue and punish inconsistency (Hovland {\&} Rosenberg, 1960). 

Others might also prefer consistency because consistent behavior is predictable (Newcomb, 1953)

enhanced confidence in the validity of one's own attitudes that arises when others agree instead of disagree (Newcomb, 1953).

attitudinal heterogeneity is motivating because it is associated with social sanctions and because it threatens judgment validity

(a) the normative reasons reflected in one's own and others' expectations and (b) the informational reasons represented in evidence about reality (e.g., Deutsch{\&}Gerard, 1955; Festinger, 1950; Jones {\&} Gerard, 1967; Kelley, 1952)

NORMATIVE
motives to achieve a coherent, favorable self-concept as well as to establish positive relations with others (Chaiken, Giner-Sorolla, {\&} Chen, 1996; Cialdini {\&} Trost, 1998; Wood, 2000)

INFORMATIONAL
people's desire to have a valid understanding of reality and thereby to effectively negotiate their world

To meet informational needs, people rely on others' views in part because social consen- sus is not normally opposed to reality and in part because similar others have the power to define reality (Tajfel, 1978; Tajfel {\&} Turner, 1986)

dis- agreement from relevant others can threaten self-esteem (Pool, Wood, {\&} Leck, 1998; Tajfel, 1978) and social acceptance (Schachter, 1951) and can yield subjective uncertainty (Hardin {\&} Higgins, 1996; Haslam et al., 1996).

Regardless of whether dissonance is produced directly from others' disagreement or is an indirect product of the normative and informational chal- lenges posed by disagreement, there is good theoretical reason to believe that dissonance arises from interpersonal inconsistencies in judgments

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

Balance Theory:
Especially when the dyadic relations are high in intensity and involve close friends or strong attitudes, dyads with unbalanced relations (i.e., liked/related people disagree or disliked/unrelated people agree) are typically judged to be less pleasant and less stable than ones with balanced relations

Alexander (1964) examined the drinking behavior of male adolescents in friendship groups. As predicted, groups that were balanced so that everyone was a drinker or an abstainer were judged by nongroup members to be more attractive and popular than heterogeneous groups that included some drinkers and some abstainers

Alexander invoked the balance notion that “an uncomfortable psychological condition, ‘strain' (tension, stress, etc.), results from perceived disparity between one's own attitude and an attitude attributed to an attractive other with respect to an important object of perceived common relevance” (p. 395)

More direct evidence of heightened arousal in interactions with others who hold opposing positions was provided in Taylor's (1968) study of two-person discussion groups.
As the interaction progressed, unbalanced dyads dis- played more tension-reducing behaviors such as laughing and joking

Study 1
measured directly whether attitude heterogeneity in groups is experienced as dissonance

group members were presented with others' (supposed) attitudes on a contro- versial social or campus issue and then reported their emotions on a self-report measure of dissonance (Elliot {\&} Devine, 1994)


What is the nature of dissonance?
people reported feelings of discomfort, unease, and bother

we anticipated that participants in a group with others who disagree would report more psychological discomfort than those in a group with others who agree

It seems that people flexibly interpret the arousal generated by cognitive inconsistencies so that dissonance arousal is sometimes experienced narrowly as discom- fort and other times more broadly as a general negative state (see Cooper {\&} Fazio, 1984).

Thus, some research using the standard counterattitudinal advocacy dissonance paradigm has found increased discomfort alone (e.g., Elliot {\&} Devine, 1994; Galinsky et al., 2000), whereas other research has found heightened general negative affect in addition to discomfort (e.g., Harmon-Jones, 1999, Study 1)

threats to self-integrity and self-esteem plausibly yield negative self-feelings along with discomfort (e.g., Aronson, 1999; Stone{\&}Cooper, 2001, 2003)

The first study also investigated whether the amount of dissonance discomfort increased with the pressure to agree with others.

To manipulate pressure, 
some participants were told that they would discuss an attitude issue with other group members, 
other participants that they would discuss the issue to reach consensus and 
still others that they would not interact with their group but just be exposed to group opinions

RESULTS:

Success of Manipulations
Group Attitudes (others agree vs. disagree) X Group Type (discussion vs. consensus) analysis of variance (ANOVA) design

- participants reported being more motivated to achieve consensus when instructed to do so in the consensus condition than when this instruction was not given in the discussion condition

Emotional Reactions 
Mean emotional reactions were analyzed according to a Group Attitudes (others agree vs. disagree)?Group Type (discussion vs. consensus vs. no-interaction) ? Emotion (dissonance discomfort vs. negative self-evaluation vs. positive feelings) ANOVA. 

The analysis revealed a main effect for type of emotion, F(2, 362) ? 347.05, p?.01, and a marginal effect for group attitude, F(1, 181)?3.03, p ? .09.

Importantly, the predicted two-way interaction emerged between group attitudes and emotion, F(2, 362) ? 7.58, p ? .01. In addition, the interaction between group type and emotion was significant, F(4, 362)?4.59, p?.01.

As anticipated, participants in the disagreement condition experienced significantly more dissonance discomfort than those in the agreement condition, F(1, 187) ? 13.49, p ? .01. No differences emerged on negative self-evaluations or positive feelings (both Fs ? 1).

the impending interaction generated a negative mood state regardless of whether the group agreed or disagreed.

the discussion and con- sensus conditions reported greater discomfort and less positive emotions than the no-interaction condition (ps ? .06)

discomfort ratings in Table 1 suggests that, with greater amounts of group pressure, disagreement gener- ated greater discomfort than agreement

Participants in the discussion and consensus conditions experienced significantly more discom- fort when others disagreed, which suggested that dissonance creased with increasing group pressure, F(1, 183)?4.91, p?.05, and F(1, 183) ? 9.97, p ? .01, for discussion and consensus, respectively. However those in the control condition did not ex- perience more discomfort when others disagreed versus agreed (F ? 1.3)

The most popular strategy, used by 28{\%} of partici- pants overall, was to bolster their own positions by citing reasons why they were correct. Furthermore, bolstering varied across group agreement, with 38{\%} of participants experiencing disagree- ment engaged in bolstering, whereas only 18{\%} of those experi- encing agreement engaged in bolstering,

STUDY 1 DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated that being grouped with others who hold opinions opposed to one's own induces feelings of dissonance discomfort. The greater discomfort when others disagreed than agreed emerged as a main effect across the levels of group pres- sure. That is, discomfort was heightened by disagreement when participants expected to interact with their group, when they ex- pected to interact until they reached a consensus, and, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent, when they were simply informed of other group members' divergent views and did not expect to interact with them.

Instead, heightened discomfort reflected the more specific experience of being uncomfortable and tense

STUDY 2:
disagreement from others in a free choice paradigm apparently introduced new elements that were dissonant with participants' already existing cognitions

discomfort was reduced by standard moderators of dissonance that we adapted from past counterattitudinal advo- cacy research (see Harmon-Jones {\&} Mills, 1999; Olson {\&} Stone, in press)

participants in the present study experienced little dissonance discomfort when they were given low choice about taking an opposing position in the group or when they freely disagreed and then were encouraged to self-affirm important self-attributes

In summary, the first two studies provide support for our
group-y perspective on dissonance. They indicate that dissonance arises from inconsistencies grounded in interpersonal interaction, much as past research with individual-level paradigms has dem- onstrated that dissonance arises from intrapersonal inconsistencies, especially from individual's counterattitudinal behavior.

inconsistency is a motivator in its own right. This view can be contrasted with the alternative idea that disagreement generates discomfort because it presents an informa- tional challenge by threatening the validity of people's attitudes or a social challenge by threatening social acceptance from the group and the shared social identity (e.g., Hovland {\&} Rosenberg, 1960; Newcomb, 1953).

abstract = {Intermittent, chronically delivered electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) is an FDA-approved procedure for the treatment of refractory complex/partial epilepsy in humans. Stimulation of the vagus has also been shown to enhance memory storage processes in laboratory rats and human subjects. Recent evidence suggests that some of these effects of VNS may be due to the activation of neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus resulting in the release of norepinephrine (NE) throughout the neuraxis. Because antagonism of NE systems has been shown to delay recovery of function following brain damage, it is possible that enhanced release of NE in the CNS may facilitate recovery of function. To evaluate this hypothesis the lateral fluid percussion injury (LFP) model of traumatic brain injury was used and a variety of motor and cognitive behavioral tests were employed to assess recovery in pre-trained stimulated, control, and sham-injured laboratory rats. Two hours following moderate LFP, vagus nerve stimulation (30.0-sec trains of 0.5 mA, 20.0 Hz, biphasic pulses) was initiated. Stimulation continued in each animal's home cage at 30-min intervals for a period of 14 days, with the exception of brief periods when the animals were disconnected for behavioral assessments. Motor behaviors were evaluated every other day following LFP and tests included beam walk, locomotor placing, and skilled forelimb reaching. In each measure an enhanced rate of recovery and /or level of final performance was observed in the VNS-LFP animals compared to nonstimulated LFP controls. Behavior in the Morris water maze was assessed on days 11-14 following injury. Stimulated LFP animals showed significantly shorter latencies to find the hidden platform than did controls. Despite these behavioral effects, neurohistological examination did not reveal significant differences in lesion extent, density of fluorojade positive neurons, reactive astrocytes or numbers of spared neurons in the CA3 subarea of the hippocampus, at least at the one time point studied 15 days post-injury. These results support the idea that vagus nerve stimulation enhances the neural plasticity that underlies recovery of function following brain damage and provides indirect support for the hypothesis that enhanced NE release may mediate the effect. Importantly, since VNS facilitated both the rate of recovery and the extent of motor and cognitive recovery, these findings suggest that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve may prove to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for traumatic brain injury.},

abstract = {Among its many roles in body and brain, oxytocin influences social behavior. Understanding the precise nature of this influence is crucial, both within the broader theoretical context of neurobiology, social neuroscience and brain evolution, but also within a clinical context of disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and autism. Research exploring oxytocin's role in human social behavior is difficult owing to its release in both body and brain and its interactive effects with other hormones and neuromodulators. Additional difficulties are due to the intricacies of the blood-brain barrier and oxytocin's instability, which creates measurement issues. Questions concerning how to interpret behavioral results of human experiments manipulating oxytocin are thus made all the more pressing. The current paper discusses several such questions. We highlight unresolved fundamental issues about what exactly happens when oxytocin is administered intranasally, whether such oxytocin does in fact reach appropriate receptors in brain, and whether central or peripheral influences account for the observed behavioral effects. We also highlight the deeper conceptual issue of whether the human data should be narrowly interpreted as implicating a specific role for oxytocin in complex social cognition, such a generosity, trust, or mentalizing, or more broadly interpreted as implicating a lower-level general effect on general states and dispositions, such as anxiety and social motivation. Using several influential studies, we show how seemingly specific, higher-level social-cognitive effects can emerge via a process by which oxytocin's broad influence is channeled into a specific social behavior in a context of an appropriate social and research setting.

abstract = {Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an antiepileptic treatment, which has recently shown promise as an antidepressant. Yet, its antidepressant mechanisms of action are unknown. Serotonergic [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin)] and noradrenergic [norepinephrine (NE)] systems are involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. The present study analyzes 5-HT and NE neuronal firing rates in their brainstem nuclei: the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and locus coeruleus (LC), respectively. The basal firing rates in the DRN and LC were significantly increased after long-term treatments with VNS. After short-term VNS treatments, firing rates were significantly higher for LC (at 1 h and 3 days). As changes in their firing rate may have been due to altered autoreceptor sensitivities, the responses of autoreceptors to the acute administration of their respective agonists were assessed. However, no significant difference was seen in the DRN. No significant differences in dose response curves for 5-HT(1A) somatodendritic and alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptors were noticed between long-term VNS and controls. VNS appears to have a novel mechanism of antidepressant action, enabling its effectiveness in treatment-resistant depression. LC firing rates significantly increase earlier than the DRN basal firing. As the LC has an excitatory influence on DRN, it is possible that the increased DRN firing rate is secondary to an initial increased LC firing rate from VNS.},

These co-occurring traits are viewed as an adaptive complex that offers clues to the evolution of religion from its nonhuman ritual roots. We consider the critical element differentiating religious from non- human ritual to be the conditioned association of emotion and abstract symbols. We propose neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such associations and argue that the brain plasticity of human adolescence constitutes an experience expectant developmental period for ritual conditioning of sacred symbols. We suggest that such symbols evolved to solve an ecological problem by extending communication and coordination of social relations across time and space.},

abstract = {Abstract: This article presents theory and research on the scientific study of emotion that emphasizes the importance of coherence as an optimal psychophysiological state. A dynamic systems view of the interrelations between psychological, cognitive and emotional systems and neural communication networks in the human organism provides a foundation for the view presented. These communication networks are examined from an information processing perspective and reveal a fundamental order in heart-brain interactions and a harmonious synchronization of physiological systems associated with positive emotions. The concept of coherence is drawn on to understand optimal functioning which is naturally reflected in the heart's rhythmic patterns. Research is presented identifying various psychophysiological states linked to these patterns, with neurocardiological coherence emerging as having significant impacts on well being. These include psychophysiological as well as improved cognitive performance. From this, the central role of the heart is explored in terms of biochemical, biophysical and energetic interactions. Appendices provide further details and research on; psychophysiological functioning, reference previous research in this area, details on research linking coherence with optimal cognitive performance, heart brain synchronization and the energetic signature of the various psychophysiological modes.},

abstract = {Neural correlates have been described for emotions evoked by states of homeostatic imbalance (e.g. thirst, hunger, and breathlessness) and for emotions induced by external sensory stimulation (such as fear and disgust). However, the neurobiological mechanisms of their interaction, when they are experienced simultaneously, are still unknown. We investigated the interaction on the neurobiological and the perceptional level using subjective ratings, serum parameters, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a situation of emotional rivalry, when both a homeostatic and a sensory-evoked emotion were experienced at the same time. Twenty highly dehydrated male subjects rated a disgusting odor as significantly less repulsive when they were thirsty. On the neurobiological level, we found that this reduction in subjective disgust during thirst was accompanied by a significantly reduced neural activity in the insular cortex, a brain area known to be considerably involved in processing of disgust. Furthermore, during the experience of disgust in the satiated condition, we observed a significant functional connectivity between brain areas responding to the disgusting odor, which was absent during the stimulation in the thirsty condition. These results suggest interference of conflicting emotions: an acute homeostatic imbalance can attenuate the experience of another emotion evoked by the sensory perception of a potentially harmful external agent. This finding offers novel insights with regard to the behavioral relevance of biologically different types of emotions, indicating that some types of emotions are more imperative for behavior than others. As a general principle, this modulatory effect during the conflict of homeostatic and sensory-evoked emotions may function to safeguard survival. •Investigation of simultaneous experience of homeostatic and sensory-evoked emotions•Subjective ratings and neurophysiological measures of the interaction were studied.•When thirsty, healthy subjects rated a fermented fish odor as less disgusting.•Disgust-related brain activity in the insular cortex was reduced by thirst.•Homeostatic imbalance modulates sensory perception both subjectively and neurophysiologically.},

abstract = {Past research indicates that self-control relies on some sort of limited energy source. This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.},

These responses are believed to be mediated, at least in part, by noradrenergic projections from the medulla oblongata, and some of these noradrenergic neurones also contain prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP). Central administration of either PrRP or noradrenaline stimulates oxytocin secretion into the circulation. Stressful stimuli activate PrRP-containing noradrenergic neurones in the medulla oblongata, and it is thus possible that PrRP/noradrenergic projections to the hypothalamus mediate oxytocin responses to stressful stimuli. Here, the roles of brainstem PrRP/noradrenergic projections to the hypothalamus in oxytocin responses to different kinds of stressful stimuli are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on conditioned fear. Roles of dendritic oxytocin release during stress and metabolic factors affecting stress pathways are also discussed.},

abstract = {Ritualized behavior, intuitively recognizable by its stereotypy, rigidity, repetition, and apparent lack of rational motivation, is found in a variety of life conditions, customs, and everyday practices: in cultural rituals, whether religious or non-religious; in many children's complicated routines; in the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD); in normal adults around certain stages of the life-cycle, birthing in particular. Combining evidence from evolutionary anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging, we propose an explanation of ritualized behavior in terms of an evolved Precaution System geared to the detection of and reaction to inferred threats to fitness. This system, distinct from fear-systems geared to respond to manifest danger, includes a repertoire of clues for potential danger as well as a repertoire of species-typical precautions. In OCD pathology, this system does not supply a negative feedback to the appraisal of potential threats, resulting in doubts about the proper performance of precautions, and repetition of action. Also, anxiety levels focus the attention on low-level gestural units of behavior rather than on the goal-related higher-level units normally used in parsing the action-flow. Normally automatized actions are submitted to cognitive control. This "swamps" working memory, an effect of which is a temporary relief from intrusions but also their long-term strengthening. Normal activation of this Precaution System explains intrusions and ritual behaviors in normal adults. Gradual calibration of the system occurs through childhood rituals. Cultural mimicry of this system's normal input makes cultural rituals attention-grabbing and compelling. A number of empirical predictions follow from this synthetic model.},

She found that subordinates were more accurate at judging how their bosses viewed them than bosses were at judging how their subordinates viewed them, but that bosses were more accurate at judging how subordinates viewed themselves than subordinates were at judging how bosses viewed themselves. We believe, however, that these results were obscured by stereotype accuracy. Using previously collected data, we found that stereotype accuracy does lead to the pattern previously observed by Snodgrass. We also discovered that when we controlled for stereotype accuracy, subordinates' perceptions were generally more accurate than those of their bosses, which supports Snodgrass's original hypothesis.},

abstract = {Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is known to improve cognitive processing, presumably by affecting activity in central nervous system structures that process recently acquired information. It has long been assumed that these effects are related to stimulation-induced increases of norepinephrine (NE) release in limbic brain structures. The present study examined this hypothesis by administering VNS at an intensity and duration that improves memory and then measuring fluctuations in NE output in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) with in vivo microdialysis. In Experiment 1, VNS caused a 98{\%} increase in NE output relative to baseline. In Experiment 2, methyl atropine was given 10 min before VNS to assess whether stimulation-induced increases in amygdala NE are mediated by afferent or efferent vagal branches. Methyl atropine did not alter NE release in the BLA in comparison with saline. The significance of these findings in understanding how peripheral neural activity modulates limbic structures to encode and store new information into memory is discussed.},

annote = {Our pursuit ofHRVas an index of self-regulation was based on
anatomical overlap between brain structures associated with self-regulation and those associated with autonomic inhibition

index of a parasympathetically mediated inhibitory system and self-regulation. One major task of most organisms is to effect- ively utilize available energy to meet environmental demands, for example, by redirecting energy to the heart and large muscles during ‘‘fight or flight.'' In contrast to the physical demands of fight or flight, self-regulation usually requires mental effort and is often a matter of not acting; under such demands, it may be adaptive to engage the ‘‘vagal brake'' to reduce energy demands in the periphery, make glucose available for the metabolic costs of mental effort, and promote calm reflection (Fairclough {\&} Houston, 2004; Porges, 2001).

Self-regulation:
Experimental evidence indicates that self-regulatory strength— the ability to meet self-regulatory demands such as inhibiting impulses, making decisions, persisting at difficult tasks, and controlling emotions—is a resource that can be spent.

expending self-regulatory strength by eating un- desirable foods in the presence of desirable foods, making choices, and suppressing thoughts or emotions created subse- quent deficits in persistence at and performance on cognitive and motor tasks (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, {\&} Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, {\&} Baumeister, 1998).

Self-regulatory strength may therefore be analogous to muscle strength: The more effort is expended, the more the self-regulatory ‘‘muscle'' is fatigued, and the less strength remains for further efforts (Mu- raven {\&} Baumeister, 2000). This fatigue can lead to lapses of self-regulation.

Without an index of self-regulatory strength and fatigue—an electromyograph for the self-regulatory muscle— the concept of self-regulatory strength is difficult to apply empirically to naturalistic settings, in which a failure of self- regulation (e.g., eating a doughnut while on a diet) could be construed both as the indicator of self-regulatory fatigue and as the consequence of that fatigue.

how much self-regulatory strength people have available, how much self-regulatory effort they are expending, and whether they are vulnerable to the negative consequences of self-regulatory fatigue

HRV:
A measure of parasympathetic control over the heart, heart
rate variability (HRV), offers just such an opportunity. Para- sympathetic input to the heart via the efferent vagus nerve affects heart rate acceleration and deceleration related to res- piration: The heart speeds up after inspiration and slows down after expiration. More parasympathetic input results in more pronounced acceleration and deceleration and more variable intervals between heart beats, that is, higher HRV.

likely candidate to index self-regulatory capacity and activity because brain structures involved in self-regulation and those involved in autonomic nervous system regulation overlap considerably, particularly with regard to the prefrontal cortex.

Self- regulatory tasks are associated with activation of prefrontal cortex, and self-regulatory fatigue adversely and selectively affects performance on cognitive tasks that are considered to be frontal or executive (Schmeichel, Vohs, {\&} Baumeister, 2003; Small, Zatorre, Dagher, Evans, {\&} Jones-Gotman, 2001).

Prefrontal cortices form part of the central autonomic network (CAN), which also includes the anterior cingulate, insula, amygdala, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray (Thayer {\&} Lane, 2000).

The CAN is in part responsible for parasympa- thetic input to the heart, as demonstrated by a decrease in HRV after cortical anesthesia (Ahern et al., 2001)

We predicted that self-regulatory effort would covary with
HRV, such that higherHRVwould reflect greater self-regulatory effort

H1: posited higher HRV during high self-regulatory effort compared with low self- regulatory effort
- further expected that tonic self-regulatory strength or capacity should be reflected in higher tonic HRV

Higher resting HRV has been associated with a number of potential indicators of self-regulatory capacity, including better performance on executive cognitive tasks, less negative emotion during daily stress, more effective coping with stress, and better impulse control (Allen, Matthews, {\&} Kenyon, 2000; Fabes {\&} Eisenberg, 1997; Hansen, Johnsen, {\&} Thayer, 2003; Johnsen et al., 2003).

H2: higher resting HRV should predict later self-regulatory capacity.

H3: the subjective and physio- logical effects of high self-regulatory effort would differ from those of a typical laboratory stress activity. Specifically, we expected high self-regulatory effort to be differentiated from low self-regulatory effort not by subjective response, (but by higher HRV in contrast, a typical laboratory stress activity would be differentiated from a low-stress activity by a marked subjective response and lower HRV)

Method:
We experimentally manipulated self-regulatory effort by having subjects either resist or indulge in desirable foods (chocolate and cookies) and then measured their further ability to self- regulate, specifically, to persist at a difficult anagram task

Self-regulation condition: cookie/carrot condition

All subjects, who had fasted for the previous 3 hr, were presented for 5 min with a tray holding carrot sticks, warm chocolate-chip cookies, and chocolate candies in separate compartments. In the low- self-regulation condition (n 5 42), subjects were instructed to eat only the cookies or candies, but not the carrot sticks. In the high-self-regulation condition (n 5 41), they were instructed to eat only the carrot sticks, but not the cookies or candies

Cookies and chocolate were rated sig- nificantly more desirable than carrots, F(1, 78) 5 9.21, prep 5 .97, Z 5 .32

Anagram tasks:
They were given up to 5 min to work on an unsolvable anagram and up to 90 s each to work on 10 additional difficult but solvable anagrams. Time before giving up on or solving each anagram was measured by the experimenter with a stopwatch. To control for effects of total task time on physiological states during the anagram task and recovery, we required all subjects to go back and work on unsolved anagrams up to the total task time of 20 min.


Although self-con- sciousness is ordinarily associated with increased persistence on the anagram task (Solberg Nes et al., 2005), this persistence was absent among subjects who had previously exercised high self-regulatory effort, as reflected in a significant interaction between self-consciousness and self-regulation condition

Results:
self-regulatory effort affected subsequent persistence. effect of self-regulation condition and self-consciousness on persistence at the first, unsolvable anagram (i.e., self-regulatory fatigue)

Although self-con- sciousness is ordinarily associated with increased persistence on the anagram task (Solberg Nes et al., 2005), this persistence was absent among subjects who had previously exercised high self-regulatory effort, as reflected in a significant interaction between self-consciousness and self-regulation condition, B 5
?37.2, SE 5 8.2, t(77) 5 ?4.54, prep {\textgreater} .99, pr 5 .42

interaction moderated significant main effects of both self- consciousness,B514.1, SE54.6, t(77)53.09, prep5.97, and
self-regulation condition, B5?13.9, SE56.4, t(77)5?2.17, prep5.90; pr5.41

although subjects did not feel effects of self-regulatory fatigue as a result of eating carrots instead of cookies and chocolate, their subsequent lower persistence indicated self-regulatory fatigue

other experiments in which high self-regulatory effort caused later deficits in per- sistence (Baumeister et al., 1998; Muraven {\&}Slessareva, 2003; Muraven et al., 1998). Total time spent on the anagram task showed similar but attenuated effects—interaction between self-consciousness and condition:B5?122.0, SE580.3, t(77) 5?1.52, prep5.78, pr5.17; main effect of self-consciousness: B572.3, SE540.0, t(77)51.81, prep5.85; and main effect of self-regulation condition: B 5 ?57.1, SE 5 56.5, t(77) 5 ?1.01, prep 5 .63; pr 5 .24 for the main-effect step

Physiological Concomitants and Consequences of Self-Regulatory Effort:
- A good index of self-regulation should have at least the following two properties
First, it should differentiate tasks that require high self-regulatory effort from tasks that require low effort,
- Second, higher self-regulatory strength should predict better self-regulation, much as a stronger muscle can exert more force

As predicted, HRV was elevated during high self-regulatory
effort relative to low effort, as reflected in a significant inter- action of task (i.e., baseline, regulation, anagrams, rest) and self-regulation condition (high vs. low effort), F(4, 312)55.16, e 5 .79, p {\textless} .05, Z 5 .25

During the self- regulation task, subjects eating carrots, that is, those exerting a higher level of self-regulatory effort, had higher HRVrelative to baseline than did subjects eating cookies and chocolate


Finally, if HRV indexes self-regulatory strength as well as
effort, then greater tonic or baseline HRV should indicate greater self-control ability and predict later persistence. This was, in fact, the case. Higher HRV during the baseline period predicted longer persistence on the first anagram; HRV ac- counted for an additional 5{\%}of the variance in persistence after controlling for self-consciousness,B50.013, SE50.006, t(80) 52.14, prep5.90, pr5.22. As shown in Figure 3, higherHRV also predicted longer persistence on the first round of anagrams, B 5 1.56, SE 5 0.74, t(80) 5 2.10, prep5 .89, pr 5.22. HRV during the anagram task also predicted persistence, but not after accounting for baseline differences in HRV; that is, subjects with higher HRV during baseline also had higher HRV during the anagram task and also persisted longer at the task


Threat versus Challenge; Stress versus Self-regulation

Although subjects were unaware of self-regulatory effort and fatigue, they were subjectively aware of stress. The speech task was perceived as being much more difficult, stressful, and effortful than the relaxation task

Also unlike the self-regulation manipulation, the stress ma- nipulation did not result in subsequent differences in persistence


Finally, the physiological concomitants of stress differed from
those of self-regulation. Speaking was associated with lower HRV, higher HR, and higher SCL than was relaxing, but there were no significant differences between conditions during other tasks. All task-by-stress-condition (high vs. low stress) interactions were significant

These effects are consistent with results of previous investigations into the effects of speech stress on HRV in particular and autonomic change in general (e.g., Burleson et al., 1998; Farag et al., 2003; Hughes {\&} Stoney, 2000).

self-regulation differed from stress in three im-
portant ways: Self-regulatory effort and fatigue were not well described by subjective difficulty, stress, or mood, whereas stress was; self-regulatory effort and fatigue resulted in later persistence deficits, whereas stress did not; and self-regulatory effort and fatigue were accompanied by higher HRVand lower HR and afterward by increases in SCL, whereas stress was ac- companied by lower HRV, higher HR, and higher SCL, but no differences afterward.},

In two experiments, we investigated the relationship between individual differences in cardiac vagal tone and top-down and bottom-up processes associated with emotional attention. To help determine the role of cortical and subcortical mechanisms underlying top-down and bottom-up emotional attention, fearful faces at broad, high, and low spatial frequency were presented as cues that triggered either exogenous or endogenous orienting. Participants with lower heart rate variability (HRV) exhibited faster attentional engagement to low-spatial-frequency fearful faces at short stimulus-onset asynchronies, but showed delayed attentional disengagement from high-spatial-frequency fearful faces at long stimulus-onset asynchronies in contrast to participants with higher HRV. This research suggests that cardiac vagal tone is associated with more adaptive top-down and bottom-up modulation of emotional attention.

annote = {Higher resting HRV is associated with more adaptive and functional top-down and bottom-up cognitive modulation of emotional stimuli, which may facilitate effective emotion regulation

Conversely, lower resting HRV is associated with hyper- vigilant and maladaptive cognitive responses to emotional stimuli, which may impede emotion regulation


Thayer and Lane (2000, 2002) proposed the neurovisceral integration model, which suggests that neural networks implicated in autonomic, emotional, and cognitive self-regulation are also involved in the control of cardiac autonomic activity

Our recent research begins to uncover how cardiac vagal tone indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with top-down and bottom-up visual perception and attention to emotional stim- uli, which may play a critical role in regulating the impact of negative emotion – termed as emotion regulation (Gross, 1998; Gross and Thompson, 2007).


SELF-REGULATION AND THE CENTRAL AUTONOMIC NETWORK (CAN)

Self-regulation refers to the ability to regulate thoughts, emo- tions, and behaviors, thereby allowing people to choose responses that are appropriate for different situational demands (Gross, 1998; Thayer and Lane, 2000; Segerstrom and Nes, 2007; Park et al., 2014).

central autonomic network (CAN; Benar- roch, 1993; Thayer and Lane, 2000; Thayer et al., 2009). The CAN has been implicated in making visceromotor, neuroen- docrine, and behavioral responses that are adaptive and flexible for various environmental demands (Thayer and Lane, 2000; Thayer et al., 2009; Park et al., 2013a)

The structures of the CAN include
the anterior cingulate, 
the insula, 
the ventromedial prefrontal cortices, 
the central nucleus of the amygdala, 
the paraventricular and related nuclei of the hypothalamus (ancient vagus?)
periaquaductual gray matter, 
the parabrachialnucleus, 
the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), 
the nucleus ambiguous, 
the ventrolateral medulla, 
the ventromedial medulla, 
and the medullary tegmental field, 

These brain structures in the CAN are reciprocally connected, and information can flow in both top- down and bottom-up fashions (Thayer and Lane, 2000)

In particular, the prefrontal-subcortical inhibitory circuits within the CAN play a critical role in self-regulatory function (Heatherton andWagner, 2011).

Under normal circumstances, the prefrontal cortex identifies safety cues from the environment and exerts its inhibitory control over sympathoexcitatory subcortical circuits, including the central nucleus of the amygdala

This prefrontal regulation makes it possible for an organism to make responses that are optimal for different sit- uational demands (Thayer et al., 2009; Park et al., 2013a)

In threatening and uncertain situations, the prefrontal inhibitory regulation diminishes and sympathoexcitatory subcortical circuits make default threat responses (Park et al., 2013a)

As such, prefrontal-subcortical inhibitory circuits play a role in various regulatory behaviors, including appetite, attitudes, and prejudice

Reduced prefrontal regulation can lead to hyperactive subcortical activity, which results in prolonged activation of defensive behavior mechanisms, including hyper-vigilance and perseverative cognition (e.g., worry or rumination; Thayer et al., 2009; Park et al., 2013a)

prefrontal-subcortical circuits has been associated with a wide range of psychopathologies, including depression (Davidson et al., 2002; Johnstone et al., 2007), anxi- ety (KimandWhalen, 2009), schizophrenia (Callicott et al., 2003; Lewis et al., 2005), and addictive behavior (for a review, see Li and Sinha, 2008).

THE NEUROVISCERAL INTEGRATION MODEL:
the functioning of prefrontal-subcortical inhibitory circuits critical for self-regulation is linked with the heart via the vagus nerve that provides inhibitory inputs to the heart (see also Levy, 1971; Benarroch, 1993; Ellis and Thayer, 2010).

Most noticeably, a recent meta-analysis (Thayer et al.,2012) revealed that resting HRV is tied to the functioning of prefrontal- subcortical circuits, such that higher resting HRV is associated with the effective functioning of prefrontal-subcortical inhibitory circuits that support flexible and adaptive responses to environmental demands

Indeed, research has indicated that people with higher resting HRV exhibit effective behavioral responses (e.g., faster response times and better accuracy) on executive cognitive tasks (Hansen et al., 2003) as well as flexible and adaptive emotional responding (Ruiz-Padial et al., 2003; Thayer et al., 2009).

research has indicated that people with higher resting HRV exhibit effective behavioral responses (e.g., faster response times and better accuracy) on executive cognitive tasks (Hansen et al., 2003) as well as flexible and adaptive emotional responding (Ruiz-Padial et al., 2003; Thayer et al., 2009). In contrast, lower resting HRV is associated with hypoactive prefrontal regulation; this results in hyperactive subcortical structures, which leads to maladaptive cognitive and emotional self-regulation.

For example, people with lower resting HRV often fail to recognize safety cues or to habituate to novel, neutral stimuli (hyper-vigilance; for a review, see Hansen et al., 2003; Friedman, 2007; Park et al., 2012a).

Additionally, people with lower resting HRV responded to neutral stimuli with heightened startle and neural responses as if the stimuli were emotionally negative (Ruiz-Padial et al., 2003; Park et al., 2012a).

Evidently there is a link between HRV and the prefrontal-subcortical circuits critical for cognitive and emotional self-regulation.

HRV AND TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP VISUAL PERCEPTION OF EMOTIONAL STIMULI

Broad Spatial Frequency (BSF): 
High Spatial Frequency (HSF) - perception, colour, {\&} contrast
Low Spatial Frequency (LSF) - depth, motion, low contrast B{\&}W

Emotional messages at LSF appear to be processed directly via the amygdala and subcortical mechanisms (Park et al., 2012b)

It has been suggested that discriminating emotions using HSF information is difficult, whereas discriminating emotions using LSF information is relatively easy (Mermillod et al., 2008).When statistical properties of fearful and neutral faces with different spatial frequency information were analyzed, the statistical distri- butions of HSF fearful and neutral faces overlapped completely so that it was difficult for observers to discriminate emotion using HSF information; however, the statistical distributions of LSF fearful and neutral faces were so distinctive that it was easy to discriminate emotion using LSF information (Mermil- lod et al., 2008)

discriminating emotions using LSF is an easy task, whereas discriminating emotions using HSF is a difficult task that may require greater executive function mediated by the prefrontal cortex'

In our recent study (Park et al., 2012b), participants were presented with fearful and neutral faces at BSF, HSF, and LSF for 200 ms and asked to discriminate the emotion of each face as quickly and accurately as possi- ble. The results showed that people with higher resting HRV were capable of identifying HSF fearful faces more accurately than people with lower resting HRV. Thus, as predicted, there was a positive association between HRV and task performance (e.g., accuracy) on discriminating the emotion of HSF fearful faces

Furthermore, we examined whether the top-down influence of different processing goals would modulate the relationship between HRV and the bottom-up visual perception of HSF fearful faces.

A previous study revealed that the utilization of spatial frequency information depends on processing goals (Schyns and Oliva, 1999). When people were asked to discriminate the emo- tion of hybrid face stimuli (i.e., happy, neutral, and angry), they primarily utilized LSF information. In contrast, when people were asked to discriminate whether the stimuli were expressive or not, they utilized HSF information. Thus, the utilization of HSF information facilitates the discrimination of expressive- ness (Schyns and Oliva, 1999).

Consistent with this view, our results showed that the positive relationship between resting HRV and task performance observed in the emotion discrimination task diminished in the expressiveness discrimination task:

Initial evidence that cardiac vagal tone is positively associated with the bottom-up processing of visual discrimination of emotion in HSF fearful faces, which is modulated by the top-down influence of different processing goals

HRV AND TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP EMOTIONAL ATTENTION

neural structures implicated in atten- tional systems, such as the pulvinar, the cingulate, and the fronto-parietal cortex, influence and are influenced by affective processing (Okon-Singer et al., 2013; for a review, see Pessoa and Adolphs,2011)

Our research demonstrates that indi- vidual differences in resting HRV are associated with the ability to control different attentional systems in response to emotional stimuli

Emotional attention refers to a phenomenon in which emotional stimuli aremore likely tomodulate one's attention (Pourtois and Vuilleumier, 2006;see Vuilleumier and Brosch, 2009, for a review).

Emotional attention has been extensively studied using Posner's spatial cuing paradigm (for a review, see Posner and Peterson,1990; Posner andRothbart,2007) todisentanglehowdif- ferent attentional components are involved in affective processing (Vuilleumier, 2005; Pourtois andVuilleumier, 2006)

Two different types of attentional orienting have been identified: (a) exogenous and (b) endogenous attentional orienting (Posner and Peterson, 1990; Bartolomeo et al., 2001; Posner and Roth- bart, 2007).

- Exogenous orienting is characterized as a bottom-up, reflexive orienting mode that is associated with neural activity of the posterior attention system, which includes the superior pari- etal cortex, pulvinar, and superior colliculus (Posner and Peterson, 1990;Huang-Pollock and Jigg,2003; Berger et al.,2005; Posner and Rothbart, 2007).

Exogenous orienting is typically observed when the duration between the onset of a cue and the onset of a target [stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA)] is short, peaking at 150 ms

- Endogenous orienting is characterized as a top-down, voluntary attentional mode, and is associatedwith the anterior attention sys- tem, which includes the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex (Posner and Peterson, 1990;Huang-Pollock and Jigg, 2003; Berger et al., 2005; Posner and Rothbart, 2007). 

Endogenous orienting is typically observed when the majority of the cues are valid at long SOAs (e.g.,{\textgreater}300 ms). People notice that a target is more likely to appear where a preceding cue is presented and strategically exert voluntary attentional control (Coull et al., 2000; Bartolomeo et al., 2001).

when emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful faces) are presented as cues in the task, people are faster to detect targets in valid trials (faster attentional engagement) and slower to disengage attention away from cues in invalid trials (slower attentional disengagement;Mathews et al., 1997; Fox et al., 2002; Koster et al., 2006;Verkuil et al., 2009; Cisler and Koster, 2010).

faster engagement to and slower disengagement from fearful faces are construed as maladaptive because faster engagement indicates hyper-vigilance to threaten- ing stimuli, and slower attentional disengagement indicates the failure to inhibit attention from them (Fox et al., 2002; Verkuil et al., 2009)

For example, it has been well established that people with high anxiety exhibit faster attentional engagement to and slower attentional disengagement from threatening stimuli compared to healthy controls (Mathews et al., 1997; Koster et al., 2006; Cisler and Koster, 2010).

Fearful faces as threat stimuli: 
neural mechanisms of the posterior attentional system,which includes the superior pari- etal cortex, pulvinar, and superior colliculus (Pourtois et al.,2005)

Not only that, but the same subcortical structures are implicated in processing LSF fearful faces. 

Taking the evidence together, attentional engagement to LSF fearful face cues under the exogenous attention mode can be construed as a bottom-up mode of emotional attention because they are all associated with activity in subcortical neural mechanisms (Park et al., 2013b).

In contrast, attentional disengagement from fearful face cues in invalid trials is associated with increased activity of the ventro- medial prefrontal cortex, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (Pourtois and Vuilleumier, 2006)

Thus, both attentional disengagement from fearful face cues and endogenous attention are associated with activity in prefrontal neural structures. Not only that, but the prefrontal structures are also implicated in pro- cessing HSF fearful faces. Taking the evidence together, attentional disengagement from HSF fearful face cues under the endoge- nous mode can be construed as a top-down mode of emotional attention because they are all associated with activity in cortical neural mechanisms (Park et al., 2013b)

HRV and top-down (endogenous cues, disengagement from HSF fearful faces) versus bottom-up (exogenous cues, LSF fearful faces):

Study 1:

1. People with lower resting HRV showed significantly faster attentional engagement to LSF fearful faces relative to people with higher resting HRV at short SOAs (250 ms; Experiment 1) sug- gesting hyper-vigilant responses to threatening stimuli primilarly tapping into subcortical mechanisms

2. However, with longerSOAs, (960 ms), people with lower resting HRV showed significantly slower attentional disengagement from HSF fearful faces relative to people with higher resting HRV, suggesting the failure to inhibit attention from threatening stimuli primarily tapping into cortical mechanisms

These findings provide initial evidence that individual differences in restingHRVare associatedwith top- down and bottom-up emotional attention

People with higher resting HRV – associated with highly functional emotional and cognitive self-regulatory systems – showmore adaptive top-down and bottom-up emotional attention,whichmay facilitate effective emotion regulation

In contrast, people with lower resting HRV – associated with poor emotional and cognitive self-regulatory systems – show maladaptive top-down and bottom-up emotional attention,whichmay be detrimental to emotion regulation

Study 2:
individual differences in resting HRV predict the functioning of inhibitory attentional mechanisms critical for top- down emotional attention (Park et al., 2012c).

Inhibition of Return:
(IOR) refers to the inhibitory attentional mechanism that prevents one's attention from going back to previously attended areas, thereby facilitating adaptive search (Posner and Cohen, 1984; Posner et al., 1985; Klein and MacInnes, 1999; Taylor and Therrien, 2005; Sumner, 2006; Stoyanova et al., 2007). Although people's attention is initially drawn to the location of a stimu- lus, it is diverted to explore new locations when the location of the stimuli is irrelevant to the task and there is time to shift (Park et al., 2012c). Extensive research has revealed that there are at least two separate neural mechanisms of IOR: (a) col- licular (retinotectal) and (b) cortical mechanisms, including the temporo-parietal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, which are typically associated with attentional control.

We examined whether:
1. individual differences in HRV would predict the IOR to emotional and neutral face cues (Park et al., 2012c). 
2. whether the relationship between HRV and IOR to emotional stimuli depended on different neural pathways of IOR.

FIndings:
In general, people with lower restingHRVfailed to demonstrate the IOR effect, indicating reduced inhibitory function

In contrast, people with higher resting HRV demonstrated a typical IOR effect,which was even more pronounced in response to HSF fearful faces that tapped into the cortical based IOR (Sumner, 2006)

These findings demonstrate that people with higher resting HRV are capable of controlling inhibitory attention, highly instrumental in top-down emotional attention,whereas peoplewith lowrestingHRVare less capable of controlling it.

PHASIC HRV AND COGNITIVE EMOTION REGULATION

Phasic HRV suppression has been construed as an autonomic response to stress, which reflects the withdrawal of cardiac vagal con- trol and the activation of the defensive systems to cope with a stressor (Thayer et al., 1996; Park et al., 2014) 

eg Exercise: a stressor!

For example, when people were exposed to a video clip triggering stress such as depicting an escalating conflict (Beauchaine et al., 2007; El- Sheikh et al., 2011), asked to perform a difficult mental stress task (Weber et al., 2010), or engaging in worry and fear or anger imagery (Lyonfields et al., 1995; Thayer et al., 1996), phasic HRV suppression was observed.

Conversely, phasic HRV enhance- ment has been construed as the exertion of self-regulatory effort while engaging in emotional regulation (e.g., employing emo- tion self-regulatory methods such as suppression or reappraisal) or performing a task that requires self-regulatory effort (Butler et al., 2006; Segerstrom and Nes, 2007)

For example, phasic HRV enhancement was observed when participants were instructed to eat only carrots, which demanded greater self-regulatory effort, compared to when instructed to eat only cookies, demanded less self-regulatory effort. Phasic HRV enhancement was even more pronounced in people with higher resting HRV (Segerstrom and Nes, 2007).

Additionally, greater phasic HRV enhancement was observed, when female participants were exposed to an upset- ting film and then asked to regulate emotion by engaging in emotion suppression (i.e., suppressing emotional expressions) or emotion reappraisal (i.e., reappraising a situation to gener- ate desired emotions), compared to controls (Butler et al., 2006).

a recent neuroimaging finding revealed that phasic HRV enhancement was correlated with greater activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex associated with emotional regulation (Lane et al., 2013).

However, under high load, people with higher rest- ing HRV were faster in conditions with neutral distractors, but not with fearful distractors, whereas people with lower resting HRV were slower in conditions with both fearful and neutral distractors (Park et al., 2013a)

More importantly, people with lower resting HRV showed phasic HRV suppression, which sug- gested making an autonomic stress response, in the conditions with fearful distractor faces under both low and high load (Park et al., 2014).

Thus, people with lower resting HRV appeared to make autonomic stress responses to trivial threat cues as if the cues were significant stressors.

Thus, people with higher resting HRV were capa- ble of exerting emotion regulatory effort in response to fearful distractors under low load when processing resources were avail- able under low load. However, people with higher resting HRV did not make an autonomic stress response, even under high load when task performance could be potentially stressful

The results are consistent with a previous study reporting that pha- sic HRV enhancement were observed in healthy individuals with higher resting HRV and phasic HRV suppression in patients suf- fering from social anxiety disorder characterized by lower resting HRV in response to emotionally negative stimuli (Gaebler et al., 2013).

IMPLICATION OF HRV ON INDIVIDUAL WELL-BEING AND MENTAL HEALTH

healthy individuals with lower resting HRV demonstrate heightened activity in the middle occipital gyrus and the cuneus during visual perception of emotionalandneutral stimuli,whichare typically observed in people with high risk of psychosis (Park et al., 2012a)

For example, it has been well established that peoplewith high anxiety are characterized by attentional bias favoring threatening stimuli (Lee and Park, 2011). Schizophrenic patients also exhibit impaired visual perception of emotional facial expressions (see Edwards et al.,2002, for a review).

lower resting HRV is associated with hyper-vigilant and maladaptive bottom-up and impaired top-down cognitive response to emotional stimuli. These studies raise the possibility that lower resting HRV may be a predispos- ing factor that increases the susceptibility of developing emotional and psychiatric problems (Park et al., 2012a)

several studies provided evidence that resting
HRV is associated with the ability to control autonomic responses (Butler et al., 2006; SegerstromandNes, 2007; Gaebler et al., 2013; Park et al., 2014). People with lower resting HRV showed an autonomic stress response, phasic HRV suppression, to fearful stimuli, indicating that they interpret seemingly mild stimuli as a significant stressor (Gaebler et al., 2013; Pa},

It has long been assumed that these effects are related to stimulation-induced increases of norepinephrine (NE) release in limbic brain structures. The present study examined this hypothesis by administering VNS at an intensity and duration that improves memory and then measuring fluctuations in NE output in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) with in vivo microdialysis. In Experiment 1, VNS caused a 98{\%} increase in NE output relative to baseline. In Experiment 2, methyl atropine was given 10 min before VNS to assess whether stimulation-induced increases in amygdala NE are mediated by afferent or efferent vagal branches. Methyl atropine did not alter NE release in the BLA in comparison with saline. The significance of these findings in understanding how peripheral neural activity modulates limbic structures to encode and store new information into memory is discussed.},

Discarding amodal systems, however, would have profound effects not only on the cognitive sciences, but also on the broader study of human behaviour. During the last two decades, cognitivist theories have made their entrance into humanistic studies, including the study of religion. Thus, in discarding one of the basic premises of the cognitive paradigm, as I argue in this article, could lead to a radical rethinking of the science of religion. I will argue that the body and its sensory-motor modalities are not only the mind's representational base, but also encompass the intentionality behind human behaviour in general and religious behaviour in particular. I will call this intentionality homeostatic intentionality, as it has to do with the self-regulation and optimization of the organism. Ignoring physiological activities, including homeostatic ones, in the mind's complex cognitive processes is unfortunately a characteristic of classic cognitivist theories, and this negligence, it seems to me, rules out a satisfying and realistic account of religious behaviour.},

History of Classic Cog Science:
Noam Chomsky started the cognitive revolution by strongly criticiz- ing B.F. Skinner's Conditioning Th eory of Language Acquisition. Chomsky's article (1959) marks

the brain is subject to a set of predisposed procedures either in the shape of inductive and deductive inferences made explicit by propositional representations (e.g., the predicate calculus), or in the shape of rule based systems, or schemata and scripts.

First, cognitive procedures are hypothesized independently of the brain's neurobiological underpinnings. 

Second, the systems operate by symbols in sentence-like structures no matter what information is processed or how the systems are organized. 

When I use the term classic cognitivism I am referring to cogni- tive theories and models that rely on these two premises from the AI and linguistic tradition.

One of them is the binding problem. Th e German Princess Elizabeth was
the fi rst to wonder about it, so she asked Descartes how material stuff was able to connect with immaterial quantities. “Th rough the pineal gland,” Descartes answered. Now about 350 years after Descartes' death, we still do not have a likely answer to that question and the binding problem has not been taken seriously in the cognitive sciences.

the homunculus problem. If the mind is sepa-
rated from the modalities and is controlling the body, then who is controlling the mind? Once again the inquisitive princess got an answer from Descartes, “Don't think about it!”


Analogical thinking: the cognitive apparatus converts analogical signals from the sensory input systems into symbolic forms. Visual stimuli are thought to be transduced from modal rep- resentations in the retinal receptors through primary visual systems to discrete symbols in an amodal inference system.

In these amodal systems, the symbols act as units in sentence-like structures subject to logical or rule-based proce- dures. Most commonly, these procedures are made explicit in propositional representations where amodal symbols are placed in grammatical relations.

the propositional representations are char- acterized by being:
– Discrete: made of arbitrary unit, e.g., letters. – Explicit: the symbols are represented explicitly in propositions. 
– Strong combination rules: the function of a particular symbol depends on the grammatical position in the proposition.
– Amodal: regardless of modality (e.g., visual, auditory, olfactory etc.) the information is represented as symbols made of arbitrary units

Thus, they constitute a universal, amodal, mentalese. By mentalese, we mean that propositions are a fundamental language or code that is used to represent all mental information (Eysenck and Keane, 2000, p. 247).


Amodal theories fail to explain why successful cognitive behaviour relies so heavily on sensory-motor activities.

Activities in the sensory modalities prior to the transduction into symbols are simply excluded from the cognitive process, and the sensory-motor systems are reduced to input/output channels for an amodal information processor

Th ere are no indications of any amodal systems underlying the sensory-motor representation of concepts.

cognitive processes
appear to utilize the same cortical systems that underlie perception. Th e fact is inconsistent with the amodality hypothesis of clear distinctions between modality-specifi c input systems and amodal processing of discrete symbols in propositional representations.

Likewise recent MR studies and neurobiological fi ndings support the idea that emotional content in concepts are represented by the actual visceral and somato-sensory systems involved in primary emotions (Damasio, 1994, p. 139).

Barsalou's Perceptual Symbol Systems Theory
propositional thought can be represented by modality-specific systems.

Colors, shapes, sounds, smells, proprioceptive and homeostatic representations are all represented as components in concepts and categories. The representational components are actual simulations of the neuronal activities during perception. Cognitive processes are thus reenactments of perceptual activities in the relevant modalities, which is why theories like Barsalou's are called simulation theories or reenactment theories

Th e sensory apparatus, e.g., vision, discriminates topographically between particular colors, shapes and contrasts storing each component of the optic fi eld separately in specifi c popu- lations. Barsalou calls these components perceptual symbols, and they repre- sent the base unit of the representational system involved in most cognitive processes including conceptualizations, propositions and complex inferences. Perceptual symbols are organized hierarchically linking colors, shapes and contrasts into more complex structures

The perceptual symbol systems constitute the basic units of the cognitive representations serving as parts of the simulation of objects, concepts and categories

Multimodal simulations of concepts are automatically represented as pat- tern completions always depending on the unique parameters of both internal simulations and stimuli from the external environment

Instead of being mere input channels for some amodal information processing unit, the sensory- motor system itself is the cognitive apparatus. Instead of looking for specifi c rules of syntactic and grammatical nature, to explain cognitive behaviour, simulation theories are looking for specifi c connections between the percep- tual symbol systems being simulated.

Damasio: Descartes' Error
According to Damasio, the neural underpinnings of conscious feelings and emotions are part of a larger function of the body, namely, homeostasis which constantly works to optimize the organism in the ever-changing milieu.

Basic functions like keeping the body at 37°C (thermostasis), adjust- ing blood sugar levels (glucostasis), preparing the body in fi ght-or-fl ight situ- ations or relaxing it in rest-or-digest situations (primary emotions), and even making complex decisions and following eff ective social strategies are all viewed as integrated features of the organism's homeostatic striving for regu- lation and optimization.

The exciting thing about Damasio's findings is that even conscious representa- tions of our changing body states use the homeostatic systems of the brain to represent itself.

Damasio stresses how unique emotional traits of humans are represented by older and much more fundamental physiological mechanisms. Secondary emotions integrated in concepts and categories utilize the same mechanisms as primary emotional responses do

Although the level of bodily activity varies in the emotional representation, corresponding to the potency of stimuli, emo- tion participates in the cognitive processes through its cortical representations in the somatosensory areas of the parietal lobes.

With primary emotions, the whole machinery of the body is mobilized to actually prepare the organism for threats or important stimuli, e.g., increasing heartbeat, relaxing airways and dilating pupils. With some of the secondary emotions, however, only the intracranial structures of the systems underlying primary emotions are mobilized leaving out the actual changes of body states.

The conscious expression of secondary emotions varies in complexity corresponding to the amount of bodily activity invested in the representation.

Like primary emotions, the most salient secondary emotions are represented by actual changes in the body. Damasio calls these emotions body loops since they are using the whole machinery of the body to express themselves

Secondary emotions using body loops are the most accessible to our conscious experience. During less salient emotions, the brain only represents what the physical changes would be like in relation to a certain stimulus, e.g., object, concept, category or future outcome of decision-making. Damasio calls these ‘as if loops', since they only simulate homeostatic changes in the brain without actually changing it. 

The as if loops are also named somatic markers as they mark a specifi c body state in relation to a future scenario by simulating either pleasant or unpleasant body states in the somato-sensory cortex during cogni- tion (Damasio, 1994, p. 174)

Somatic markers are, thus, reduced patterns of emotional activity learned by recurrent interaction with the environment to save the body from demanding visceral changes in situations where the organism does not benefit from actually preparing the body.

Damasio is thus operating with a hierarchical understanding of emotions with conscious feelings at the top, while unconscious markers of body states are at the bottom. Between these two, a whole spectrum of representational levels of emotional intensity can be plotted onto a continuous scale: 

next to feelings are intuitions and gut feelings utilizing actual body loops, while unconscious somatic markers of pain or pleasure guide our decision-making using only as if loops

Damasio even hypothesizes that somatic markers help sustain attention in working memory evaluating stimuli at the most basic level of brain processing (Damasio, 1994, pp. 197–198).

Emotions, then, modulate our cognitive processes at all levels guiding our behaviour both consciously and unconsciously as part of homeostasis.

Homeostatic Intentionality:
In this way, the homeostatic systems of the body hold a kind of intentionality always aiming to adapt and optimize the organism in the environment.

Together with an eff ective working memory, a fi ne-grained cortical discrimi- nation of stimuli and a highly developed language capacity, which make plan- ning and deferment of needs possible (Rolls, 1999, p. 261),9
we have the power to inhibit signals of hunger if deferment could lead to advantages in the future

Epistemic thought, social bond- ing, planning, learning complex strategies, are all fundamentally motivated and guided by reward or punishment

A key principle of the nervous system is the hierarchical organization of resource mobilization. It is the intensity of the homeostatic signals that decides on what level of behavioural complexity the individual reacts to the environ- ment (Damasio, 1994, p. 157)

For the signal to reach the conscious mind it has to be of a certain intensity, and intense signals are only mobilized if less resourceful reactions fail to cope with the situation (automatic regulatory processes). In other words you only ride your bike to the store on a rainy day if your body really needs it

Thus, the cognitive reactions to the body's homeostatic intentionality correspond to the intensity of the homeostatic signals (Damasio, 1994, p. 157) so that weak somatic markers in concepts and events (as if loops) trigger only weak reactions to support attention or to guide a non-conscious selection of behavioural actions, while strong somatic markers utilizing the full machinery of the body (body loops) trigger stronger reactions like conscious feelings and intuitions.

Th e need for chocolate, however, is potentially engaged by multiple levels of complexity at the same time: the autonomic nervous system is constantly regulating the internal milieu, while the conscious mind's complex cortical processes are mobilized only if the homeostatic signals are intensifi ed and demanding its attention

Coping:
Coping is not just the mind's way of adapting to new challenges. It is an organism-oriented behaviour striving to maintain the organism in its entirety, both mentally and physically. 

The different levels of reaction to the homeostatic intentionality should be conceived of as a continuous scale. Complex conscious cognitive processes are fundamentally manifestations of the same kind of activity as the automatic reactions 
of the organism

An illustrious example showing this intimate relation can be found in J. Weiss' classic experiments with rats, where the rat's anticipation of electric shock reduces the level of stress measured by the development of ulcers (Bloom et al., 2001, p. 266).

An illustrious example showing this intimate relation can be found in J. Weiss' classic experiments with rats, where the rat's anticipation of electric shock reduces the level of stress measured by the development of ulcers (Bloom et al., 2001, p. 266). Two rats received electric shock, one of them was warned by a sound right before the shock associating it with the pain induction, while the other rat only got random sounds. Th e fi rst rat, which was able to anticipate the pain stimulus cognitively, developed very few ulcers compared to the control rat, which had no chance to cope with the situation.

Bower et al. interviewed HIV-infected partners of deceased patients with AIDS (Schwarzer and Knoll, 2003, p. 401). Th e per- sons reporting to have found a meaning in their loss kept a relatively higher level of CD4 T cells compared to the control group, indicating a more eff ec- tive state of the immune system, and had a lower death rate in the period after the interviews

Other experiments show how specifi c coping strategies corre- late positively with physical health in specifi c situations (Aldwin and Park, 2004, pp. 277–281). At the same time, it is worth noticing the obvious nega- tive physiological eff ects resulting from insuffi cient coping or negative coping, e.g., among people with mental disorders; nutritional problems by anorectics, apoplexy as a consequence of stress, substance abuse and in worst case suicide.

Coping psychologists operate with two types of coping behaviour, one ori- ented outwards to master challenges in the environment, the other oriented inwards to maintain coherence in the mental apparatus

mastery coping and meaning coping

Mastery coping comprises behavioural strategies that optimize the
organism's life condition by mastering external demands. If a person is diag- nosed with diabetes, eff ective mastery coping would include a healthier diet and an optimal medication. Meaning coping aims at the mental restructuring that works to fi t the individual to a specifi c situation or a new life condition

Important events and changed life conditions are integrated as meaning- ful narratives in the subject's world view and autobiographical self in order to free necessary resources of the mind for other purposes and such world views are often provided by religion

Religious coping
religious coping is mobilized particularly during extreme crises


MODEL FOR COPING:
1. Barsalou's PSS theory: shows how either external or internal stimuli trigger multimodal pattern completions.
2. Damasio's SM hypothesis shows how homeostatic systems as part of these pattern completions are central to cognition at all levels of behaviour. 
3. insights from the coping psychology show how the organism mobilizes both internal and external strategies to cope with the homeostatic states.

the model replicates the dynamics of neural activity along the following lines: 
- pattern completions containing simulations of emotions initiating both internal and external reactions creating new pattern completions and so forth. 

Homeostatic intentionality is the organism's liability to react to the emotions

Different Levels of Behavioural and Representational Complexity (Fig.4):
Th e outermost lane represents unconscious and
minimal somatic representation, while the center of the spiral represents conscious and intense feelings by massive changes in body state. Reaction levels: the bodily response depends on the HI. Th e spiral's outer lane represents automatic reactions, while the inner lanes represent complex coping strategies.

One of the main points with the Perception–Emotion–Action model is that
cognitive behaviour, epistemic assumptions and complex actions can never be understood independently of the homeostatic activities

annote = {endorse pro-group action when either the personal or the social self is salient, when physiological arousal is high, or when they perceive that group members share essential qualities (e.g., genes, core values) with one another.

Strongly fused persons are especially inclined to endorse pro-group action when either the personal or the social self is salient, when physiological arousal is high, or when they perceive that group members share essential qualities (e.g., genes, core values) with one another

feelings of personal agency, perceptions of family-like ties to other group members, and a sense of group-related invulnerability mediate the link between identity fusion and pro-group behaviors

Indeed, dozens of studies have shown that measures of identity fusion outperform alter- native measures of group alignment (e.g., “identifica- tion”) in predicting endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors, including even sacrificing one's own life.

group identification, a construct that social iden- tity theorists developed to explain intergroup relations (Hornsey, 2008; Tajfel {\&} Turner, 1979; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, {\&} Wetherell, 1987)

although strongly fused persons align themselves with the collective, they nevertheless retain an agentic personal self and cultivate close ties to fellow group members as well as to the collective category

Evidence that identification and fusion are distinct constructs has come from demonstrations that items from scales measuring the two constructs load on separate fac- tors in factor analyses (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; see also Buhrmester et al., 2012)

and that fused persons and highly identified persons respond very differently to con- textual manipulations, such as arousal and threats to the personal or social
self (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; Swann, G{\'{o}}mez, Dovidio, Hart, {\&} Jetten, 2010; Swann, G{\'{o}}mez, Seyle, Morales, {\&} Huici, 2009).

Recognizing that it is rare to study people who are actively engaged in warfare, we also developed ways of measuring the propensity to self-sacrifice. One such measure is a 7-item self-report measure of intentions to fight and die on behalf of one's group (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011). As shown in Figure 1, fusion robustly predicted responses to the fight-and-die measure (controlling for identification) in 11 countries spanning six continents (Swann, Buhrmester, et al., 2014).

Trolley Dilemma: In a prototypical trolley dilemma, participants imagine that they are stand- ing on a bridge overlooking a set of train tracks. On the tracks below, they see that five countrymen are imperiled by a rapidly approaching train. Participants must choose between (a) standing idly by as their compatriots are killed or (b) jumping to their deaths, causing the train to stop before crushing their compatriots (Swann, G{\'{o}}mez, Dovidio, et al., 2010). Responses


Similarly, strongly fused persons have been shown to provide social or emotional support to fellow group members. In one cross-cultural investigation,
for example, Canadian, Chinese, and Indian participants played a resource- allocation computer game (Semnani-Azad, Sycara, {\&} Lewis, 2012). Participants who were strongly fused with their nation allocated more resources to their compatriots and made fewer selfish requests for aid than did weakly fused players.


1. Agentic Personal Self:

Perceptions of personal agency mediated the links between fusion and pro-group behav- ior (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; Swann et al., 2009). Such findings offer converging evidence for the causal role of the per- sonal self in the pro-group actions of strongly fused persons.

2. The identity-synergy principle

it should be possible to amplify the pro- group behavior of highly fused persons by activating either their personal or their social self-views.

Consistent with this prediction, activating highly fused persons' per- sonal selves (by asking them how they would react to a threat to their personal well-being) or their social selves (by asking them how they would react to a threat to their group) increased their subsequent endorsement of sacri- fices for the group (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011; Swann et al., 2009). In contrast, highly identified participants displayed more pro-group behavior in response to activating their social selves but not their personal selves

3. The relational-ties principle
Recognizes that strongly fused persons care about individual members of the group as well as the abstract collective. For this reason, strongly fused persons should be especially inclined to endorse sacrificing their own lives to save the lives of individual members of the group (e.g., when imperiled by a runaway trolley)

Apparently, highly fused persons view their group members as fictive family members, and these perceptions motivate them to take extreme actions on the behalf of these individuals. HOW?

But if the perception of family ties motivates willing- ness to self-sacrifice, why do people die for large groups and abstract causes? One possibility is that extended fusion entails the projection of relational ties onto geneti- cally unrelated group members, thereby transforming them into fictive kin (Atran, 2010).

when highly fused people perceive that group members share core characteristics, they are more likely to project the familial ties commonly found in smaller groups onto the extended group. Consistent with this reasoning, encouraging strongly fused persons to focus on shared core character- istics of their countrymen and -women increased their endorsement of making extreme sacrifices for their coun- try (Swann, Buhrmester,et al., 2014).

This pattern emerged whether the core characteristics were biological (genes) or psychological (core values) and whether par- ticipants were from China, India, the United States, or Spain

Furthermore, priming shared core values increased the feeling of familial ties among strongly fused group members, which, in turn, mediated the influence of fusion on endorsement of extreme sacrifices for the country.

Finally, whereas strongly fused persons knew immediately that self-sacrifice was the right thing to do, weakly fused persons arrived at this decision only by reflecting on the costs and benefits of various courses of action

These findings suggest that moral convictions are nec-
essary but not sufficient to motivate moral action. The fabric of people's social relationships—particularly their feelings of fusion with fellow group members—may often determine their willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice.



One goal will be to identify the contextual and personal variables that determine whether strongly fused persons pursue the goals of the group through violent versus peaceful activities},

annote = {When people think about themselves in relation to their religion-specific cosmos, they are engaging in dynamic feedback loops between their own emotional states and the cognitivity inherent in their belief (Azari et al., 2005; for affect- belief feedback loops in general, see Boden {\&} Berenbaum, 2010)

In other words, a person figures out their place in their cosmos, the causes and consequences of their behavior, and uses their emotional state as both antecedent and consequent of their reasoning (also see Russell et al., 2011).

focus on longer-term mood rather than fleeting emotion: Mood refers to a “background” emotional state that “rises and dissipates slowly”

Mood refers to a “background” emotional state that “rises and dissipates slowly” (Beedie, Terry, {\&} Lane, 2005, p. 871)

According to a number of studies, people think differently in a euphoric versus dysphoric mood (for a review, see Clore {\&} Huntsinger, 2007)

In a euphoric mood, people adopt a more global, schematic view. In other words, they tend to look at the “big picture.” In contrast, people in a dysphoric mood tend to be more non-schematic and details-oriented.

Bless et al. (1996) found that participants with an induced positive mood were more likely to falsely recognize an item from a story (when the stimulus is conceptually similar but a different word) than those in a negative mood. Participants in a positive mood appeared to fall back on general semantic knowledge whereas those in a negative mood remembered the details better

Gasper and Clore (2002) asked their participants to draw/ classify pictures they had seen before, and found that participants with an induced positive mood focused on the global characteristics at the expense of the details, while those in a negative mood did the opposite.

Beukeboom and Semin (2005) found the same results in a paradigm where they asked participants to choose appropriate phrases to describe behaviors: those in a good mood thought more about “why” a behavior occurred, and those in a bad mood thought more about “how” a behavior occurred.

Frederickson and Branigan (2005) confirmed the broadening effect of positive mood in a study where they asked participants to choose which image was the most similar to a previous one. The two choices were appropriate either for a global view (overall shape) or a detailed view (component parts of the overall shape). Those in a good mood chose overall shape more often.

Mood affects performance in a variety of domains outside of religion. For example, in
sports performance (Stevens, 2006) and school examinations (Thelwell, Lane, {\&} Weston, 2007), a person's background mood feeds into an assessment of the task (how well they can perform according to expectations) to produce a coping strategy.

Expertise:
The extent of a person's expertise makes a difference here too. If a task overwhelms a person's abilities, and success appears unlikely, then the mood might become depressed and performance might suffer; but if the task seems doable, then mood might contribute to success (for a discussion, see Stevens, 2006; Thelwell et al., 2007)

However, Pe, Tan, and Heller (2008) failed to find an advantage of mood in playing the TOH (and another game), although game success did improve mood afterward. Similarly, Spering, Wagener, and Funke (2005) failed to find an advantage of good mood in a complicated business simulation game.

However, positive mood does appear to have an advantage when the participant has prior experience of the game. 

Brand and Opwis (2007) asked participants to teach themselves (in dyads) to play the three-disk TOH and then afterward asked them to play similar types of games (five-disk TOH and two others). Participants in good moods performed better in these later games (as measured by solution time) than those with poorer moods

Conversely, Brand, Reimer, and Opwis (2007), using a similar paradigm with the same games, found that participants in a sad mood did worse in playing the later games. Presumably, those in a worse mood are less able to think schematically and therefore worse in analogical transfer.

by factoring the role of prior expertise (compared to other studies where experts have thousands of hours of practice, in this study we use the term “expertise” in a rather loose sense; on expertise, see Didierjean {\&} Gobet, 2008; Gobet, Chassy, {\&} Bilali{\'{c}}, 2011)


Six defining characteristics of ritual: 
(1) formalism (following conventional rules); 
(2) traditionalism (staying with traditional methods); 
(3) invariance (elements and ordering of ritual must stay the same); 
(4) rule governance (actions constrained by pre-specified rules); 
(5) sacral symbolism (acts have supernatural significance); and 
(6) performance (theatrical aspect).

Is it valid to construe a ritual as a kind of game? There are vivid examples in the literature to illustrate that rituals



Experiment:
In our experiment below, we investigate the role of a person's mood on their ability to transfer a skill from one context to another. We presume this is roughly equivalent to a religious person learning about their religion, and then needing to apply these principles out in the real world.

Tower of Hanoi (TOH) problem, a tricky game involving the transfer of disks over three pegs (for details, see Gardner, 2008; Simon, 1975).

the independent variables are expertise and mood in four conditions: (1) expert euphoric (EE); (2) expert dysphoric (ED); (3) nonexpert euphoric (NE); and (4) nonexpert dysphoric (ND).


Method:

Mood will be induced using film clips (see Methods). 

Expert participants will play the TOH first and then play a TOH isomorph, a version of the TOH game where the surface features have been substantially altered, but which has precisely the same rules 

Despite the fact that a TOH isomorph can be solved in exactly the same way as the TOH game, players often find it exceedingly difficult to solve the isomorph even after they have learned the original game (see Cl{\'{e}}ment {\&} Richard, 1997; Kotovsky, Hayes, {\&} Simson, 1985)

In our study, experts will have an opportunity to transfer their TOH skills to the BG task. Nonexpert participants will play the Missionary Cannibal (MC) game

Therefore, those who play MC prior to the BG task will not have an opportunity to transfer their skill. In the transfer context, individuals need to apply previously learned principles to a new context. Avery important point here is that the participants will not be told that the BG task is an isomorph

Although we would expect experts to perform better than nonexperts in the transfer
task (Gobet et al., 2011), previous literature motivates contradictory hypotheses with regard to the effects of mood

Predictions around mood:
Based on the aforementioned literature showing that euphoria is conducive to lateral thinking (e.g., Brand {\&} Opwis, 2007), we would predict that global thinkers will be better able to spot the analogical similarity between the BG task and the previously learned TOH game and then apply their TOH skills to the BG task (cf. Brand {\&} Opwis, 2007). 

By contrast, Whitehouse (1996) has predicted that dysphoria should enhance analogical reasoning as part of a process of “spontaneous exegetical reflection” (SER) on religious rituals (Whitehouse, 2004; also see Richert, Whitehouse, {\&} Stewart, 2005).

This prediction is congruent with later experiments (not related to SER) showing that, at least for simple visual displays, analogical reasoning is enhanced by experimentally induced anxiety (e.g., Feldman, Hristova, {\&} Kokinov 2010; Feldman {\&} Kokinov, 2009; Hristova {\&} Kokinov, 2011,

Whitehouse (1996, 2004) has conjectured that dysphoric rituals might trigger “flashbulb memory” (Luminet {\&} Curci, 2009): the phenomenon whereby people have unusually vivid recollection of circumstances surrounding emotional/traumatic events


Results:
For the H (Affect) dimension, the individuals were significantly happier in the euphoric than dysphoric conditions (t65 = 2.924, p = .005). For the V (Arousal) dimension, there was no significant difference (t65 = 0.920, p = .361).

As expected, expert individuals (those who played TOH prior to BG) solved significantly more games than the nonexpert individuals (Kruskal-Wallis $\chi$2 = 9.125, p = .003). We also analyzed

Surprisingly, there was no significant difference for mood (Kruskal-Wallis $\chi$2 = 0.198, p = .657) across the four conditions. Moreover, there was no significant difference between EE and ED (Kruskal-Wallis $\chi$2 = 1.291, p = .256) or between NE and ND (Kruskal-Wallis $\chi$2 = 0.018, p = .892)

Due to these problems, we used the ZIP regression, a test specifically designed for zero-heavy data

The euphoric (EE) condition was not a significant predictor of number of games solved (z = 0.93, p = .352). In contrast, the dysphoric (ED) condition was a highly significant predictor (z = 3.19, p = .001). Neither of the two nonexpert conditions (NE, ND) was a significant predictors (z = −0.73, p = .464). Also there were no significant effects of age (z = 1.09, p = .275) or sex (z = −0.49, p = .624).


Interestingly, dysphoria provided no advantage in the nonexpert conditions, suggesting that mood alone was not enough; there needed to be some knowledge behind it. This has interesting implications for the issue of expertise and religion. Perhaps dysphoria helps only the knowledgeable person conducting a ritual.

The manipulation check failed to show an effect of arousal! 

(affect grid) appears to have worked as intended, but only in
one dimension. Individuals in euphoric conditions did indicate higher scores in the happiness/sadness (horizontal) dimension than those in dysphoric conditions. However, this was not true for the arousal (vertical) dimension, suggesting that mood induction did not influence excitement level as strongly as it influenced the character of their moods

Another thing to note is that mean affect grid responses are generally in the middle of the scale (see Table 2). This is partly an artifact of how the sequence of ratings were averaged (see Russell {\&} Gobet, 2012), but also it could illustrate that our manipulations did not (and ethically, could not) provoke the extremes of emotion seen in real-life settings


One possibility is that our results are different because of methodological differences between the current study and that of Brand and Opwis (2007), the study that had most inspired us:

For example, they trained their participants in dyads. Participants were paired and then asked to figure out the three-disk TOH together until they had mastered the game. In contrast, our study simply gave participants a five-disk TOH (which is more difficult than the three-disk version) and left them to figure out the solution solo.

In other words, euphoria opens up your attention to the wider array of stimuli, whereas dysphoria restricts one's attention to the most salient details. In our study, it seems that the “narrowing of scope” of dysphoria was actually an advantage rather than a disadvantage, because it focused attention on the rules of the game.


Frederickson and Branigan (2005,
p. 314) ask: if “positive emotions do not share with negative emotion this hallmark feature of promoting and supporting specific action, then what good are they?” The answer, they write, is that positive affect is probably useful, but for much different purposes than that of dysphoria. Negative affect is useful for the “attack” and “flee” situations, whereas positive affect is about “play, explore, savour and integrate”


According to Levenson (1999, p. 497), the human emotional system (consisting of automatic core processes partially subject to voluntary control) is extremely useful in that it “helps us to engage in adaptive voluntary behaviors” (also see Bless et al., 1996; Wyer et al., 1999, {\S}3). Levenson (1999) further claims that negative emotions “are optimal for the short-term needs of actively dealing with threatening environmental challenges” (p. 492), whereas positive emotions have a “soothing function” (p. 494).

Asbeck, and Pagel (2003) claimed that positive mood facilitates “assimilative” tasks (where you need to think top-down, be creative and attend to a wide range of stimuli), while negative moods facilitate “accommodative” tasks (where one needs to think bottom-up, and attend closely to the most important stimuli for the task) (also see Feldman {\&} Kokinov, 2009; Feldman et al., 2010; Spering et al., 2005). 

Gable and Harmon-Jones (2010), whose experiment manipulated the motivational intensity of the task in the negative dimension, finding that low-intensity situations (e.g., sadness) created attentional broadening and high-intensity situations (e.g., disgust) caused attentional narrowing. This implies that intensity is a more important factor than valence.

In a competitive religious marketplace, only those traditions that maximize both the emotional appeal of rituals and the salience of authorized teachings while minimizing “tedium” are likely to thrive (Whitehouse, 2004).

Flash Bulb Memory (FBM):
Luminet and Curci (2009) found that the best models of FBM show a link between the importance and emotionality of the dysphoric event, which inevitably leads to mental rehearsal of the pertinent events – which ultimately leads to a vivid recollection difficult to forget

social identity was an important variable. For example, American participants processed their memories of the 9/11 terror attacks differently from European participants: American FBMs were also affected by the novelty and surprise of the event; whereas Europeans were affected, instead, by their attitudes toward the USA


The need to perform correctly should not be understated: dysphoric rituals play a crucial role in the formation of the essential personal self and can have major consequences for group alignment (Swann, Jetten, G{\'{o}}mez, Whitehouse, {\&} Bastian, 2012; Whitehouse {\&} Lanman, in press). The performance aspect of a dysphoric ritual thus has two sides: an expert semantic memory about the significance of the ritual (facilitated by dysphoria-induced SER and FBM) and an expert procedural memory},

@article{Yu2007,
abstract = {Following the theory of conceptual metaphor in cognitive linguistics, this paper studies a predominant conceptual metaphor in the understanding of the heart in ancient Chinese philosophy; THE HEART IS THE RULER OF THE BODY. The most important conceptual mapping of this metaphor consists in the perceived correspondence between the mental power of the heart and the political power of the ruler. The Chinese heart is traditionally regarded as the organ of thinking and reasoning, as well as feeling. As such, it is conceptualized as the central faculty of cognition. This cultural conceptualization differs fundamentally from the Western dualism that upholds the reason-emotion dichotomy, as represented by the binary contrast between mind and heart in particular, and mind and body in general. It is found that the HEART AS RULER metaphor has a mirror image, namely THE RULER IS THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY. The ruler as the "heart" of the country leads his nation while guided by his own heart as the "ruler" of his body. It is argued that the two-way metaphorical mappings are based on the overarching beliefs of ancient Chinese philosophy in the unity and correspondence between the microcosm of man and the macrocosm of universe. It is suggested that the conceptualization of the heart in ancient Chinese philosophy, which is basically metaphorical in nature, is still spread widely across Chinese culture today. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV.},

abstract = {This review examines the influence on heart rate variability (HRV) indices in athletes from training status, different types of exercise training, sex and ageing, presented from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The predictability of HRV in over-training, athletic condition and athletic performance is also included. Finally, some recommendations concerning the application of HRV methods in athletes are made.The cardiovascular system is mostly controlled by autonomic regulation through the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways of the autonomic nervous system. Analysis of HRV permits insight in this control mechanism. It can easily be determined from ECG recordings, resulting in time series (RR-intervals) that are usually analysed in time and frequency domains. As a first approach, it can be assumed that power in different frequency bands corresponds to activity of sympathetic (0.04-0.15 Hz) and parasympathetic (0.15-0.4 Hz) nerves. However, other mechanisms (and feedback loops) are also at work, especially in the low frequency band. During dynamic exercise, it is generally assumed that heart rate increases due to both a parasympathetic withdrawal and an augmented sympathetic activity. However, because some authors disagree with the former statement and the fact that during exercise there is also a technical problem related to the non-stationary signals, a critical look at interpretation of results is needed. It is strongly suggested that, when presenting reports on HRV studies related to exercise physiology in general or concerned with athletes, a detailed description should be provided on analysis methods, as well as concerning population, and training schedule, intensity and duration. Most studies concern relatively small numbers of study participants, diminishing the power of statistics. Therefore, multicentre studies would be preferable. In order to further develop this fascinating research field, we advocate prospective, randomised, controlled, long-term studies using validated measurement methods. Finally, there is a strong need for basic research on the nature of the control and regulating mechanism exerted by the autonomic nervous system on cardiovascular function in athletes, preferably with a multidisciplinary approach between cardiologists, exercise physiologists, pulmonary physiologists, coaches and biomedical engineers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Benefits of moderate endurance training include increases in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and a relative decrease in sympathetic tone. However, the effect of very intensive training load on neural cardiovascular regulation is not known. We tested the hypothesis that strenuous endurance training, like in high-performance athletes, would enhance sympathetic activation and reduce vagal inhibition. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the entire Italian junior national team of rowing (n=7) at increasing training loads up to 75{\%} and 100{\%} of maximum, the latter approximately 20 days before the Rowing World Championship. Autoregressive power spectral analysis was used to investigate RR interval and blood pressure (BP) variabilities. BRS was assessed by the sequences method. Increasing training load up to 75{\%} of maximum was associated with a progressive resting bradycardia and increased indexes of cardiac vagal modulation and BRS. However, at 100{\%} training load these effects were reversed, with increases in resting heart rate, diastolic BP, low-frequency RR interval, and BP variabilities and decreases in high-frequency RR variability and BRS. Three athletes later won medals in the World Championship. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that very intensive endurance training shifted the cardiovascular autonomic modulation from a parasympathetic toward a sympathetic predominance. This finding should be interpreted within the context of the substantial role played by the sympathetic nervous system in increasing cardiovascular performance at peak training. Whether the altered BP and autonomic function shown in this study might be in time hazardous to human cardiovascular system remains to be established.},

abstract = {Long-term endurance training significantly influences how the autonomic nervous system controls heart function. Endurance training increases parasympathetic activity and decreases sympathetic activity in the human heart at rest. These two training-induced autonomic effects, coupled with a possible reduction in intrinsic heart rate, decrease resting heart rate. Long-term endurance training also decreases submaximal exercise heart rate by reducing sympathetic activity to the heart. Physiological ageing is associated with a reduction in parasympathetic control of the heart; this decline in parasympathetic activity can be reduced by regular endurance exercise. Some research has indicated that females have increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic control of heart rate. These gender-specific autonomic differences probably contribute to a decreased cardiovascular risk and increased longevity observed in females.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim was to examine the cardiac autonomic responses to orthostatic stress and recovery from steady state exercise in endurance trained athletes and sedentary subjects. Methods: The power spectrum of heart rate variability was measured before and after exercise in 10 male long distance runners and 14 male sedentary control subjects. Both groups were comparable in sex, age, and body mass index. Continuous ECG recordings were obtained during the following physiological manoeuvres: 45 min supine rest state; 10 min standing; 15 min steady state exercise at 50{\%} maximum workload, and 15 min while supine during post-exercise recovery. The resting heart rate of athletes was lower than controls, at 52(SD 4.9) v 67(8.7) beats{\textperiodcentered}min−1, p{\&}lt;0.001. Power spectrum analysis was performed using autoregressive modelling. Results: The resting high frequency (HF) vagal component was higher in athletes than controls, at 62(10.7) v 44(22.4) beats{\textperiodcentered}min−1-Hz−1, p{\&}lt;0.05. The resting low frequency (LF) peak power was significantly reduced in athletes, at 54(9.9) v 70(19.5) in control, p{\&}lt;0.05. Although no group differences were observed during upright posture or exercise, the LF:HF area ratio had already returned to pre-exercise levels within 5 min of recovery in athletes. Conversely, it required up to 15 min of recovery before a noticeable decrease in the LF:HF area ratio was seen in controls. Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that endurance training modifies heart rate control in whole or in part through neurocardiac mechanisms.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Endurance training induces reductions in both resting and postexercise heart rate (HR). If adaptation in cardiac autonomic regulation is a contributing factor in these reductions, changes in cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) should correspond to those in HR during an endurance-training program. We investigated the changes in resting and postexercise HR variabilities (both in the time and frequency domain) over a 6-wk training program. METHODS: HR variability was measured five times in an endurance-training group (N = 7) and four times in a control group (N = 5) during the course of study. RESULTS: Endurance training decreased HR and increased indices of parasympathetic modulation measured both at rest and during postexercise recovery periods. Noteworthy is that no changes in either HR or indices of ANS modulation measured during postexercise recovery periods were detectable after the first 7 d of the study despite continued changes in resting HR and indices in ANS modulation measured between the 7th and 42nd days of the endurance-training program. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that with endurance-training changes in cardiac ANS modulation partly contribute to a decrease in HR at rest and during postexercise recovery period, and that adaptation of the cardiac autonomic control occurs sooner in immediate postexercise periods than at rest.},

portive contexts, Boyce and Ellis (2005) contended, it would be adaptive to be maximally influenced by the developmental envi- ronment. Indeed, the physical, behavioral, and psychological em- bodiment of the rich resource base provided by the family and the broader ecology would enhance the social competitiveness of the individual through the development of a broad range of compe- tencies, thereby increasing his or her mate value and eventual reproductive fitness

In contrast, those growing up under harsh and dangerous conditions would increase their chances of survival and eventual reproduction if they developed heightened vigilance to threat and proved highly prepared to actively combat risks that they might face.

heightened physiological reactivity is presumed to be the vehicle for getting this developmental job done.

Thus, it is Boyce and Ellis's thesis that the stress-response system operates as a conditional adaptation, selected to enable individuals to fit environments that, starting early in life, would enhance their fitness prospects: “Natural selection has favored developmental mechanisms (conditional adaptations) that function to adjust levels of BSC [biological sensitivity to context] to match familial and ecological conditions encountered early in life” (2005, p. 292).},

abstract = {The notion that some people are more vulnerable to adversity as a function of inherent risk characteristics is widely embraced in most fields of psychology. This is reflected in the popularity of the diathesis-stress framework, which has received a vast amount of empirical support over the years. Much less effort has been directed toward the investigation of endogenous factors associated with variability in response to positive influences. One reason for the failure to investigate individual differences in response to positive experiences as a function of endogenous factors may be the absence of adequate theoretical frameworks. According to the differential-susceptibility hypothesis, individuals generally vary in their developmental plasticity regardless of whether they are exposed to negative or positive influences--a notion derived from evolutionary reasoning. On the basis of this now well-supported proposition, we advance herein the new concept of vantage sensitivity, reflecting variation in response to exclusively positive experiences as a function of individual endogenous characteristics. After distinguishing vantage sensitivity from theoretically related concepts of differential-susceptibility and resilience, we review some recent empirical evidence for vantage sensitivity featuring behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors as moderators of a wide range of positive experiences ranging from family environment and psychotherapy to educational intervention. Thereafter, we discuss genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in vantage sensitivity, potential mechanisms underlying vantage sensitivity, and practical implications.},
annote = {The diathesis-stress framework presumes that some individuals are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of negative experiences and exposures than others due to some endogenous “vulnerability” characteristic (e.g., negative emotionality, “risk gene”).

this widely embraced framework has nothing to say about variation in response to putatively positive experiences. In fact, diathesis-stress reasoning suggests—at least implicitly— that there should be no differences between vulnerable and resil- ient individuals in the absence of adversity


individuals may be both highly responsive to environmental support (i.e., showing in- creased vantage sensitivity) and unresponsive to and protected from adversity (i.e., showing increased resilience), and this could be due to the very same endogenous characteristic.

vantage “bespeaks a position conferring advan- tage, benefit or gain, without bearing the singularity of a particular advantage.”

Manuck and associates (Manuck, 2011; Sweitzer etal., 2012) introduced the term Vantage Sensitivity to characterize the “bright side” of differential susceptibility and more generally variability in response to positive experiences. Vantage is short for advantage, but in addition to implying benefit, gain or profit, it is also defined as “a position, condition, or opportunity that is likely to provide superiority or an advantage” (Houghton Mifflin, 2000).


Vantage Sensitivity:
a) vantage sensitivity reflects the general proclivity of an individual to benefit from positive and presumptively well-being- and competence-promoting features of the environment, just as vulnerability depicts the tendency to succumb to negative effects of adversity in the diathesis-stress framework;

(b) the degree of vantage sensitivity is a function of the presence of vantage-sensitivity factors (i.e., promotive factors), just as vulnerability/risk factors increase vulnerability to negative effects of adversity in the diathesis-stress framework

c) vantage resistance describes the failure to benefit from positive influences, just as resilience characterizes resistance to negative effects of adversity in the diathesis-stress framework

(d) the degree of vantage resistance is a function of the presence of vantage- resistance factors or absence of vantage-sensitivity ones, just as protective factors increase resilience to negative effects of adver- sity in the diathesis-stress framework

In summary, vantage-sensitivity factors increase vantage sensitivity to the beneficial effects of positive experiences and exposures, whereas vantage- resistance factors diminish or even completely eliminate positive response to the same supportive conditions.},

In the Whitehall II study of civil servants aged 45-68 years (London, United Kingdom, 1997-1999), the strength of the association of moderate and vigorous activity with higher HRV was examined. Five-minute recordings of heart rate and HRV measures were obtained from 3328 participants. Calculated were time domain (standard deviation of NN intervals) and high-frequency-power measures as indicators of cardiac parasympathetic activity and low-frequency power of parasympathetic-sympathetic balance. Leisure-time physical activity (metabolic equivalent-hours per week) was categorized as moderate ({\textgreater}or=3-{\textless}5) and vigorous ({\textgreater}or=5). Moderate and vigorous physical activity were associated with higher HRV and lower heart rate.

abstract = {ABSTRACT—Conventional views suggest that exaggerated biological reactivity to stress is a harmful vestige of an evolutionary past in which threats to survival were more prevalent and severe. Recent evidence, however, indicates that effects of high reactivity on behavior and health are bivalent rather than univalent in character, exerting both risk-augmenting and risk-protective effects depending on the context. These observations suggest that heightened stress reactivity may reflect increased biological sensitivity to context, with potential for negative health effects under conditions of adversity and for positive effects under conditions of support. From an evolutionary perspective, the developmental plasticity of the stress-response systems, along with their structured, context-dependent effects, suggests that variation in these systems has been adaptively patterned to increase the capacity of children to match their stress-response profiles to anticipated developmental environments. Taken together, these theoretical perspectives generate a novel hypothesis: that there is a curvilinear, U-shaped relation between early exposures to adversity and the development of stress-reactive profiles, with high-reactivity phenotypes disproportionately emerging within both highly stressful and highly protected early social environments.},

However, recent theorizing has suggested that many biological and psychological processes can become maladaptive when they reach extreme levels. This raises the possibility that CVT might not have an unmitigated positive relationship with well-being. In line with this reasoning, across 231 adult participants (Mage = 40.02 years; 52{\%} female), we found that CVT was quadratically related to multiple measures of well-being, including life satisfaction and depressive symptoms. Individuals with moderate CVT had higher well-being than those with low or high CVT. These results provide the first direct evidence of a nonlinear relationship between CVT and well-being, adding to a growing body of research that has suggested some biological processes may cease being adaptive when they reach extreme levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that depending on the type of exercise performed, 2 different morphological forms of athlete's heart may be distinguished: a strength-trained heart and an endurance-trained heart. Individual studies have not tested this hypothesis satisfactorily. METHODS AND RESULTS: The hypothesis of divergent cardiac adaptations in endurance-trained and strength-trained athletes was tested by applying meta-analytical techniques with the assumption of a random study effects model incorporating all published echocardiographic data on structure and function of male athletes engaged in purely dynamic (running) or static (weight lifting, power lifting, bodybuilding, throwing, wrestling) sports and combined dynamic and static sports (cycling and rowing). The analysis encompassed 59 studies and 1451 athletes. The overall mean relative left ventricular wall thickness of control subjects (0.36 mm) was significantly smaller than that of endurance-trained athletes (0.39 mm, P=0.001), combined endurance- and strength-trained athletes (0.40 mm, P=0.001), or strength-trained athletes (0.44 mm, P{\textless}0.001). There was a significant difference between the 3 groups of athletes and control subjects with respect to left ventricular internal diameter (P{\textless}0. 001), posterior wall thickness (P{\textless}0.001), and interventricular septum thickness (P{\textless}0.001). In addition, endurance-trained athletes and strength-trained athletes differed significantly with respect to mean relative wall thickness (0.39 versus 0.44, P=0.006) and interventricular septum thickness (10.5 versus 11.8 mm, P=0.005) and showed a trend toward a difference with respect to posterior wall thickness (10.3 versus 11.0 mm, P=0.078) and left ventricular internal diameter (53.7 versus 52.1 mm, P=0.055). With respect to cardiac function, there were no significant differences between athletes and control subjects in left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and E/A ratio. CONCLSUIONS: Results of this meta-analysis regarding athlete's heart confirm the hypothesis of divergent cardiac adaptations in dynamic and static sports. Overall, athlete's heart demonstrated normal systolic and diastolic cardiac functions.},

Emerging data suggest that chronic training for and competing in extreme endurance events such as marathons, ultramarathons, ironman distance triathlons, and very long distance bicycle races, can cause transient acute volume overload of the atria and right ventricle, with transient reductions in right ventricular ejection fraction and elevations of cardiac biomarkers, all of which return to normal within 1 week. Over months to years of repetitive injury, this process, in some individuals, may lead to patchy myocardial fibrosis, particularly in the atria, interventricular septum, and right ventricle, creating a substrate for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, long-term excessive sustained exercise may be associated with coronary artery calcification, diastolic dysfunction, and large-artery wall stiffening. However, this concept is still hypothetical and there is some inconsistency in the reported findings. Furthermore, lifelong vigorous exercisers generally have low mortality rates and excellent functional capacity. Notwithstanding, the hypothesis that long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce adverse CV remodeling warrants further investigation to identify at-risk individuals and formulate physical fitness regimens for conferring optimal CV health and longevity. ?? 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.},

The aim of the two presented studies was to test the proposed association of cardiac vagal tone (CVT), assessed via resting high-frequency heart rate variability (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA), with coping, emotion-regulation, and social engagement in young adults. In Study 1 (retrospective self-report), RSA was positively associated with engagement coping (situation control, response control, positive self-instructions, social-support seeking) and aspects of social well-being. In Study 2 (ecological momentary assessment), for 28 days following the initial assessment, RSA predicted less use of disengagement strategies (acceptance and avoidance) for regulating negative emotions and more use of socially adaptive emotion-regulation strategies (i.e., social-support seeking as a reaction to sadness and making a concession as a reaction to anger caused by others). Furthermore, RSA was higher in participants who reported no anger episodes compared to those who reported at least one anger episode and was positively associated with reported episodes of negative emotions. Results support the association proposed by the PVT between CVT and self-regulatory behavior, which promotes social bonds. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this review, we integrate three evolutionary arguments that converge on the hypothesis that compassion evolved as a distinct affective experience whose primary function is to facilitate cooperation and protection of the weak and those who suffer. Our empirical review reveals compassion to have distinct appraisal processes attuned to undeserved suffering, distinct signaling behavior related to caregiving patterns of touch, posture, and vocalization, and a phenomenological experience and physiological response that orients the individual to social approach. This response profile of compassion differs from those of distress, sadness, and love, suggesting that compassion is indeed a distinct emotion. We conclude by considering how compassion shapes moral judgment and action, how it varies across different cultures, and how it may engage specific patterns of neural activation, as well as emerging directions of research.

annote = {respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which reflects the extent to which the vagus nerve exerts parasympathetic control over the heart rate (Berntson, Sarter,{\&}Cacioppo, 1998)—in numerous processes that are important for prosociality

individuals with higher vagal activity tend to show increased levels of positive emotions, social connection, and emotional expressivity and are better able to regulate their negative emotions in response to intense stressors—all processes important to prosociality 

These studies, we note, have not directly established linkages between cardiac vagal tone (CVT) and prosocial behavior but instead have investigated pro- cesses such as social connection that are likely involved in proso-cial behavior (Keltner et al., 2014).

These processes are important for prosocial behavior (e.g., remaining calm in the face of anoth- er's distress), but on their own do not constitute prosociality (e.g., one can be calm in the face of another's distress without moving to help them).

Thus, taken together, these studies suggest that vagal activity is likely associated with prosociality, though a direct empirical test of this hypothesis is needed

literature suggests that CVT may correlate with prosociality, but the relationship may not be a simple linear one. ex- tremely high levels of vagal activity are associated with mania (Gruber, Harvey, {\&} Purcell, 2011; Gruber, Johnson, Oveis, {\&} Keltner, 2008)

Vagal Activity and Its Correlation With Prosociality
First, activation of the vagus nerve decreases cardio-vascular arousal, promoting emotion regulation and calmness in response to distress (Butler et al., 2006; Fabes {\&} Eisenberg, 1997; Segerstrom {\&} Nes, 2007; van Kleef et al., 2008) This kind of emotion regulation allows individuals to overcome their own dis- tress and focus on the needs of others—core processes of proso-ciality.

Second, according to Porges' polyvagal theory (1995, 2001, 2007), the vagus nerve is a component of the human social engagement system. The vagus nerve is responsible for the regulation of the vocal cords and interacts with the neural regulation the eyes, ears, and select facial muscles involved in social com- munication and affiliation (Beauchaine, 2001; Porges, 2001).

we instead use the less interpretive term vagal activity because RSA can reflect both tonic and phasic vagal activity (see Berntson, Cacioppo, {\&} Grossman, 2007, for fuller discussion).

Vagal activity (RSA) predicts increased expressivity when being approached by strangers, more sociability, and fewer adjustment problems when entering preschool (Eisenberg et al., 1995; Fox {\&} Field, 1989; Stifter, Fox, {\&} Porges, 1989).

Higher vagal activity also predicts increases in positive emotions and connectedness to others over time; in turn, increases in positive emotions and social connectedness predict later increases in vagal activity, suggesting an upward spiral relationship (Kok {\&} Fredrickson, 2010)

higher resting levels of vagal activity levels to increased self- reports of traits tied to prosociality, such as extraversion and agreeableness, at 6–8 months after the vagal activity assessment (Oveis, Cohen, et al., 2009).


Linear relationship between vagal activity and prosociality? 
- individuals at risk for mania show elevated vagal activity in comparison to individuals not at risk (Gruber et al., 2008)
- among 6- to 8-year-old girls—who tend to show higher levels of vagal activity compared with boys—higher vagal activity levels predicted lower levels of peer and teacher ratings of sociability (Eisenberg et al., 1995, 1996)

- On the other end of this continuum, low vagal activity appears to correlate with several mental illnesses, including major depressive disorder (Dalack {\&} Roose, 1990), anxiety (Friedman {\&} Thayer, 1998), and posttraumatic stress disorder (Cohen, Kotler, Matar, {\&} Kaplan, 1997).

- Finally, the literature on vagal activity and depression is mixed; while some studies show that greater vagal activity predicts lower levels of depression (e.g., Rottenberg, Wilhelm, {\&} Gross, 2001), others yield the opposite pattern of results (Schultz, Anderson, {\&} van de Borne, 1997), and still other studies do not show any relationship at all (Rottenberg, 2007; Volkers et al., 2004)

Aristotle?
In writing about when emotions are functional and when they are not, Aristotle long ago advanced his principle of moder- ation: Emotions in moderate degrees, in the right context, and in response to the right people are functional with respect to the individual's well-being (cf. Grant {\&} Schwartz, 2011).

Recent work in the study of oxytocin has also begun to suggest that moderate levels of oxytocin are most optimal in promoting social cognition and functioning (Bartz, Zaki, Bolger,{\&} Ochsner, 2011).

Quadratic relationship: the "quadratic vagal activity–prosociality hypothesis"
We hold that vagus nerve activity is a core physiological correlate of prosociality, promoting greater compassion and care for others by modulating arousal (via regulation of the heart) and emotional expression (via vocalization)

Thus, we theorized that greater vagal activity at rest, as measured by RSA, would be reflective of greater prosociality. Yet very high levels of vagal activity may promote too much regulation of arousal and emo- tional expressivity, which can become maladaptive, reflecting a pattern of mania and indiscriminate affiliation. It may also be the case that extremely high levels of vagal activity compromise the cardiac vagal brake—the efficient withdrawal of vagal regulation of the heart in response to environmental challenges is critical to social engagement (Heilman et al., 2012)

What is prosociality?
Prosociality reflects a balance of other-focus, wherein the individual attends to the needs and concerns of others, and self-focus, wherein the individual experiences personal distress and considers the personal costs and benefits of particular courses of action (Goetz et al., 2010; Sober {\&} Wilson, 1998)

moderate vagal regulation, then, should allow for both the ability to empathize with an individual's pain and to regulate one's own distress to provide care to the person in need.

The Quick Detection of Traits From Thin Slices of Behavior:
Perhaps most impressive, people were able detect at better than chance levels whether an inmate gave a true or false confession statement from a 15-s video clip; participants who saw the full clips of the confessions (3 min long) actually per- formed worse than the participants who saw 15-s long clips and in fact did not perform better than chance (Albrechtsen, Meissner, {\&} Susa, 2009). Collectively, this body of work speaks to the human capacity for quick and accurate detection of numerous traits and internal states of strangers.

Study 1: 
Vagal Activity (RSA)
Prosociality
- Warm, Prosocial Relations With Others: three-item Relations subscale of the Psychological Well-Being Scales (Ryff, 1989), answering items such as “Peo- ple would describe me as a giving person, willing to share my time with others,” “I have not experienced many warm and trusting relationships with others,” and “Maintaining close re- lationships has been difficult and frustrating for me” on 1 (strongly disagree)to6(strongly agree) scales ( .70). The scale measures the degree to which individuals have warm, prosocial relations with others.

- Agreeableness: 10-item mea-
sure of agreeableness (Goldberg et al., 2006) from the Interna- tional Personality Item Pool, which captures enduring individual differences in prosocial personality. Sample items include “I sym- pathize with others' feelings,” and “I am interested in people,” and responses were captured on 1 (never true)to7(always true) scales (?? .91).

Results:
we found no evidence for a linear relationship between RSA and prosociality
vagal activity was quadratically associated with Warm, Prosocial Relations With Others and Agreeableness
These results demon- strate that as vagal activity increased, the relationship between vagal activity and prosociality progressively became more and more negative. Graphical inspection of the curves (see Figure 1) demonstrates an inverted U-shape curve.
Study

Study 2: It is of theoretical importance, however, to deter- mine whether these effects are simply a reflection of a positivity bias (in which case the quadratic pattern would be seen for all positive outcomes) or whether they are indeed specific to prosociality.

we expected to find a quadratic relationship only between vagal activity and prosocial positive emotions but not between vagal activity and general positivity.

Vagal Activity: RSA

Prosociality: 
- Prosocial and general positive emotions. Dispositional Positive Emotions Scales (Shiota, Keltner, {\&} John, 2006), a 44-item measure of the extent to which people experience several discrete positive emotions.
- We measured two prosocial positive emotions—compassion (seven items; ?? .77) and gratitude (two items; ?? .69)—and five general positive control emotions—including joy (seven items）， contentment (seven items; ?? .88), desire (seven items; ?? .72), amusement (seven items; ?? .66), and interest (seven items; ?? .71). We measured all items using 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scales.

Results:
- no linear relationship
- we found a quadratic relationship between vagal activity and the two prosocial positive emotions: compassion, and gratitude (see Figure 2). In contrast, we did not find evidence for a quadratic relationship between vagal activity and any of the general positive emotions: contentment, joy, desire, amusement, and interest. These results support our prediction that there should only be a quadratic rela- tionship between vagal activity and prosocial positive emotions; in fact, we found no relationship between vagal activity and non- prosocial positive emotions, linear or quadratic.


In Study 3, we examined the inter-personal consequences of the link between vagal activity and prosociality by having na{\"{i}}ve observers rate the prosociality of targets across the range of vagal activity values based on thin slices of behavior—silenced 20-s long video clips depicting the targets responding to the suffering of their romantic partner

selected a group of targets with known levels of vagal activity (RSA) from a previous study in which participants took turns discussing a time of personal suffering; this paradigm has been shown to reliably elicit compassion in participants 

After watching each video clip, partic- ipants rated each target for how “trustworthy,” “compassionate,” and “kind” they perceived them to be on scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)to7(strongly agree).

Results: Supporting our hypothesis, there was a quadratic link between target vagal activity and perceived prosociality (see Table 3 and Figure 3)

Discussion:
empirical work have implicated vagal activity in predicting numerous psychological processes involved in prosocial behavior, including including emotion regulation (Butler et al., 2006), positive emotions (Kok {\&} Fredrickson, 2010; Oveis, Co- hen, et al., 2009), and sociability (Eisenberg et al., 1996).

some studies have shown that elevated vagal activity is also predictive of negative outcomes, such as the mania component of bipolar dis- order (Gruber et al., 2008) and lowered sociability among adoles- cent girls (Eisenberg et al., 1995, 1996).

overcome one's own negative emotions to respond in a kind, compassionate manner. In contrast, we reasoned that having low or very high vagal activity would result in lower levels of prosociality. moderate vagal activity presents a balancing between necessary arousal to experience empathy for another's suffering and the

one interpretation of our results could view vagal activity as a biological substrate of prosociality; however, it is important to note that our work (and previous related work) is correlational in nature, and thus future experimental evidence is necessary before making a true causal claim

people's prosocial dispositions are shaped by other biological individual differences tied to oxytocin (Bartz et al., 2011; Kogan et al., 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2009), dopamine (Harbaugh et al., 2007), and serotonin (Crockett et al., 2013; Crockett, Clark, Hauser, {\&} Rob- bins, 2010).

people's prosocial dispositions are shaped by other biological individual differences tied to oxytocin (Bartz et al., 2011; Kogan et al., 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2009), dopamine (Harbaugh et al., 2007), and serotonin (Crockett et al., 2013; Crockett, Clark, Hauser, {\&} Rob- bins, 2010).

our data are therefore consis- tent with the predictions of the hypothesis but do not offer the evidence necessary to make a strong empirical claim that vagal activity promotes prosociality in a quadratic manner. Thus, one important future direction in this work is to experimentally manipulate vagal activity at different starting levels to observe the consequences.

vagal activity for individuals who in general have low vagal activity levels will be beneficial and result in elevated prosociality; in contrast, we also predict that increasing vagal activity for individuals who begin with moderate vagal activity may reduce prosociality

Cross-cultural validity? 
Given the different cultural norms for emotional expression and connection to others (Markus {\&} Kitayama, 1991), it should not be assumed that the correlations of vagal activity to prosociality will be the same in Eastern cultures. Indeed, some evidence suggests that even biological correlates of sociability can have different predictive patterns in Eastern cultures compared with Western cultures (e.g., Kim et al., 2011) however, others have found parallel results (Wang et al., 2013).

To examine sensitivity to cultural norms regarding emotion regulation, we explored the expression of the oxytocin receptor polymorphism (OXTR) rs53576, a gene previously related to socioemotional sensitivity, in conjunction with cultural norms. Emotional suppression is normative in East Asian cultures but not in American culture. Consequently, we predicted an interaction of Culture and OXTR in emotional suppression. Korean and American participants completed assessments of emotion regulation and were genotyped for OXTR. We found the predicted interaction: Among Americans, those with the GG genotype reported using emotional suppression less than those with the AA genotype, whereas Koreans showed the opposite pattern. These findings suggest that OXTR rs53576 is sensitive to input from cultural norms regarding emotion regulation. These findings also indicate that culture is a moderator that shapes behavioral outcomes associated with OXTR genotypes.},

This phenomenon, termed 'social buffering', has been found in rodents, birds, non-human primates and also in humans. This paper reviews classical findings on social buffering and focuses, in particular, on social buffering effects in relation to neuroendocrine stress responses. The social cues that transmit social buffering signals, the neural mechanisms of social buffering and a partner's efficacy with respect to social buffering are also detailed. Social contact appears to have a very positive influence on the psychological and the physiological aspects of social animals, including human beings. Research leading towards further understanding of the mechanisms of social buffering could provide alternative medical treatments based on the natural, individual characteristics of social animals, which could improve the quality of life.},

Ten healthy untrained men trained for 8 weeks using a cycle ergometer [70{\%} of initial maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) for 1 h, 3-4 days.week-1] and then did not exercise for the next 4 weeks. Post-exercise vagal reactivation was evaluated as the time constant of the beat-by-beat decrease in heart rate during the 30 s (t30) immediately following 4 min exercise at 80{\%} of ventilatory threshold (VT). The VO2max and the oxygen uptake at VT had significantly increased after the 8 weeks training programme (P {\textless} 0.0001, P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). The t30 had shortened after training, and values after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of training were significantly shorter than the initial t30 (P {\textless} 0.05, P {\textless} 0.01, respectively). The change in the t30 after 8 weeks of training closely and inversely correlated with the initial t30 (r = -0.965, P {\textless} 0.0001). The reduced t30 was prolonged significantly after 2 weeks of detraining, and had returned almost to the baseline level after a further 2 weeks of detraining.

abstract = {In the last decade, cardiac vagal tone has emerged as a psychophysiological marker of many aspects of behavioral functioning in both children and adults. Research efforts during this time have produced an extensive list of vagal tone correlates that includes temperamental variables as well as both anxious/internalizing and disruptive/externalizing behaviors. This potentially confusing state of affairs is compounded by developmental shifts in vagal tone behavior relations that to date have not been elucidated. In this paper, the vagal tone literature is reviewed, and discrepancies, including the lack of specificity of vagal tone as a psychophysiological marker, are clarified. Such clarification requires that we (a) view vagal tone-behavior relations in developmental context, (b) juxtapose vagal tone-behavior relations in typical and atypical samples, and (c) consider the parasympathetic underpinnings of vagal tone as but one component in a broader model of autonomic nervous system functioning. Such a model is provided by combining Gray's motivational theory with Porges's polyvagal theory. Together these models account for behavioral and emotional differences in a diverse range of psychological disorders that are not differentiated by either model alone. Moreover, use of the integrated model offers a theory-driven approach to the study of autonomic nervous system-behavior relations.},

abstract = {Vagal tone (VT), an index of autonomic flexibility, is linked to social and psychological well-being. We posit that the association between VT and well-being reflects an " upward spiral" in which autonomic flexibility, represented by VT, facilitates capitalizing on social and emotional opportunities and the resulting opportunistic gains, in turn, lead to higher VT. Community-dwelling adults were asked to monitor and report their positive emotions and the degree to which they felt socially connected each day for 9 weeks. VT was measured at the beginning and end of the 9-week period. Adults who possessed higher initial levels of VT increased in connectedness and positive emotions more rapidly than others. Furthermore, increases in connectedness and positive emotions predicted increases in VT, independent of initial VT level. This evidence is consistent with an " upward spiral" relationship of reciprocal causality, in which VT and psychosocial well-being reciprocally and prospectively predict one another. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Several evolutionary frameworks model the conditions under which prosocial behavior is evolutionarily viable, yet no unifying treatment exists of the psychological decision-making processes that result in prosociality. Here, we provide such a perspective in the form of the sociocultural appraisals, values, and emotions (SAVE) framework of prosociality. We review evidence for the components of our framework at four levels of analysis: intrapsychic, dyadic, group, and cultural. Within these levels, we consider how phenomena such as altruistic punishment, prosocial contagion, self-other similarity, and numerous others give rise to prosocial behavior. We then extend our reasoning to chart the biological underpinnings of prosociality and apply our framework to understand the role of social class in prosociality.},

It remains unknown whether a specific genetic polymorphism may influence the association between cultural traits and neural activity in the social brain network. We tested whether the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) affects the association between self-construals and neural activity involved in reflection of personal attributes of oneself and a significant other. Using functional MRI, we scanned Chinese adults with short/short (s/s) or long/long (l/l) variants of the 5-HTTLPR during reflection of personal attributes of oneself and one's mother. We found that, while s/s and l/l genotype groups did not differ significantly in self-construals measured by the Self-Construal Scale, the relationship between self-construal scores and neural responses to reflection of oneself and mother was significantly different between the two genotype groups. Specifically, l/l but not s/s genotype group showed significant association between self-construal scores and activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral middle frontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, insula, and hippocampus during reflection on mental attributes of oneself and mother. Our findings suggest that a specific genetic polymorphism may interact with a cultural trait to shape the neural substrates underlying social cognition.},

abstract = {High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes. Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential susceptibility theories as well as for the prevention and treatment of depression are discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

annote = {dynamic modulation of cardiac vagal control—as an individual-level physiological index of social sensitivity

individuals with greater cardiac vagal flexibility, operationalized as higher cardiac vagal tone at rest and greater cardiac vagal withdrawal (indexed by a decrease in RSA) during cognitive or attentional demand i perceive social-emotional information more accurately and show greater sensitivity to their social context


Study 1 
sets the foundation for this investigation by establishing that vagal flexibility can be elicited consistently in the laboratory and reliably over time

RSA baseline, and then:
We used a variety of cognitive tasks across the three visits to ensure novelty and thus to avoid
habituation effects. All tasks posed some degree of mental challenge and were grouped into three sets lasting 5 minutes each, which were counterbalanced across the three study visits.

Results:



Study 2 
demonstrates that vagal flexibility has different associations with psychological characteristics than vagal tone, and that these characteristics are primarily social in nature

We employed a visual tracking task to engender attentional demands and calculated vagal flexibility as the difference between vagal activation during a resting state and vagal activation during the visual tracking task. 

Before completing this task in the lab, participants provided self-report ratings of perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness.We hypothesized that vagal tone and vagal flexibility would show distinct associations with these psychosocial measures

Results:
Vagal tone was significantly negatively correlated with perceived stress (PSS total score), pr(72)= ?.26, p{\textless}.03, and depression (CESD total score), pr(72)= ?.25, p{\textless}.03, and marginally correlated with anxiety, pr(72)= ?.22, p{\textless}.06 (BAI total score), controlling for age, gender, and BMI; that is, consistent with previous findings, individuals with higher vagal tone reported lower levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. 

vagal tone was not significantly correlated with self-reported loneliness (UCLA-L total score), p{\textgreater}.13.

Only the correlation between vagal flexibility and loneliness was significant, pr(68)= ?.25, p=.035, all other prs{\textless}.13, ps{\textgreater}.30.We then compared the correlation of vagal flexibility and loneliness with vagal flexibility and the other psychosocial variables and observed a minimum statistical difference, z = 2.30, p =.022. In sum, vagal flexibility was only significantly correlated with loneliness and this correlation was significantly different than the correlations between vagal flexibility and the other psychosocial variables

Study 2 demonstrated that a mental challenge involving simple attentional demand is capable of
eliciting decreases in RSA from baseline. Moreover, individual differences in the magnitude of this withdrawal (i.e., vagal flexibility) provide unique information about psychosocial variables beyond that provided by vagal tone

finding appears to suggest, albeit indirectly, that individuals with greater vagal flexibility might have a greater capacity to “tune in” to their social world and engage with others




Study 3 
links individual differences in vagal flexibility with accurate detection of social and emotional cues depicted in still facial images. Specifically, we examined the association between individual differences in vagal flexibility and social-emotional perception—the ability to accurately perceive subtle social and emotional cues. 

Participants then completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Raste, {\&} Plumb, 2001), which required them to view a series of photos of people's eye area and to choose a response that best describes how the person in each photo is thinking or feeling

Results: 
vagal flexibility on social-emotional accuracy, we controlled for intelligence (total scores on the WAIS verbal subtest) as well as attentional capacity on the visual attention task, also other common controls namely, age, gender, and BMI.

Our primary regression analysis predicted social-emotional perception accuracy from vagal
flexibility, controlling for the aforementioned covariates (see Table 2). when vagal flexibility was added in Step 2 of the model, it produced a significant change in R2, F(1,95) = 4.37, p =.04: the greater the vagal flexibility, the greater the accuracy on the RMET

Study 3 demonstrated that individual differences in vagal flexibility are related to social-
emotional accuracy beyond verbal intelligence and attentional capacity. These initial data support the idea that individuals with greater vagal flexibility might be especially sensitive to subtle social and emotional cues in their environment, as indicated by their increased accuracy in detecting non-verbal expressions with limited information (i.e., context-free still images of the eye area only)

Importantly, vagal tone (i.e., resting RSA) was unrelated to performance on the RMET, providing evidence that flexibility of vagus nerve activity is more closely linked to social and emotional perception than is resting activation level (cf. Hopp et al., 2013; Park et al., 2012) Given

Study 4
demonstrates that individuals with greater vagal flexibility respond to dynamic social feedback in a more context-sensitive manner than do individuals with less vagal flexibility

greater vagal flexibility would be beneficial when the social environment was positive and accepting, but detrimental when the social environment signaled negativity and rejection

Specifically, compared to their less flexible counterparts, individuals with greater vagal flexibility, when assigned to receive negative social feedback, report more shame, show more pronounced stress responses, and display less sociable behavior, but when receiving positive social feedback display more sociable behavior

hypothesized that vagal reactivity would be related to more sensitive emotional responding, and specifically, to shame—a self-conscious emotion that relates to people's awareness of others' reactions to, and evaluations of, them. Participants also completed a resources and demands questionnaire before and after the speech task to assess their appraisals of the situation (Mendes, Gray, Mendoza-Denton, Major, {\&} Epel, 2007). It

Results:
ANCOVA controlling for baseline positive emotion revealed a significant effect of social feedback on positive emotions after the speech task:

there was a significant difference in the threat ratio (calculated as demands divided by resources) between participants in the two feedback conditions: F(1, 66) =9.37, p = .01. Participants who received positive feedback reported smaller threat ratios,M = 0.96, SD = .29, than did those who received negative feedback, M = 1.23, SD = .41. Vagal

The vagal flexibility by social feedback condition interaction in Step 2 was significant, t(52) = 2.90, p =.006. Among participants receiving positive social feedback, greater vagal flexibility was associated with lower blood pressure reactivity, b = ?.29, p = .138, though not significantly so; by contrast, participants receiving negative social feedback showed the opposite pattern: greater RSA flexibility was associated with higher blood pressure reactivity, b = .46, p =.015

we observed a significant main effect of feedback condition on observed sociable behavior, t(52) = -4.66, p {\textless} .001.

we again found that participants with greater vagal flexibility showed greater social sensitivity, as indexed by their awareness of, and affective, physiological, and behavioral responsiveness to, the dynamic social feedback cues

Specifically, among individuals assigned to receive negative social feedback, greater vagal flexibility was associated with more shame, greater increases in blood pressure, and less sociable behavior. By contrast, among those assigned to receive positive social feedback, greater vagal flexibility was associated with more sociable behavior toward the evaluators. These results support the idea that vagal flexibility is related to greater social sensitivity and responsiveness to static and dynamic affective contexts.


Introduction:
healthy physiological responding involves the interaction of multiple control mechanisms that allow individuals to adapt to unpredictable changes and exigencies in their environment (Lipsitz {\&} Goldberger, 1992)

Evolution of individual variation: individuals are also likely to differ in the degree of sensitivity with which their physiology adjusts to the vicissitudes of daily life. 

- Belsky and colleagues (Belsky et al., 2009; Belsky {\&} Pluess, 2009) have argued that from a fitness-optimizing standpoint, nature would have likely selected for variation in individuals' plasticity or susceptibility to the influence of their social environment, with some people being less malleable—and more robust—across conditions, and others showing greater vulnerability to adverse conditions on the one hand, and a greater tendency to thrive in supportive or at least benign conditions on the other (Belsky {\&} Pluess, 2009; Pluess {\&} Belsky, 2012).

evidence that individuals with greater trait-level frontal cortical asymmetry (greater activation in the left prefrontal cortex relative to the right) are more buffered against social rejection (Harmon-Jones {\&} Allen, 1998; Koslov, Mendes, Pajtas, {\&} Pizzagalli, 2011).

Neuroendocrinology studies of young adults with lower baseline levels of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) show heightened vulnerability to experiencing negative affect in the context of threatening social situations involving social rejection (Akinola {\&} Mendes, 2008).

A study of young children found those with high cortisol reactivity to be more prosocial under low adversity conditions, but less prosocial under high adversity conditions compared to children with low cortisol reactivity (Obradovi{\'{c}}, Bush, Stamperdahl, Adler, {\&} Boyce, 2010)

(2) provides unique and socially specific information beyond that provided by vagal tone, a more commonly used individual difference index of emotion and well-being; 
(3) predicts more accurate detection of social-emotional cues in still facial images; and 
(4) predicts greater awareness of, and more sensitive affective, behavioral, and physiological responding to social cues during a dynamic interpersonal interaction

Vagal Regulation of the Heart and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia:
The myelinated vagus promotes effective social communication by inhibiting sympathetic
influences on the heart and promoting a state of calm. 

Due to this inhibitory influence of the vagus, the resting heart rate of a healthy adult (60-80 bpm) is typically much lower than the intrinsic rate of the cardiac pacemaker ({\~{}}100-150 beats per minute; Porges, 2003)

RSA: 
Respiration acts as a gate through which vagal control of the heart is admitted during exhalation and obstructed during inhalation, leading to a characteristic variation in the heart's rhythm when an individual is at rest: a slowing of heart rate during exhalation and a speeding during inhalation

This variability in heart rate, which occurs in the frequency band of human respiration (.12 to .40 Hz), is indexed by RSA. Higher RSA reflects greater myelinated vagal control of the heart, which in turn, suggests greater parasympathetic nervous system influence on the heart.

demand-related withdrawal of the vagus nerve can produce a change from the situation of higher covariance between heart rate and respiration rate observed at rest to one of lower covariance, manifesting as a decrease in RSA

This would seem to suggest that dynamic modulation of vagal control of the heart in response to shifts in the environment would be a particularly useful index for assessing the flexibility and context- appropriateness (i.e., sensitivity) of individuals' responses to their social world

Thus, the rapid application and withdrawal of vagal inhibition is viewed as an adaptive substrate for flexible behavioral routines (Friedman, 2007; Rottenberg, Salomon, Gross, {\&} Gotlib, 2005)

Given the importance of such dynamic responding, then, it is surprising that the majority of studies examining the association between vagus nerve activity and social cue sensitivity have focused on vagal tone—the basal influence of the vagus nerve on the heart. Although higher vagal tone can indicate a soothed or calm state, which is certainly adaptive at rest, rigid maintenance of either high or low RSA is less adaptive.

For example, under conditions that pose greater metabolic demand on the individual (e.g., increased attention and information processing, exercise, coping with negative emotion, and threats to life and limb), vagal withdrawal is more likely to facilitate successful responding

tasks requiring increased cognitive effort or attentional control elicit reliable vagal withdrawal, or decreases in RSA from baseline (B{\"{o}}hm, R{\"{o}}tting, Schwenk, Grebe, {\&} Mansmann, 2001; Porges, 1980; Van Roon, Mulder, Althaus, {\&} Mulder, 2004; Van Roon, Mulder, Veldman, {\&} Mulder, 1995;Walter {\&} Porges, 1976).

Critically, the magnitude of the RSA decrease in response to tasks posing attentional and cognitive demands is associated with better task performance (Akinola {\&} Mendes, 2014; Duschek, Muckenthaler, Werner, {\&} Reyes del Paso, 2009; Kassam, Koslov, {\&} Mendes, 2009;Mathewson et al., 2010;Morgan, Aikins, Steffian, Coric, {\&} Southwick, 2007).

Obradovi{\'{c}} and colleagues (2010) showed that children with high RSA reactivity (i.e., greater vagal withdrawal) in response to cognitive, social, emotional, and sensory challenge tasks demonstrated greater pro-sociality and school engagement under low-adversity conditions, but less pro-sociality and school engagement under high-adversity conditions than did children with low RSA reactivity (Obradovi{\'{c}} et al., 2010).

adolescents who responded with greater RSA decreases during a mental stressor showed greater increases in behavioral warmth toward their parent two years later (Diamond {\&} Cribbet, 2013)

Schmitz and colleagues showed that children with social phobia, a psychiatric disorder characterized by a persistent and context-insensitive fear of social situations, exhibited restricted RSA reactivity in response to a stressful speech task (Schmitz, Kramer, Tuschen-Caffier, Heinrichs, {\&} Blechert, 2011)

Rottenberg and colleagues found that depressed individuals who showed greater RSA reactivity (i.e., withdrawal) in response to a sad film showed better recovery from depression 6 months later than did their counterparts with low RSA reactivity, controlling for medication use and baseline depressive symptoms (Rottenberg et al., 2005).


Discussion:
Consistent with our predictions, we found that in the context of social rejection cues, individuals with greater vagal flexibility responded with greater negative responses, including subjective states, hemodynamic changes, and observable behavior

perceiving cues of social acceptance, greater vagal flexibility translated into more observable social behavior and a trend toward lower blood pressure reactivity

Importantly, the strong association we repeatedly found between vagal flexibility and social sensitivity was never obtained for the more commonly used vagal tone measure, suggesting that it may be profitable for researchers interested in the biobehavioral processes underlying social sensitivity to begin including more dynamic measures of vagal functioning.

Strengths {\&} Limitations: 
- No systematic distinguishing of the social from global perceptual acuity and responsiveness

our data stop short of uncovering the causal nature of vagal influences on social engagement processes. This type of work would only be possible by directly manipulating vagal responses—either through pharmaceutical blockade via the cholinergic blocker atropine or by vagal nerve stimulation—and then testing the resultant effects on social sensitivity},

abstract = {The polyvagal theory describes an autonomic nervous system that is influenced by the central nervous system, sensitive to afferent influences, characterized by an adaptive reactivity dependent on the phylogeny of the neural circuits, and interactive with source nuclei in the brainstem regulating the striated muscles of the face and head. The theory is dependent on accumulated knowledge describing the phylogenetic transitions in the vertebrate autonomic nervous system. Its specific focus is on the phylogenetic shift between reptiles and mammals that resulted in specific changes to the vagal pathways regulating the heart. As the source nuclei of the primary vagal efferent pathways regulating the heart shifted from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in reptiles to the nucleus ambiguus in mammals, a face-heart connection evolved with emergent properties of a social engagement system that would enable social interactions to regulate visceral state.},
annote = {The polyvagal theory proposes that the evolution of the mammalian autonomic nervous system provides the neurophysiological substrates for adaptive behavioral strategies.

It further proposes that physiological state limits the range of behavior and psychological experience.

The theory links the evolution of the autonomic nervous system to affective experience, emotional expression, facial gestures, vocal communication, and contingent social behavior

respiratory sinus arrhythmia has a neural origin and represents the tonic functional outflow from the vagus to the heart (ie, cardiac vagal tone)


Functionally, when the environment is perceived as safe, two important features are expressed. First, bodily state is regulated in an efficient manner to promote growth and restoration (eg, visceral homeostasis).

This is done through an increase in the influence of mammalian myelinated vagal motor pathways on the cardiac pacemaker that slows the heart, inhibits the fight–flight mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system, dampens the stress response system of the HPA axis (eg, cortisol), and reduces inflammation by modulating immune reactions (eg, cyto kines).

the myelinated vagus became integrated with the nuclei that regulate the muscles of the face and head. This link results in the bidirectional coupling between spontaneous social engagement behaviors and bodily states.

Specifically, an integrated social engagement system emerged in mammals when the neural regulation of visceral states that promote growth and restoration (via the myelinated vagus) was linked neuroanatomically and neurophysiologically with the neural regulation of the muscles controlling eye gaze, facial expression, listening, and prosody

the human nervous system retained two more primitive neural circuits to regulate defensive strategies (ie, fight–flight and death-feigning behaviors). It is important to note that social behavior, social communication, and visceral homeostasis are incompatible with the neurophysiological states and behaviors promoted by the two neural circuits that support defense strategies

Thus, via evolution, the human nervous system retains three neural circuits, which are in a phylogenetically organized hierarchy. In this hierarchy of adaptive responses, the newest circuit is used first; if that circuit fails to provide safety, the older circuits are recruited sequentially.

1. There is a phylogenetic shift in the regulation of the heart from endocrine communication to unmyelinated nerves and finally to myelinated nerves

2. There is a development of opposing neural mechanisms of excitation and inhibition to provide rapid regulation of graded metabolic output.

3. A face–heart connection evolved as source nuclei of vagal pathways shifted ventrally from the older dorsal motor nucleus to the nucleus ambiguus. This resulted in an anatomical and neurophysiological linkage between neural regulation of the heart via the myelinated vagus and the special visceral efferent pathways that regulate the striated muscles of the face and head, forming an integrated social engagement system (Figure 1; for more details, see Porges7,15).

With increased cortical development, the cortex exhibits greater control over the brainstem via direct (eg, corticobulbar) and indirect (eg, corticoreticular) neural pathways originating in motor cortex and terminating in the source nuclei of the myelinated motor nerves emerging from the brainstem (eg, specifi c neuralpathways embedded within cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XI), controlling visceromotor structures (ie, heart, bronchi) as well as somatomotor structures (muscles of the face and head).

NEUROCEPTION: CONTEXTUAL CUEING OF ADAPTIVE, MALADAPTIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES

To effectively switch from defensive to social engagement strategies, the mammalian nervous system needs to perform two important adaptive tasks: (1) assess risk, and (2) if the environment is perceived as safe, inhibit the more primitive limbic structures that control fight, flight, or freeze behaviors.

Any stimulus that has the potential for increasing an organism's experience of safety has the potential of recruiting the evolutionarily more advanced neural circuits that support the prosocial behaviors of the social engagement system

The nervous system, through the processing of sensory information from the environment and from the viscera, continuously evaluates risk. 

Since the neural evaluation of risk does not require conscious awareness and may involve subcortical limbic structures, the term neuroception was introduced to emphasize a neural process, distinct from perception, that is capable of distinguishing environmental (and visceral) features that are safe, dangerous, or life-threatening

In safe environments, autonomic state is adaptively regulated to dampen sympathetic activation and to protect the oxygen-dependent central nervous system, especially the cortex, from the metabolically conservative reactions of the dorsal vagal complex.

Environmental components of neuroception:
Neuroception is proposed as a plausible mechanism mediating both the expression and the disruption of positive social behavior, emotion regulation, and visceral homeostasis

Neuroception might be triggered by feature detectors involving areas of temporal cortex that communicate with the central nucleus of the amygdala and the periaqueductal gray, since limbic reactivity is modulated by temporal cortex responses to the intention of voices, faces, and hand movements

Thus, the neuroception of familiar individuals and individuals with appropriately prosodic voices and warm, expressive faces translates into a social interaction promoting a sense of safety.

the nervous system evaluates risk and matches neurophysiological state with the actual risk of the environment

When the environment is appraised as being safe, the defensive limbic structures are inhibited, enabling social engagement and calm visceral states to emerge.

In contrast, some individuals experience a mismatch and the nervous system appraises the environment as being dangerous even when it is safe. This mismatch results in physiological states that support fight, flight, or freeze behaviors, but not social engagement behaviors

According to the theory, social communication can be expressed efficiently through the social engagement system only when these defensive circuits are inhibited

Afferent feedback from the viscera provides a major mediator of the accessibility of prosocial circuits associated with social engagement behaviors

that states of mobilization would compromise our ability to detect positive social cues

Functionally, visceral states color our perception of objects and others. Thus, the same features of one person engaging another may result in a range of outcomes, depending on the physiological state of the target individual. If the person being engaged is in a state in which the social engagement system is easily accessible, the reciprocal prosocial interactions are likely to occur

The insula may be involved in the mediation of neuroception, since it has been proposed as a brain structure involved in conveying the diffuse feedback from the viscera into cognitive awareness.

Critchley proposes that internal body states are represented in the insula and contribute to states of subjective feeling, and he has demonstrated that activity in the insula correlates with interoceptive accuracy.

the theory provides a plausible explanation for the reported covariation between atypical autonomic regulation (eg, reduced vagal and increased sympathetic influences to the heart) and psychiatric and behavioral disorders that involve difficulties in regulating appropriate social, emotional, and communication behaviors

For example, a physiological state characterized by a vagal withdrawal would support the mobilization behaviors of fight and flight

In contrast, a physiological state characterized by increased vagal influence on the heart (via myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus) would support spontaneous social engagement behaviors.

Second, the theory emphasizes the formation of an integrated social engagement system through functional and structural links between neural control of the striated muscles of the face and the smooth muscles of the viscera.

Third, the polyvagal theory proposes a mechanism—neuroception—to trigger or to inhibit defense strategies},

abstract = {Prominent neuroscience models suggest that addictive behavior occurs when environmental stressors and drug-relevant cues activate a cycle of cognitive, affective, and psychophysiological mechanisms, including dysregulated interactions between bottom-up and top-down neural processes, that compel the user to seek out and use drugs. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) target pathogenic mechanisms of the risk chain linking stress and addiction. This review describes how MBIs may target neurocognitive mechanisms of addiction at the attention-appraisal-emotion interface. Empirical evidence is presented suggesting that MBIs ameliorate addiction by enhancing cognitive regulation of a number of key processes, including: clarifying cognitive appraisal and modulating negative emotions to reduce perseverative cognition and emotional arousal; enhancing metacognitive awareness to regulate drug-use action schema and decrease addiction attentional bias; promoting extinction learning to uncouple drug-use triggers from conditioned appetitive responses; reducing cue-reactivity and increasing cognitive control over craving; attenuating physiological stress reactivity through parasympathetic activation; and increasing savoring to restore natural reward processing. Treatment and research implications of our neurocognitive framework are presented. We conclude by offering a temporally sequenced description of neurocognitive processes targeted by MBIs through a hypothetical case study. Our neurocognitive framework has implications for the optimization of addiction treatment with MBIs.},

On the basis of the approach/inhibition theory of power (Keltner, Gruenfeld, {\&} Anderson, 2003), we hypothesized that elevated social power is associated with diminished reciprocal emotional responses to another person's suffering (feeling distress at another person's distress) and with diminished complementary emotion (e.g., compassion).

annote = {high power, less distress (reciprocity), less compassion (complimentarity), and more buffering of autonomic response (RSA activity).

emotional reactions to increases in talkers' distress were buffered by autonomic emotion regulation in high-power listeners, but not in low-power listeners



hypothesized that elevated social power is associated with diminished reciprocal emotional responses to another person's suffering (feeling distress at another person's distress) and with diminished complementary emotion (e.g., compassion). In face-to-face conversations, participants disclosed experiences that had caused them suffering [shared autobiographical experiences]. As predicted, participants with a higher sense of power experienced less distress and less compassion and exhibited greater autonomic emotion regulation when confronted with another participant's suffering


The fact that cultures have evolved a norm of noblesse oblige— that individuals with power and wealth should behave gener- ously toward individuals with low power—suggests that power dampens the propensity to care for other people.

how power influences reciprocal and complementary emotional reactions to the suffering of another person (Batson, Fultz, {\&} Schoenrade, 1987; Keltner {\&} Kring, 1998)

Emotional reciprocity refers to the process by which one individual comes to feel the emotions of anotheras when one person's distress arouses distress in another. 

Emotional complementarity occurs when one person's emotions evoke different but corresponding emotions in others, as when one person's distress arouses compassion in another.

The emotional reciprocity between parent and child helps coordinate their goal-directed behaviors prior to the child's acquisition of language (Campos, Campos, {\&} Barrett, 1989).

In adults, brief exposure to another person's emotions automatically triggers similar emotions (Hess {\&} Blairy, 2001).

The emotional reactions of friends to evocative stimuli converge over time (Anderson, Keltner, {\&} John, 2003).

Such reciprocal emotional experiences benefit relationships by promoting co- ordinated thoughts and actions, mutual understanding, and interpersonal closeness (Hatfield, Cacioppo, {\&} Rapson, 1994; Keltner {\&} Kring, 1998)

Emotional complementarity is most evident in studies of harm, need, and suffering, which can evoke responses of compassion, pity, sadness, or even anger

Feelings of sympathy and compassion prompt helping behavior, thus enhancing the welfare of individuals in distress (Batson, O'Quin, Fultz, Vanderplas, {\&} Isen, 1983).

Complementary emotional responses to another person's suffering, therefore, benefit relationships by motivating prosocial behavior—a notion that dovetails with findings that complementarity of non- verbal behavior increases affection and comfort (Tiedens {\&} Fragale, 2003). 

Social power reflects the relative influence an individual exerts over other people's outcomes, and is experienced in terms of the sense of control, agency, and freedom (Fiske, 1993)

The approach/inhibition theory of power (Keltner, Gruenfeld, {\&} An- derson, 2003) provides a basis for predictions regarding how emotional reciprocity and complementarity will vary according to the power relations of the individuals involved:

- high-power individuals experience fewer social constraints and more resource-rich environments than other people. As a result, they show evidence of an activated approach system—relatively automatic information processing, behavioral disinhibition, and elevated positive emotion (e.g., Guinote, 2007).

Low-power individuals, by contrast, experience greater social constraints, threats, and punishments. As a result, they show greater evidence of an activated behavioral inhibition system—more thorough information processing, behavioral inhibition, and negative emotion

High-power individuals have been shown to experience more
positive and less negative emotions than low-power people (Anderson {\&} Berdahl, 2002; Langner {\&} Keltner, 2008), and to express their positive emotions more (Berdahl {\&} Martorana, 2006; Hecht {\&} LaFrance, 1998). 

evidence suggests that high-power individuals are less accurate judges of other people's emotions than low-power individuals are (Galinsky, Magee, Inesi, {\&} Gruenfeld, 2006; Gonzaga, Keltner, {\&} Ward, in press).

High-power individuals also react less to others' emotions. Anderson et al. (2003) found that low-power partners assimilated more to their higher-power partners in their emo- tional responses than vice versa. 

Negotiation studies found that low-power negotiators conceded more to angry opponents than to happy ones, whereas high-power negotiators did not adjust their demands to their opponent's emotion (Van Kleef, De Dreu, {\&} Manstead, 2004).

Elevated power may reduce the propensity to respond emotionally to other people's suffering via three potential mechanisms:

1. Baseline Account: given that powerful people appear generally disposed to experience more positive than negative emotion (Anderson{\&}Berdahl, 2002; Berdahl{\&}Martorana, 2006; Hecht {\&} LaFrance, 1998), one would expect them to respond with less distress and compassion to the suffering of others than low-power people do 

2. Decoding Accont: powerful people appear to attend less to their less powerful counterparts than vice versa (Fiske, 1993). As a result, they may perceive other people's emotions less accurately (Galinsky et al., 2006), and therefore fail to respond to other people's suffering with distress and compassion for the simple reason that they do not perceive that suffering (a decoding account)

3. Motivational Account: less dependent on other people, and therefore less invested in interactions with them (De Dreu {\&} Van Kleef, 2004). Lack of motivation to affiliate should reduce high-power individuals' responsiveness to the suffering of others



Hypotheses:
Concerning reciprocal emotional responses, 1) high-power individuals would experience less reciprocal distress than low-power individuals when confronted with their partner's distress.

Regarding emotional complementarity, 2) high-power individuals would feel less compassion than low-power individuals in response to their partner's distress.

In addition, we explored whether power affects autonomic emotion regulation as reflected in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity, an index of the neural regulation of the heart rate via the vagus nerve (Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, {\&} Maiti, 1994).

RSA Evidence:
Parasympathetic down-regulation of emotions in response to psychological stressors is marked by increased RSA, which facilitates a lower heart rate and a more relaxed state

relative to a comparison group, women who were in- structed to regulate their emotions during a conversation about a negative film showed increased RSA during the conversation (Butler, Wilhelm, {\&} Gross, 2006)

More generally, self-regula- tory efforts, such as denying oneself a cookie or persisting at a tedious mental task, are accompanied by increased vagal control of the heart (Segerstrom {\&} Solberg Nes, 2007)

Prediction: 
expected high-power individuals (but not low-power individuals) to re- spond to increasing levels of distress from their partner with increased autonomic emotion regulation, thus tempering their emotional responses to the partner's suffering


Methods:
118 undergraduates (70 females, 48 males; mean age 5 20.90 years, SD 5 4.99; 49.3{\%} Asian American, 29.6{\%} Caucasian, 4.2{\%} Hispanic, 3.5{\%} African American, 13.4{\%}other) UC Berkley

Procedure Previously unacquainted same-sex partnerswere randomly paired, seated approximately 2 ft apart in comfortable chairs facing one another, and connected to physiological monitoring

Before interacting, the partners completed measures of social power and baseline emotions

Participants were then asked to think about an event during the past 5 years that had caused them a great deal of emotional suffering and pain.
what motivates these people to share their personal/intimate autobiographical memories with strangers? 

For 3 min, each participant wrote a summary of this event in his or her questionnaire packet. Each participant then took a 5-min turn talking about his or her event while the other participant listened. Emotion ratings were obtained after each turn.

Minimal Tasks:
As talkers, participants were instructed to convey the feelings evoked by the event and its impact on their life.
As listeners, participants were instructed to attempt to gain an understanding of the other person's experience, and they were allowed to ask questions to that end.

Baseline Emotional Experience:
participants indicated on 7-point scales (15not at all,75very strongly) the extent to which they felt a variety of emotions ‘‘right now.'' Positive emotions were assessed by three items (happy, optimistic, hopeful), which were combined (Cronbach's a 5 .83). Baseline distress was also measured by three items (disturbed, distressed, troubled; a5.80), as was compassion (touched, compassion, sympathy; a 5 .80).

Assessment of Power: Subjective experience of social status
Sense of Power scale (Anderson{\&} Galinsky, 2006), which taps into individuals' general sense of power. This measure is based on the idea that individuals form internal representations of their power relative to others across contexts and relationships.
Thus, the sense of power as measured by this scale is anchored in relational experiences. The scale consists of a stem (‘‘In my relationships with others . . . '') and eight items: ‘‘I can get people to listen to what I say,'' ‘‘My wishes do not carry much weight'' (reverse-scored), ‘‘I can get others to do what I want,'' ‘‘Even if I voice them, my views have little sway'' (reverse-scored), ‘‘I think I have a great deal of power,'' ‘‘My ideas and opinions are often ignored'' (reverse- scored), ‘‘Even when I try, I am not able to get my way'' (reverse- scored), and ‘‘If I want to, I get to make the decisions.'' Responses are made on scales from 1 (strongly disagree)to 7(strongly agree). Scores
Predict here to need a different measure in China - where objective power is more important?

Scores on this scale are correlated with people's actual standing in power hierarchies and predict the same behaviors as structural manipulations of power and ma- nipulations based on semantic priming and autobiographic re- call (Anderson {\&} Berdahl, 2002; Anderson {\&} Galinsky, 2006)

Emotional Experience During the Conversations 
After each conversation, the talker's distress and the listener's distress were measured on 7-point scales (1 5 not at all,7 5 very strongly). Participants rated how disturbed, distressed, and troubled they felt during the preceding conversation; ratings for the three items were combined (as5.83 and .87 for talkers and listeners, respectively). In addition, the listener rated the extent towhich he or she felt touched, compassion, and sympathy during the preceding conversation; these ratings were combined to form a scale measuring the listener's compassion (a 5 .85)

Decoding of the Partner's Distress
After each conversation, the listener also rated how disturbed, distressed, and troubled he or she thought the talker felt during the discussion (1 5 not at all,7 5 very strongly; a 5 .89).

face-to-face dyadic interactions during which participants disclosed experiences of suffering.

RSA Reactivity
Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, sampled at 1000 Hz, were obtained from leads placed on the torso in a Lead II configura- tion using an ambulatory monitoring system (Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All data were filtered for arti- facts. RSAwas calculated in the 0.12- to 0.40-Hz band of the R- wave-to-R-wave interbeat interval series using CMET cardiac metric software (Allen, 2002). Baseline RSA was calculated from 2 min of ECG data acquired 15 min after the start of the experiment, during the time when participants were quietly filling in questionnaires. Listeners' RSA reactivity was calcu- lated by subtracting baselineRSAfromRSAfor the first 2 min of each interaction

Feelings About the Partner
After the conversations, participants reported their feelings about their partner. Five items assessed participants' motivation to affiliate with their partner: ‘‘I would like to get to know the other participant better,'' ‘‘I feel like the other participant and I are friends,'' ‘‘I feel close to the other participant,'' ‘‘I would like to befriend the other participant,'' and ‘‘I would like to spend more time with the other participant.'' These items were com- bined in an index of affiliation motivation. Finally, three items measured participants' trust and connection with their partner: ‘‘I feel the other participant trusts me,'' ‘‘I feel I can trust the other participant,'' and ‘‘I feel connected to the other participant'' (a 5 .85)


Results:
HLM revealed that talkers told more intense stories to higher-power listeners, b 5 .23, t(114) 5 2.43, p {\textless} .05. Thus, our hypothesis tests were conservative, in that more- powerful listeners were actually responding to more emotionally evocative stories

We included story intensity as a control variable to account for its possible impact (analyses without this control yielded similar results)

Found that (perceived social) Power Moderates Listeners' Emotional Responses to Talkers' Suffering, with 

1. high power individuals responding with less distress to their partner's distress than low-power individuals
(significant interactive effect of talker's distress and listener's power on listener's distress, b 5 ?.20, t(114) 5
?2.02, p{\textless}.05)

2. high power indiciduals responding with less compassion to their interacction partner's distress than low power individuals
significant interactive effect of talker's distress and listener's power on listener's compassion, b 5 ?.25, t(114) 5 ?2.61, p {\textless} .01. 
An increase in talker's distress was ac- companied by increased compassion on the part of low-power listeners (b 5 .31, p {\textless} .01), but not high-power listeners (b 5
?.19, p 5 .20)

2. RSA Reactivity:
HLM yielded an interactive effect of talker's distress and listener's power on listener's RSA reactivity, b 5 .23, t(114) 5 2.37, p {\textless} .05. As Figure 3 shows, high-power listeners' RSA reactivity was a positive function of talkers' level of distress—as talkers' distress went up, listeners' RSA reactivity increased (b 5 .37, p {\textless} .05). By contrast, low- power listeners' RSA reactivity was not significantly associated with talkers' level of distress (b=-.22, p=.16).
No significant main effect of power on RSA reactivity (b 5 ?.09, p 5 .37). These findings suggest that emotional reactions to increases in talkers' distress were buffered by autonomic emotion regulation in high-power listeners, but not in low-power listeners


Baseline Explanation?
controlling for baseline differences in emotionality did not reduce the reported effects of power on distress (without control: b 5 ?.18, p {\textless} .05; with control: b5?.20, p{\textless}.05) or compassion (without control: b5 ?.22, p {\textless} .01; with control: b 5 ?.25, p {\textless} .01).

Decoding Explanation?
Evidence fitting this explanation would be an interactive effect of (X) talker's self-rated distress and listener's power on (Y) listener's perception of talker's distress

one would expect listener's perception of talker's distress to be more strongly predicted by talker's distress when the listener's power was low rather than
high. However, this interaction was not significant (b 5 ?.14, p5.15).Amedian split of participants into high-power and low- power groups also revealed no evidence for differential decoding accuracy, which was operationalized as the correlation between the talker's self-rated distress and the listener's rating of the talker's distress (r5.24 for low-power participants, r5.22 for high-power participants)


Motivational Explanation?
Participants' self-rated feelings about their partners supported a motivational explanation of the relationship between power and emotional responding
Higher-power people reported a weaker desire to get to know and establish a friendship with their partner, b 5 ?.27, t(114) 5 ?2.99, p {\textless} .01

Furthermore, motivation to get to know the other participant was significantly correlated with listener's self-reported distress (r5.27, p{\textless}.01) and compassion (r 5 .25, p {\textless} .01). Simple-slope analyses showed that controlling for motivation to affiliate eliminated the effects of talker's distress on listener's distress (b 5 ?.07, p 5 .87) and compassion (b 5 ?.01, p 5 .98) among lower-power listeners, and eliminated the effect of talker's distress on RSA
reactivity among higher-power listeners (b =.06, p=.88).

We also found an effect of listener's power on talker's sense of social connectedness: Talkers felt less connection with higher-power listeners, b5?.20, t(114)5?2.10, p{\textless}.05. This, too, suggests that higher-power individuals were less motivated to invest emotionally in their conversation partners

Discussion

social power attenuates emotional reactions to those who suffer

Higher-power participants experienced less reciprocal emotion (distress) and less complementary emotion (compassion) in response to another individual disclosing an experience of suffering, and they showed more autonomic emotion regulation as well

reciprocal-influence model of social power (Keltner, Van Kleef, Chen, {\&} Kraus, 2008): the principle that the thoughts, desires, and emotions of individuals with power are prioritized in social interaction.

High-power individuals did not show such contingent emotional re- sponses: Their self-reported levels of distress and compassion were not affected by their partner's distress, even though they heard more intense stories than low-power individuals did

These findings are all the more impressive when one considers that no explicit power differences were made salient. In com- bination with evidence that high-power individuals' emotions shape negotiations more strongly than low-power individuals' emotions (Van Kleef et al., 2004), the present findings strongly suggest that the emotions of powerful individuals disproportionately sway the direction of social interactions.

In a more speculative vein, the physiological data suggest that high-power individuals engaged parasympathetic processes (i.e., RSA reactivity) to buffer themselves against the partner's distress

Our findings sug- gest that high-power people do not necessarily attend less to others (see also Chen, Ybarra,{\&}Kiefer, 2004; Overbeck{\&}Park, 2001); rather, they appear to be less motivated to respond to others. This conclusion is compatible with recent work on conflict indicating that high-power parties are not insensitive to their opponent's emotions, but react selectively to these emo- tions when doing so can further their own goals (Van Kleef {\&} Coˆte´, 2007)

Alternate explanations:
1. high-power people are less motivated to connect with distressed individuals than low-power people are because they have better social networks and are less interested in forming new relationships? 

Future research involving random assignment of participants to different power levels is needed to rule out alternative explanations regarding the underlying processes responsible for the observed effects.},

A possible pathway, involving the superior colliculus and pulvinar, is suggested by observations of patients with striate cortex lesions who show preserved abilities to localize and discriminate visual stimuli that are not consciously perceived ("blindsight"). We used measures of right amygdala neural activity acquired from volunteer subjects viewing masked fear-conditioned faces to determine whether a colliculo-pulvinar pathway was engaged during processing of these unseen target stimuli. Increased connectivity between right amygdala, pulvinar, and superior colliculus was evident when fear-conditioned faces were unseen rather than seen. Right amygdala connectivity with fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices decreased in the same condition. By contrast, the left amygdala, whose activity did not discriminate seen and unseen fear-conditioned targets, showed no masking-dependent changes in connectivity with superior colliculus or pulvinar. These results suggest that a subcortical pathway to the right amygdala, via midbrain and thalamus, provides a route for processing behaviorally relevant unseen visual events in parallel to a cortical route necessary for conscious identification.},

abstract = {1. It has been generally accepted that regular physical activity is$\backslash$nassociated with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. In$\backslash$nfact, the idea that exercise maintains cardiovascular health is evident$\backslash$nby the direct links between a sedentary lifestyle and the risk of$\backslash$ncardiovascular and other disease states.$\backslash$n2. Cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure, are$\backslash$noften associated with sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity.$\backslash$nConversely, exercise has been shown to reduce hypertension and decrease$\backslash$nelevated SNS activity. In addition, there is evidence that exercise may$\backslash$nreduce resting blood pressure and sympathetic outflow in normal$\backslash$nindividuals.$\backslash$n3. Although somewhat controversial in humans, evidence from animal$\backslash$nstudies also indicates that exercise training reduces$\backslash$nbaroreflex-mediated and other forms of sympathoexcitation in normal$\backslash$nindividuals. Collectively, these data are consistent with the hypothesis$\backslash$nthat physical activity may decrease, and physical inactivity may$\backslash$nincrease, the incidence of cardiovascular disease via alterations in SNS$\backslash$nactivity. Despite the important clinical implications of this$\backslash$npossibility, the mechanisms by which exercise alters control of SNS$\backslash$nactivity remain to be fully elucidated.$\backslash$n4. Recent evidence suggests that central nervous system (CNS) plasticity$\backslash$noccurs under a variety of conditions, including varying levels of$\backslash$nphysical activity.

exercise training reduces baroreflex-mediated and other forms of sympathoexcitation in normal individuals

training may reduce sympathoexcitation by reducing activation of neurons within cardiovascular regions of the brain

physical activity induced neuroplasticity within central cardiovascular networks contributes to long-term cardiovascular health

these data suggested that alterations downstream from the NTS were responsible for blunted sympathoexcita-tion observed after exercise training.


Mechanisms of exercise-induced CNS plasticity:


reasons behind the importance of CNS-mediated effects of exercise on SNS:

DiCarlo and Bishop were the first to demonstrate directly that exercise training blunted baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitation by recording direct efferent outflow from renal nerves in conscious treadmill-trained rabbits

The important subsequent studies by this group reported no influence of exercise training on arterial baroreceptor or cardiopulmonary afferent sensitivity, despite producing blunted baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitation.

Thus, DiCarlo et al. suggested that centrally mediated alterations were important in the reflex control of the SNS following exercise training

More recent studies have supported these hypotheses by demonstrating changes in neuronal structure and intrinsic firing properties of neurons from physically active versus sedentary animals.

Results in differential alterations in the primary central pathways by which SNS activity is regulated. 

We speculate that these changes ultimately influence cardiovascular health and well-being due to the direct and indirect influences of the SNS on the cardiovascular system and other organ systems that impact the incidence of cardiovascular disease

Neural Mechanisms:
Cardiovascular afferents, including those from arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, terminate at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)

NTS is an important brain region involved in both resting and reflex control of arterial pressure and SNS activity

Neurons within the NTS provide a tonic inhibitory influence on SNS activity (primarily via arterial baroreceptors), as evidenced by large increases in arterial pressure and sympathetic outflow produced by inhibition of the NTS. 

We hypothesized that the NTS may be overactive in
exercise-trained animals and, thus, contribute to reduced sympatho- excitation in the trained state
we observed blunted pressor and sympathoexcitatory responses to NTS inhibition in trained animals
These data are similar to the blunted baroreflex-mediated sym-pathoexcitation in most animal models of exercise training and suggested to us that that the NTS was not required for expression of blunted sympathoexcitation following exercise training


GABAergic inhibition is
generally thought to be mediated by both arterial baroreceptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

baroreceptor unloading a greater remaining level of GABAergic in- hibition of RVLM neurons could be responsible for blunted baroreflex- mediated sympathoexcitation in trained animals.

we would predict that sympathoexcitatory responses to blockade of GABAA receptors in the RVLM of exercise-trained rats would be enhanced.

Therefore, we hypothesized that perhaps a reduced activation of RVLM neurons was occurring and was responsible for diminished sympathoexcitatory responses. To test whether responses to generalized excitation of the RVLM
were reduced by training, we activated the RVLM with microinjec- tions of glutamate (1, 3 and 10 mmol/L) in sedentary and treadmill- trained rats.59
Consistent with our hypothesis of blunted excitation,
glutamate produced sympathoexcitation that was significantly attenuated in exercise-trained compared with sedentary rats

Because our treadmill-trained rats have blunted sympathoexcitatory responses to glutamate micro- injections in the RVLM (Fig. 3b), we hypothesized that activation of the somatosympathetic reflex would produce blunted sym- pathoexcitation in trained animals

sciatic nerve stimulation produces increases in sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure in anaesthetized rats. 

exercise training appears to reduce sympathoexcitation to a variety of centrally mediated sympathoexcitatory stimuli. If so, a reduction in sympathoexcitation may contribute, in part, to the reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease in physically active individuals. Conversely, sedentary conditions may produce relatively heightened sympathoexcitatory responses that, over time, could contribute to cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {Increasing data suggest that meditation impacts stress-related physiological processes relevant to health and disease. For example, our group recently reported that the practice of compassion meditation was associated with reduced innate immune (plasma interleukin [IL]-6) and subjective distress responses to a standardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]). However, because we administered a TSST after, but not prior to, meditation training in our initial study, it remained possible that associations between practice time and TSST outcomes reflected the fact that participants with reduced stress responses prior to training were more able to practice compassion meditation, rather than that meditation practice reduced stress responses. To help resolve this ambiguity, we conducted the current study to evaluate whether innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to a TSST conducted prior to compassion meditation training in an independent sample of 32 medically health young adults would predict subsequent amount of meditation practice time during a compassion meditation training protocol identical to the one used in our first study. No associations were found between responses to a TSST administered prior to compassion meditation training and subsequent amount of meditation practice, whether practice time was considered as a continuous variable or whether meditators were divided into high and low practice time groups based on a median split of mean number of practice sessions per week. These findings contrast strikingly with our original study, in which high and low practice time meditators demonstrated marked differences in IL-6 and distress responses to a TSST administered after meditation training. In addition to providing the first published data regarding stress responsivity as a potential predictor of subsequent ability/willingness to practice meditation, the current study strengthens findings from our initial work by supporting the conclusion that in individuals who actively engage in practicing the technique, compassion meditation may represent a viable strategy for reducing potentially deleterious physiological and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Telomerase activity is a predictor of long-term cellular viability, which decreases with chronic psychological distress (Epel et al., 2004). Buddhist traditions claim that meditation decreases psychological distress and promotes well-being (e.g., Dalai Lama and Cutler, 2009). Therefore, we investigated the effects of a 3-month meditation retreat on telomerase activity and two major contributors to the experience of stress: Perceived Control (associated with decreased stress) and Neuroticism (associated with increased subjective distress). We used mediation models to test whether changes in Perceived Control and Neuroticism explained meditation retreat effects on telomerase activity. In addition, we investigated whether two qualities developed by meditative practice, increased Mindfulness and Purpose in Life, accounted for retreat-related changes in the two stress-related variables and in telomerase activity. Methods: Retreat participants (n= 30) meditated for ???6 h daily for 3 months and were compared with a wait-list control group (n= 30) matched for age, sex, body mass index, and prior meditation experience. Retreat participants received instruction in concentrative meditation techniques and complementary practices used to cultivate benevolent states of mind (Wallace, 2006). Psychological measures were assessed pre- and post-retreat. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected post-retreat for telomerase activity. Because there were clear, a priori hypotheses, 1-tailed significance criteria were used throughout. Results: Telomerase activity was significantly greater in retreat participants than in controls at the end of the retreat (p{\textless} 0.05). Increases in Perceived Control, decreases in Neuroticism, and increases in both Mindfulness and Purpose in Life were greater in the retreat group (p{\textless} 0.01). Mediation analyses indicated that the effect of the retreat on telomerase was mediated by increased Perceived Control and decreased Neuroticism. In turn, changes in Perceived Control and Neuroticism were both partially mediated by increased Mindfulness and Purpose in Life. Additionally, increases in Purpose in Life directly mediated the telomerase group difference, whereas increases in Mindfulness did not. Conclusions: This is the first study to link meditation and positive psychological change with telomerase activity. Although we did not measure baseline telomerase activity, the data suggest that increases in perceived control and decreases in negative affectivity contributed to an increase in telomerase activity, with implications for telomere length and immune cell longevity. Further, Purpose in Life is influenced by meditative practice and directly affects both perceived control and negative emotionality, affecting telomerase activity directly as well as indirectly. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Meditation practices may impact physiological pathways that are modulated by stress and relevant to disease. While much attention has been paid to meditation practices that emphasize calming the mind, improving focused attention, or developing mindfulness, less is known about meditation practices that foster compassion. Accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation practice influenced stress reactivity. Sixty-one healthy adults were randomized to 6 weeks of training in compassion meditation (n = 33) or participation in a health discussion control group (n = 28) followed by exposure to a standardized laboratory stressor (Trier social stress test [TSST]). Physiologic and behavioral responses to the TSST were determined by repeated assessments of plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and cortisol as well as total distress scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS). No main effect of group assignment on TSST responses was found for IL-6, cortisol or POMS scores. However, within the meditation group, increased meditation practice was correlated with decreased TSST-induced IL-6 (rp = -0.46, p = 0.008) and POMS distress scores (rp = -0.43, p = 0.014). Moreover, individuals with meditation practice times above the median exhibited lower TSST-induced IL-6 and POMS distress scores compared to individuals below the median, who did not differ from controls. These data suggest that engagement in compassion meditation may reduce stress-induced immune and behavioral responses, although future studies are required to determine whether individuals who engage in compassion meditation techniques are more likely to exhibit reduced stress reactivity. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic psychological stress is associated with detrimental effects on physical health, and may operate in part through accelerated cell aging, as indexed by shorter telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. However, not all people under stress have distinctly short telomeres, and we examined whether exercise can serve a stress-buffering function. We predicted that chronic stress would be related to short telomere length (TL) in sedentary individuals, whereas in those who exercise, stress would not have measurable effects on telomere shortening. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 63 healthy post-menopausal women underwent a fasting morning blood draw for whole blood TL analysis by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983), and for three successive days reported daily minutes of vigorous activity. Participants were categorized into two groups-sedentary and active (those getting Centers for Disease Control-recommended daily amount of activity). The likelihood of having short versus long telomeres was calculated as a function of stress and exercise group, covarying age, BMI and education. Logistic regression analyses revealed a significant moderating effect of exercise. As predicted, among non-exercisers a one unit increase in the Perceived Stress Scale was related to a 15-fold increase in the odds of having short telomeres (p{\textless}.05), whereas in exercisers, perceived stress appears to be unrelated to TL (B = -.59, SE = .78, p = .45). DISCUSSION: Vigorous physical activity appears to protect those experiencing high stress by buffering its relationship with TL. We propose pathways through which physical activity acts to buffer stress effects.},

abstract = {It is now well established that brain plasticity is an inherent property not only of the developing but also of the adult brain. Numerous beneficial effects of exercise, including improved memory, cognitive function and neuroprotection, have been shown to involve an important neuroplastic component. However, whether major adaptive cardiovascular adjustments during exercise, needed to ensure proper blood perfusion of peripheral tissues, also require brain neuroplasticity, is presently unknown. This review will critically evaluate current knowledge on proposed mechanisms that are likely to underlie the continuous resetting of baroreflex control of heart rate during/after exercise and following exercise training. Accumulating evidence indicates that not only somatosensory afferents (conveyed by skeletal muscle receptors, baroreceptors and/or cardiopulmonary receptors) but also projections arising from central command neurons (in particular, peptidergic hypothalamic pre-autonomic neurons) converge into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the dorsal brainstem, to co-ordinate complex cardiovascular adaptations during dynamic exercise. This review focuses in particular on a reciprocally interconnected network between the NTS and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which is proposed to act as a pivotal anatomical and functional substrate underlying integrative feedforward and feedback cardiovascular adjustments during exercise. Recent findings supporting neuroplastic adaptive changes within the NTS-PVN reciprocal network (e.g. remodelling of afferent inputs, structural and functional neuronal plasticity and changes in neurotransmitter content) will be discussed within the context of their role as important underlying cellular mechanisms supporting the tonic activation and improved efficacy of these central pathways in response to circulatory demand at rest and during exercise, both in sedentary and in trained individuals. We hope this review will stimulate more comprehensive studies aimed at understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms within CNS neuronal networks that contribute to exercise-induced neuroplasticity and cardiovascular adjustments.},

Opposite autonomic effects, i.e. reduced parasympathetic and increased sympathetic drive, are observed during loading of the baroreceptors.

Baroreceptors:
Among the intrinsic mechanisms controlling cardiovascular function, the arterial mechanoreceptors (also known as baroreceptors) are important controllers implicated in maintaining short-term stability of arterial pressure. Baroreceptors detect vessel stretch caused by pressure increases, codifying this information into bursts of action potentials (proportional to pressure changes), whichare then sent tothenucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the dorsal brainstem, the primary termination site for the cardiovascular afferents 

Second-orderNTS glutamatergic neurons (as well as higher-order NTS neurons) excite both parasympathetic preganglionic cell bodies (in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus ambiguus) and the sympathetic cell groups in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM; GABAergic inhibitory neurons) that project to and inhibit rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) glutamatergic neurons, thus decreasing sympathetic preganglionic neuronal outflow

During unloading of baroreceptors, increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic outflows (regulated by this simple reflex loop integrated within the brainstem), cause a marked bradycardic response, diminished cardiac output, increased venous capacitance and decreased total peripheral resistance (Palkovits, 1988; Dampney, 1994; Sved {\&} Gordon, 1994)


Two main neural mechanisms:
(a) a feedforward mechanism, so-called ‘central command', which involves higher brain centres, such as the motor cortex, hypothalamic and mesencephalic locomotor regions, that activates parallel circuits controlling locomotor, cardiovascular and ventilatory functions; and 
(b) a feedback control mechanism, driven by receptors fromcardiovascular areas and activemuscles.

Dynamic interactions between these feedforward and feedback circuits are associated with beneficial adjustments in both parasympathetic and sympathetic tone to the heart and in the sympathetic outflow to vessels, enabling the coexistence of exercise tachycardia in the presence of moderately increased pressure levels (Ludbrook {\&} Graham, 1985; Mitchell, 1990; Rowell {\&} O'Leary, 1990; Michelini {\&} Morris, 1999; Michelini, 2001) and the appearance of resting bradycardia in trained individuals


NTS-PVM-NTS Loop:
Recent studies from our laboratories have shown that baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate, as well as the adjustment of tachycardic response during exercise, could be reset and modulated, respectively, by this reciprocal interconnectivity between the NTS and PVN (noradrenergic) and the PVN and NTS (oxytocinergic, vasopressinergic), thus acting as an anatomical substrate for a prompt feedback control loop for cardiovascular adjustments during exercise.

whether and how functional and structural remodelling within this interconnected circuit contribute to adjustment of baroreceptor function during dynamic exercise and exercise training.

When compared with sedentary control animals, trained rats exhibited a robust increase in hypothalamic OT mRNA expression (Fig. 1B), without any changes in OT receptor expression within the NTS/DMV area.

Oxytocin immunoreactivity within the NTS/DMV area was also markedly increased after training

Although we could not detect parallel changes in vasopressinergic terminals,we observed a marked increase in the sensitivity of vasopressin V1 receptors to the endogenous ligand in the NTS following exercise training (quantitative autoradiography; De Souza et al. 2001)

To shed light onto the functional significance of exercise-induced increases in oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic input to the DBS, we compared exercise- induced tachycardia and pressure responses before and after microinjection of OT and VP receptors antagonists/agonists within the NTS/DMV, in conscious sedentary andtrained rats runningona treadmill(Dufloth et al. 1997; Braga et al. 2000)

Blockade of NTS OT receptors caused a marked increase in the tachycardic responseat all exercise intensities only in the trainedgroup, without changes in sedentary control animals 

In contrast, NTS V1 receptor blockade reduced the magnitude of exercise tachycardia in both groups,with a larger effect in trained rats (Fig. 2C, and D;Dufloth et al. 1997)

The effects of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic drives
on baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate were also investigated. Administration

oxytocinergic pathways to this area) improved the gain of reflex bradycardia and displaced the inferior plateau towards a lower heart rate value, thus increasing the operational range of the reflex (Higa et al. 2002)

doses of VP given
into the NTS of sedentary rats at rest did not change the sensitivity of reflex bradycardia but displaced the set-point of the reflex towards higher heart rate values (Michelini {\&} Bonagamba, 1988)

Based on these observations, we proposed that PVN–NTS vasopressinergic projections activated during exercise act to restrain afferent information conveyed by the baroreceptors, resulting in a reduced bradycardic response for a given pressure increase (Michelini, 1994;Michelini {\&}Morris, 1999)

abstract = {This article proposes a new role for emergent group leaders, that of the manager of group emotions. This description of leadership suggests that individual group members take leadership by providing certainty and direction during times of ambiguity. They are able to assume a leadership role by making an interpretation of the emotional response that best serves the group's needs, and then modeling that response. By modeling a particular emotional response, the leader resolves ambiguity and catalyzes the group to act. Simultaneously, they are able to increase group solidarity by creating shared emotion within the group and communal action. The idea of leadership as group emotional management is not tied to one specific individual, but rather, allows leadership to be enacted by different group members at different times. Leader emergence and leader success would be subject to several conditions, such as the emergent leader's degree of empathy, group norms of emotional expression, and ambiguous feedback regarding the group's performance. Qualitative analysis of group observation reveals several examples of group emotional management that are used to develop the concept. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the proestrous female rat, norepinephrine, oxytocin and nitric oxide (NO) all participate in the regulation of the preovulatory gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that oxytocin induces dose-dependent release of GnRH from proestrous basal hypothalamus explants. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether norepinephrine could also stimulate GnRH release from similar explants, to identify the receptors responsible for this effect and to investigate interactions between norepinephrine, oxytocin and NO. Norepinephrine significantly stimulated GnRH release from proestrous basal hypothalamus explants, and coadministration of the alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist prazosin blocked this effect. Combined administration of oxytocin and norepinephrine stimulated significantly more GnRH release than either drug alone, and this stimulation was blocked by inhibition of NO synthase, or by an oxytocin receptor antagonist. NO production was measured from the same samples using a modified Griess reaction. Oxytocin, but not norepinephrine, significantly increased NO production, as did norepinephrine and oxytocin in combination. Oxytocin receptor antagonist administration attenuated the stimulation of NO production by norepinephrine/oxytocin. These results demonstrate for the first time that oxytocin and norepinephrine dramatically stimulate GnRH release from basal hypothalamus explants harvested on the afternoon of proestrus, and indicate that this involves oxytocin receptor and NO-dependent mechanisms.},

Facial electromyographic (EMG) activity and electrodermal activity (EDA) were recorded during task performance. Negative cues of group emotion elicited lower self-reported pleasure, lower perceived confidence in the other group members, higher corrugator supercilii EMG activity and higher EDA compared with cues of positive group emotions. Planning tasks elicited higher self-reported pleasure and arousal, lower corrugator EMG activity, and higher EDA compared with routine tasks. The results suggest that mediated textual cues of group emotion can lead to emotional contagion to the individual group members during distributed knowledge work.},

abstract = {The presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that catalyses the formation of nitric oxide (NO), in the circumventricular organs and magnocellular neurones suggests an important role of NO in the modulation of vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) release. Intracerebroventricular (I.C.V.) injection of angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates the release of AVP, OT and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), with the resultant antidiuretic and natriuretic effects. This study investigated the interaction between nitrergic and angiotensinergic pathways on the release of AVP, OT and ANP and on urinary volume and sodium excretion in water-loaded rats. Unanaesthetized, freely moving, male Wistar rats received two water loads followed by an injection into the lateral ventricle of an inhibitor of NOS (L-NAME), a NO donor [3-morpholinylsydnoneimine chloride (SIN-1) or S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP)] or vehicle (isotonic saline) and, 20 min after, they received a second I.C.V. injection of Ang II or vehicle. Injections of L-NAME or Ang II produced an increase in plasma levels of AVP, OT and ANP, a reduction in urinary volume and an increase in sodium excretion. Pretreatment with L-NAME enhanced the Ang II-induced increase in AVP, OT and ANP release, as well as the antidiuresis and natriuresis. Injection of SIN-1 or SNAP did not modify hormonal plasma levels and urinary parameters. In contrast SNAP blocked the AVP, OT and ANP release, as well as antidiuretic and natriuretic responses induced by ANG-II. Thus, the central nitrergic system can act to inhibit AVP, OT and ANP secretion and the antidiuretic and natriuretic effects in response to Ang II.},

annote = {Group flow is an emergent group property and is not the same thing as the psychological state of flow. It depends on interaction among performers and it emerges from this process

improvisation, collaboration and emergence
structure and improvisation are always both present in group creativity

IMPROVISATION: in most forms of group creativity, the creativity happens in the moment of the encounter. In music and theater, the performers are not mere interpreters; they are creative artists.

COLLABORATION: the creativity of a group cannot be associated with any one person. All members contribute and their interactional dynamics result in the performance

EMERGENCE: refers to collective phenomena in which, as it is said, ‘the whole is greater than the sum of the parts'. Recent studies of emergence by complexity scholars suggest that emergent phenomena are unpredictable, contingent and hard to explain in terms of the group's components.

Jazz Music {\&} Improvisation: ‘trading fours' or ‘trading eights'
There is a great deal of give and take in such improvisational interaction, and such moments are often cited by musicians as aesthetic high points of performances'

each player has barely enough time for one or two phrases. Rather than develop their own musical ideas or starting a completely new idea, each musician continues in the spirit or mood established by the prior players, responding to, and building on, the prior musician's eight bars (Berliner, 1994: 369–70)

In their musical conversations, musicians constantly balance coherence and innovation, borrowing material from the previous phrase and then transforming it.

The dialogues of improvisational theater:

The centralized mindset
we often try to attribute the group's creativity to a single person: the group leader, the soloist, the director or conductor

If group communication is the essence of live jazz, then why do so many photos isolate a single musician away from the rest of the band?
with an example of an emergent group phenomenon, almost subconsciously assume that there is a single leader or organizer
Resnick points out that our centralized mindset almost invariably leads us to assume that complex group behavior results from a central controller

Back to the script
has been spoken by others before. When we use a catchphrase, or say something with a stereotypical inflection or accent, everyone can't help but think of all of the other occasions on which they've heard the same thing

These connotations are like unavoidable baggage that the words bring with them from past situations of use; they're built into the catchphrases, the price we pay for using them. Bakhtin coined the term dialogic to describe this two- leveled nature of language; the two levels are the speaker's own meaning, and everyone's memory of how these words have been used in the past

Good improv actors are pop-culture experts, and improv actors assume that the audience will catch the references they make to popular TV shows or movies: bits and pieces of dialogue, familiar characters, or events from a famous sitcom episode or movie scene

Actors use these styles of talking to communicate characters and situations, quickly and implicitly communicating to each other about the emerging drama.

This kind of implicit communication is an example of what linguists call indexicality, from the Latin word for ‘point to' or ‘indicate'

Some linguists estimate that as much as 90 percent of all of our spoken language is at least partially indexical – in other words, very little of what we say is completely context-free (e.g. Bar-Hillel, 1954)

The structures of improvisation
The freer the form, the greater must be the underpinnings of discipline. (Ted Flicker, quoted in Sweet, 1978: 161)

two forms of structure that guide their emergent improvisations: scenarios that guide the overall improvisation and formulaic speech that actors use in their individual lines. These structures are always in dialectic with improvisation.

most jazz improvisations are based on the structure of the chorus of the mid-American popular song

These overall structures correspond to the ritualized conversational exchanges that fluent native speakers can jointly participate in, without even thinking hard about it: the greeting routines taught in ESL classes or the small-talk exchanges between Dagwood and the barber 

The three characteristics of group creativity – improvisation, collaboration, and emergence – all take place within a background of structuring elements.

Group Flow:

"There is a thrill in watching them, a thrill born of the precariousness of their position and the ever-present threat that a misjudgment may send them hurtling into a wipeout" 

There are many metaphors one can use to describe a talented ensemble when they are ‘on', in interactional synchrony, performing well. One might say that they have a good chemistry, or that things are clicking or in sync.

For just about any sports team, one can speak of the group spirit, the team spirit, or the esprit de corps. A commentator might say they gelled as a unit or that they displayed good teamwork.

All of these metaphors focus on the entire group and on their performance together as an ensemble.

The concept of group flow is related to Csikszentmihalyi's (1990) flow theory, but with a critical difference. Csikszentmihalyi intended flow to represent a state of consciousness within the individual performer, whereas group flow is a property of the entire group as a collective unit

Group flow has been neglected in studies of flow, which have focused on how individuals attain flow through their own actions (cf. Jimerson, 1999)

In group flow, everything seems to come naturally; the performers are in interactional synchrony (Sawyer, 2003a). In this state, each of the group members can even feel as if they are able to anticipate what their fellow performers will do before they do it.

Group flow is an emergent property of the group. Group flow can inspire
musicians to play things that they would not have been able to play alone, or that they would not have thought of without the inspiration of the group; ‘the highest points of improvisation occur when group members strike a groove together' (Berliner, 1994: 388)

In a study of pick-up basketball games, Jimerson (1999) wrote that flow is caused by groups when it is ‘a result of their interaction with other people, [who] cooperatively maintain their flow, and respond to each other differently than they did before'

Group flow helps the individual performers to attain their own flow state:
group flow in propelling their own performance to ever higher levels: ‘Sometimes, I really feel that I am just the vehicle, the body, and that something is really singing through me, like I am not controlling everything that I am singing' (Carmen Lundy, in Berliner, 1994: 392)

Metaphors of optimal individual and group experience:
Musicians use a wide variety of metaphors to describe group flow: riding a wave, gliding across a ballroom with a dance partner, or lovemaking (Berliner, 1994: 389). Jazz bassist Chuck Israels says: ‘If it's working, it brings you very close. It's a kind of emotional empathy that you develop very quickly. The relationship is very intimate' (Berliner, 1994: 349–50)

‘when that's really happening in a band, the cohesiveness is unbelievable. Those are the special, cherished moments. When those special moments occur, to me, it's like ecstasy. It's like a beautiful thing. It's like when things blossom' (Berliner, 1994: 389)

There is an open communicative channel among the performers; each performer is open and listening to the others and each performer fully attends to what the others are doing, even as they are contributing to the performance themselves

Melba Liston said: ‘everybody can feel what each other is thinking and everything. You breathe together, you swell together, you just do everything together, and a different aura comes over the room' (Berliner, 1994: 392).

Groupmind is the entire troupe working intuitively together toward the same goals. The perfect working of groupmind is an intense experience; comedian Jim Belushi famously said that the high that comes from group flow was ‘better than sex' (Seham, 2001: 64; compare Berliner on jazz, 1994: 389).

‘a state of unselfconscious awareness in which every individual action seems to be the right one and the group works with apparent perfect synchronicity' (Seham, 2001: 64)

group flow requires a type of parallel processing;
the musicians are playing non-stop, yet while they are playing they must simultaneously listen to their band members, hearing and immediately responding to what they are playing. ‘You have to be able to divide your senses . . . so you still have that one thought running through your head of saying something, playing something, at the same time you've got to be listening to what the drummer is doing' (Sawyer interview)

you plunge into that world of sounds . . . and your whole consciousness changes' (Berliner, 1994: 348).

The study of group flow thus requires a fundamentally social psychology and must proceed by examining the interactional dynamics among members during performance

Group Creativity in Scored Music:
Schutz noted that many musical groups achieve synchrony and intersubjectivity without a conductor. Several studies of interaction in musical groups have been influenced by Shutz and his focus on intersubjectivity; for example, Malhotra (1981) studied the gestural communication that serves to coordinate an orchestral performance

She discovered that although the conductor plays an important role in organizing the performance, musicians do not always attend visually to the conductor, and 15 percent of them report never looking at the conductor

As Weeks (1996a) noted, much of the ensemble interaction among
musicians is hidden from the audience during a performance and the intention of all involved is to give the audience the somewhat misleading impression that the musicians are reading ‘the musical text as the composer intended it, under the direction of the conductor then-and-there' (p. 248).

Weeks focused his research on rehearsals, analyzing the interactions of talk and gesture that serve to coordinate the performance and to help the musicians reach a common understanding of the piece

This coordinating talk is completely absent from public performance, and many of the non- verbal gestures are omitted as well. In Weeks's analyses, ensembles require the most interactional work to coordinate temporal features of the performance: the initial tempo of the piece; the rate to slow down the tempo

The covering-up action involved a retrospective contextualization of the mistake, redefining it by modifying the scored performance that immediately followed so that it retroactively seemed to have been the correct note or tempo to have played (p. 216)

Educational implications
all children learn musical practices by being informally socialized into a community of practice, their peer culture

Sociocultural approaches suggest that the goal of musical educators should be to create musical communities of practice, rather than to transmit musical knowledge. In this way, children are socialized into collective musical practices.

An effective group activity, from the community of practice per- spective, allows all learners to participate meaningfully regardless of their level; and it is structured so that each level of participation naturally propels the child to increasing appropriation, mastery and central participation

In such classrooms, students learn more than the mechanics of music.
They learn interactional skills; they learn how to listen and to respond appropriately; they learn to collaborate; they learn to communicate in social contexts.

In these collective improvisational activities, children may learn a deeper musical understanding than they would from structured activities

Children learn best in collaborative, creative classrooms (Sawyer, 2004a).

abstract = {Physiological functions of oxytocin released during stress are not well understood. We have (1) investigated the release of oxytocin during chronic stress using two long-term stress models and (2) simulated stress-induced oxytocin secretion by chronic treatment with oxytocin via osmotic minipumps. Plasma oxytocin levels were significantly elevated in rats subjected to acute immobilization stress for 120 min, to repeated immobilization for 7 days and to combined chronic cold stress exposure for 28 days with 7 days immobilization. To simulate elevation of oxytocin during chronic stress, rats were implanted with osmotic minipumps subcutaneously and treated with oxytocin (3.6 microg/100 g body weight/day) or vehicle for 2 weeks. Chronic subcutaneous oxytocin infusion led to an increase in plasma oxytocin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone, adrenal weights and heart/body weight ratio. Oxytocin treatment had no effect on the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine into DNA in the heart ventricle. Mean arterial pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine was reduced in oxytocin-treated animals. Decrease in adrenal tyrosin hydroxylase mRNA following oxytocin treatment was not statistically significant. Oxytocin treatment failed to modify food intake and slightly increased water consumption. These data provide evidence on increased concentrations of oxytocin during chronic stress. It is possible that the role of oxytocin released during stress is in modulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and selected sympathetic functions.},

In this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that affect in groups, as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states in groups, have had important roles in promoting group survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that affect in groups serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, affect in groups quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared affect in groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of affect in groups are closely related and mutually reinforcing. Current research and directions for future research within an evolutionary perspective are also discussed.},

abstract = {Background: The presence of social support has been associated with decreased stress responsiveness. Recent animal studies suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin is implicated both in prosocial behavior and in the central nervous control of neuroendocrine responses to stress. This study was designed to determine the effects of social support and oxytocin on cortisol, mood, and anxiety responses to psychosocial stress in humans. Methods: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 37 healthy men were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test. All participants were randomly assigned to receive intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo 50 min before stress, and either social support from their best friend during the preparation period or no social support. Results: Salivary free cortisol levels were suppressed by social support in response to stress. Comparisons of pre- and poststress anxiety levels revealed an anxiolytic effect of oxytocin. More importantly, the combination of oxytocin and social support exhibited the lowest cortisol concentrations as well as increased calmness and decreased anxiety during stress. Conclusions: Oxytocin seems to enhance the buffering effect of social support on stress responsiveness. These results concur with data from animal research suggesting an important role of oxytocin as an underlying biological mechanism for stress-protective effects of positive social interactions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Trauma can be repeated on behavioral, emotional, physiologic, and neuroendocrinologic levels. Repetition on these different levels causes a large variety of individual and social suffering. Anger directed against the self or others is always a central problem in the lives of people who have been violated and this is itself a repetitive re-enactment of real events from the past. People need a "safe base" for normal social and biologic development. Traumatization occurs when both internal and external resources are inadequate to cope with external threat. Uncontrollable disruptions or distortions of attachment bonds precede the development of post-traumatic stress syndromes. People seek increased attachment in the face of external danger. Adults, as well as children, may develop strong emotional ties with people who intermittently harass, beat, and threaten them. The persistence of these attachment bonds leads to confusion of pain and love. Assaults lead to hyperarousal states for which the memory can be state-dependent or dissociated, and this memory only returns fully during renewed terror. This interferes with good judgment about these relationships and allows longing for attachment to overcome realistic fears. All primates subjected to early abuse and deprivation are vulnerable to engage in violent relationships with peers as adults. Males tend to be hyperaggressive, and females fail to protect themselves and their offspring against danger. Chronic physiologic hyperarousal persists, particularly to stimuli reminiscent of the trauma. Later stresses tend to be experienced as somatic states, rather than as specific events that require specific means of coping. Thus, victims of trauma may respond to contemporary stimuli as a return of the trauma, without conscious awareness that past injury rather than current stress is the basis of their physiologic emergency responses. Hyperarousal interferes with the ability to make rational assessments and prevents resolution and integration of the trauma. Disturbances in the catecholamine, serotonin, and endogenous opioid systems have been implicated in this persistence of all-or-none responses. People who have been exposed to highly stressful stimuli develop long-term potentiation of memory tracts that are reactivated at times of subsequent arousal. This activation explains how current stress is experienced as a return of the trauma; it causes a return to earlier behavior patterns. Ordinarily, people will choose the most pleasant of two alternatives. High arousal causes people to engage in familiar behavior, regardless of the rewards. As novel stimuli are anxiety provoking, under stress, previously traumatized people tend return to familiar patterns, even if they cause pain.},

Descriptive analyses showed that the ratio of pain-sensitive to pain-tolerant persons was considerably higher than that described in the normative cold-pressor pain literature. Two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect for using status, indicating that current drug use is associated with decreased pain tolerance. The main effect for drug type approached significance, implying that persons who abuse opioids manifest less pain tolerance than cocaine users.

abstract = {Until recently, claims for the psychological benefits of physical exercise have tended to precede supportive evidence. Acutely, emotional effects of exercise remain confusing, both positive and negative effects being reported. Results of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are more consistent in indicating that aerobic exercise training has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and protects against harmful consequences of stress. Details of each of these effects remain unclear. Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been demonstrated most clearly in subclinical disorder, and clinical applications remain to be exploited. Cross-sectional studies link exercise habits to protection from harmful effects of stress on physical and mental health, but causality is not clear. Nevertheless, the pattern of evidence suggests the theory that exercise training recruits a process which confers enduring resilience to stress. This view allows the effects of exercise to be understood in terms of existing psychobiological knowledge, and it can thereby provide the theoretical base that is needed to guide future research in this area. Clinically, exercise training continues to offer clinical psychologists a vehicle for nonspecific therapeutic social and psychological processes. It also offers a specific psychological treatment that may be particularly effective for patients for whom more conventional psychological interventions are less acceptable.},

abstract = {The evolution of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle to interpret the adaptive significance of mammalian affective processes including courting, sexual arousal, copulation, and the establishment of enduring social bonds. According to the Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 1995, 1996, 1997), the well-documented phylogenetic shift in the neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system passes through three stages, each with an associated behavioral strategy. The first stage is characterized by a primitive unmyelinated visceral vagus that fosters digestion and responds to threat by depressing metabolic activity. Behaviorally, the first stage is associated with immobilization behaviors. The second stage is characterized by the sympathetic nervous system that is capable of increasing metabolic output and inhibiting the visceral vagus to foster mobilization behaviors necessary for 'fight or flight'. The third stage, unique to mammals, is characterized by a myelinated vagus that can rapidly regulate cardiac output to foster engagement and disengagement with the environment. The mammalian vagus is neuroanatomically linked to the cranial nerves that regulate social engagement via facial expression and vocalization. The Polyvagal Theory provides neurobiological explanations for two dimensions of intimacy: courting and the establishment of enduring pair- bonds. Courting is dependent upon the social engagement strategies associated with the mammalian vagus. The establishment of enduring pair-bonds is dependent upon a co-opting of the visceral vagus from an immobilization system associated with fear and avoidance to an immobilization system associated with safety and trust. The theory proposes that the phylogenetic development of the mammalian vagus is paralleled by a specialized communication, via oxytocin and vasopressin, between the hypothalamus and the medullary source nuclei of the visceral vagus, which facilitates sexual arousal, copulation, and the development of enduring pair-bonds.},
annote = {By blunting the shutdown fear response mediated by the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, oxytocin modulates vagal function to promote homeostasis and shifts the function of the visceral organs to support progenitive behavior and experiences of passion

The conditioning process would be facilitated by systemic vasopressin, that could trigger sexual arousal (e.g. sexual arousal) and central oxytocin, which could modulate vagal responses. The conditioning process may provide a plausible mechanism to explain other classes of behavior including parent–child bonding, friendships, and the visceral reactions to the loss of a loved one either through death or violation of vows of love

The paraventricular regulation of the DVC provides a plausible mechanism for a central switching circuit that determines whether specific DVC processes are fostered or inhibited

The focus of this paper is to describe how the autonomic nervous system is involved in the processes associated with feelings of love and behaviors linked to reproduction

phylogenetic development of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle for affective experiences and determines the range of social and affective behavior

In general, phylogenetic development results in increased neural control of the heart via a mammalian vagal system, which can promote transitory mobilization and the expression of sympathetic tone without requiring sympathetic or adrenal activation

Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 1995, 1996, 1997): phylogenetic shift in the neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system passes through three stages, each with an associated behavioral strategy:

1. primitive unmyelinated visceral vagus that fosters digestion and responds to threat by depressing metabolic activity
Behaviorally: the first stage is associated with immobilization behaviors

2. sympathetic nervous system that is capable of increasing metabolic output and inhibiting the visceral vagus to foster mobilization 
behaviors necessary for ‘fight or flight'

3. characterized by a myelinated vagus that can rapidly regulate cardiac output to foster engagement and disengagement with the environment. The mammalian vagus is neuroanatomically linked to the cranial nerves that regulate social engagement via facial expression and vocalization

The Polyvagal Theory provides neurobiological explanations for two dimensions of intimacy: courting and the establishment of enduring pair-bonds


several neurobiological processes involved in the experience and expression of love are shared with other mammals. The phylogenetic origins of these processes reflect their antecedent adaptive function:

- integrated neurobehavioral system, which promotes proximity, reproduction, and physical safety

Central to the neural mediation of these processes is the autonomic nervous system. The focus of this paper is to describe how the autonomic nervous system is involved in the processes associated with feelings of love and behaviors linked to reproduction

two components of love: 
1. an appetitive phase associated with courting and seductive behaviors and a
2. consumatory phase associate with passionate sexual behaviors and the establishment of enduring pair-bonds

According to this model, courting and seduction are dependent on phylogenet- ically newer structures

For example, the cortex, via corticobulbar pathways, regulates facial expressions and vocalizations to express availability to a prospective mate. In contrast, passionate visceral feelings are dependent upon phylogenetically older structures such as the hypothalamus and medulla, which involve phylogenetically more recent neuropeptides (oxytocin and vasopressin)

The Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 1995, 1997)]
proposes that the evolution of the mammalian autonomic nervous system provides the neurophysiological substrates for the emotional experiences and affective processes that are major components of social behavior.

emphasize and to document the neurophysiological and neuroanatomical distinction between two branches of the tenth cranial nerve (i.e. vagus) and to propose that each vagal branch was associated with a different adaptive behavioral strategy.

- In the most primitive fish, the cyclostomes, the neural control of the heart is very primitive: the cyclostomes there appear to be only excitatory mechanisms to regulate the heart. T
- the elasmobranchs (i.e. cartilaginous fish) are the first vertebrates to have a cardioin- hibitory vagus
The cardioinhibitory vagus is functional in the elasmobranchs as a response to hypoxia. In conditions of hypoxia, the metabolic output is adjusted by reducing heart rate. once the excitatory system is triggered, the ability to self-sooth or calm is limited

the teleosts may be considered phylogenetically the first class of vertebrates
in which the heart is regulated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic neural pathways.

Rabbit in the headlights: With opposing neural mechanisms from sympathetic and vagal pathways, rapid transitory changes in metabolic output are possible to support immediate changes in behavior from mobilization to immobilization. In teleosts this is observed as ‘darting' and ‘freezing' behaviors.

DYNAMIC MOVEMENT:
True adrenal glands, in which there is a distinct medulla formed of chromaffin tissue,
are only present in birds, reptiles and mammals (Santer, 1994).

sympathetics of the adrenal medulla provides a neural mechanism for rapid and controlled release of epinephrine and norepinephrine to increase cardiac output to match the metabolic demands of mobilization behaviors

the mammalian vagus contains two branches:
One branch originates in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and provides the primary neural regulation of subdiaphragmatic organs such as the digestive tract

By transitory down-regulation of the cardioinhibitory vagal tone to the heart (i.e. removing the vagal brake), the mammal is capable of rapid increases in cardiac output without activating the sympathetic-adrenal system

Under prolonged challenge, the sympathetic system also may be activated. However, by rapidly re-engaging the vagal system, mammals have the capacity to inhibit sympathetic input on the heart (Vanhoutte and Levy, 1979) and rapidly decrease metabolic output to self-soothe and calm

- First, there is a phylogenetic shift in the regulation of the heart from endocrine communication, to unmyelinated nerves, and finally to myelinated nerves
- Second, there is a development of opposing neural mechanisms of excitation and inhibition to provide rapid regulation of graded metabolic output
- Third, with increased cortical development, the cortex exhibits greater control over the brainstem via direct (e.g. corticobulbar) and indirect (e.g. corticoreticular) neural pathways originating in motor cortex and terminating in the source nuclei of the myelinated motor nerves emerging from the brainstem (e.g. specific visceral efferent nerves). 

increased neural control of the heart via a mammalian vagal system, which can promote transitory mobilization and the expression of sympathetic tone without requiring sympathetic or adrenal activation.

transitory incursions into the environment can be initiated without the severe biological cost of either metabolic shut down, via primitive vagal inhibition, or metabolic excitation, via sympathetic-adrenal activation

Paralleling this change in the neural control of the heart is an enhanced neural control of the face, larynx, and pharynx that enables complex facial gestures and vocalizations. This phylogenetic course results in greater central nervous system regulation of behavior, especially behaviors needed to engage and disengage with environmental challenges including behaviors involved in social interactions.

The mammalian autonomic nervous system retains components of three interactive, but distinct, phylogenetically dependent neural systems associated with: 
(1) the dorsal vagal complex (DVC); 
(2) the sympathetic nervous system (SNS); and 
(3) the ventral vagal complex (VVC)

Each of these three neural systems is linked with a specific emotion subsystem observable in humans. 
Each emotion subsystem carries out specific, but different adaptive functions. 

- The DVC promotes immobilization and the conservation of metabolic resources:
--{\textgreater} The DVC represents the phylogenetically oldest stage. The DVC is characterized by a primitive unmyelinated vegetative vagal system that fosters digestion and responds to novelty or threat by reducing cardiac output to protect metabolic resources. Behaviorally, the DVC is associated with the use of immobilization behaviors as an avoidance strategy

- The SNS promotes mobilization behaviors and is metabolic costly:
The SNS, the second stage, evolved as a neural regulator of metabolic output SNS can rapidly increase metabolic output and inhibit the primitive vagal system's influence on the gut to foster mobilization behaviors necessary for fight or flight.

- The VVC provides mechanisms to communicate that require minimal energy expense:
the phylogenetically most recent stage and is unique to mammals. The VVC is characterized by a myelinated vagal system that can rapidly regulate cardiac output to foster engagement and disengagement with the environment. the mammalian vagal system has an inhibitory effect on sympathetic pathways to the heart, and thus, promotes calm and prosocial behaviors.

Changes in affect regulation can be seen as an emergent property of this evolutionary trend.

Collectively, these neural pathways regulate the branchiomeric muscles and have been categorized as special visceral efferent fibers. In mammals the branchiomeric muscles control facial expression, sucking, swallowing, breathing, listening and vocalization.


VVC, by providing a voluntary system for communication and limited mobilization, serves as the neurophysiological basis for the courting behaviors associated with seduction. For example, structures related to the VVC signal availability and promote proximity.

The cortical control of the VVC is mediated by corticobulbar pathways that originate in motor areas of the frontal cortex and terminate in the nucleus ambiguus and in the source nuclei of trigeminal and facial motor pathways (Kuypers, 1958). Because the system involves and mediates voluntary actions (e.g. facial expressions, vocalizations), it has been labeled the smart vagus, in contrast to the vegetative vagus that is associated with visceral homeostasis (e.g. digestion) mediated by unmyelinated vagal fibers originating in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (Porges, 1995)

the VVC is intimately involved in the communication of affect.

Emergent Social Engagement System:
Phylogenetically, the VVC is the most recent neurophysiological affect system. The VVC is composed of a somatomotor component consisting of the special visceral efferents and a visceromotor component consisting of the myelinated vagal pathways from the nucleus ambiguus to the sinoatrial node of the heart and the bronchi.Ventral Vagal Complex

The somatomotor components of the VVC contribute to the regula- tion of behaviors involved in exploration of the social environment (e.g. looking, listening, ingesting) and behaviors involved in acknowledging social contact (e.g. facial and head gestures, vocalizing). More specifically, the somatomotor components of the VVC are involved in head turning (via cranial nerve XI), vocalizations (IX, X), facial expression (VII, V), the filtering of low frequency sounds via the middle ear muscles to extract human voice from backgrounds sounds (VII) and mastication (V). The visceromotor components of the VVC contribute to the rapid modulation of vagal (X) control of the heart and the bronchi (X), which provides metabolic resources to engage and disengage in a social setting.

First, the efferent pathways that regulate the social engagement system originate in medullary structures (i.e. nucleus of cranial nerve V, nucleus of cranial nerve VII, nucleus ambiguus)

Second, corticobulbar pathways, which originate in frontal cortex (i.e. upper motor neurons), enable the possibility of efficient cortical regulation of these medullary source nuclei (i.e. lower motor neurons).

Third, on the medullary level, the structures that regulate the efferent regulation of social-communication behaviors neuroanatomically communicate with structures that regulate ingestion (e.g. sucking, swallowing, salivation) and cardiac output.

modulation of the vagal brake may either promote calming and self-sooth- ing states (i.e. attenuate the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart) or support mobilization (i.e. potentiate the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart).

The mammalian vagus functions as an active vagal brake (Porges et al., 1996) in which rapid inhibition and disinhibition of the vagal tone to the heart can change cardiac output to promote immediate engagement and disengagement with objects and individuals

Thus, the autonomic components, coincident with social interactions, may be mediated by changes in vagal tone to the heart, rather than the assumed changes in sympathetic arousal

difficulties in regulating the vagal brake may result in the phylogenetically older systems (i.e. neural regulation of the adrenal and the sympathetic nervous system) being recruited to regulate metabolic output to deal with environmental challenges

during states of mobiliza- tion, characterized by classic ‘fight–flight' behaviors and sympathetic excitation, both the vagal brake and the behavioral components of the social engagement system are not easily accessible

monitoring dynamic changes in RSA and heart rate (i.e. the vagal brake) provides an efficient and noninvasive method of assessing the status of the social engagement system.

Courting {\&} Seduction: Specialized Functions of SES
Seduction and courting behaviors convey an invitation to reduce physical and psychological distance. Primates express this invitation via cortical regulation of the brainstem source nuclei of the VVC that control facial expressions, head movements, and vocalizations

Mammalian social behaviors appear to be an emergent property of the cortical regulation of the VVC and the peripheral structures

This cortical regulation of brainstem inhibits protective and defensive response strategies that are dependent upon subcortical structures (e.g. amygdala, hypothalamus).

When the brainstem is under subcortical control, such as in states associated with fight–flight behaviors, cardiac output is increased by activation of the sympathetic nervous system to support the mobilization behaviors necessary to avoid or to respond to potential conflict. During these states (fight/flight), cortical modulation of the visceromotor control of the heart (i.e. the vagal brake) would substan-tially reduce cardiac output and compromise the effectiveness of the adaptive fight–flight behaviors. Thus, cortical regulation of the VVC requires the setting to be perceived as safe. The perception of safety, or at least the lack of fight–flight responses, would provide a neurophysiological state in which cortical regulation of medullary nuclei could promote proximity and increase the probability of reproductive behaviors.

Love and the Polyvagal Theory
The first phase would be associated with the social engagement system, which would systematically signal and engage a prospective mate, and the regulation of vagal brake, which would modulate the metabolic resources necessary to carry out the behaviors. The first system would function only during periods of perceived safety.

The second phase would be associated with mobilization and would provide the energy, via sympathetic excitation, to defend and to facilitate proximity for reproductive behaviors when separated

However, a third phase associated with immobilization is more difficult to conceptualize within the Polyvagal Theory. Although sexual behaviors often incorporate a state of immobilization, immobilization during coitus is not consistent with the state of fear predicted by the Polyvagal Theory 

In addition, the initial description of the Polyvagal Theory made no statement regarding experiences of pleasure and ecstasy associated with sexual behavior...

A state of fear would be inconsistent with the acknowledged behavioral states associated with seduction and passion. However, for many mammals behavioral immobilization of the female is required for intromission. This active inhibition of motor activity optimally occurs in humans, not in a state of terror or fear, but in a state defined by safety and trust of the mate.

If trust and safety do not characterize the period of copulation, intercourse may be painful and produce tissue damage

How do mammals immobilize without fear? And, what are the physiological mechanisms underlying the mating rituals that allow behavioral immobilization without the physiological consequences of fear-induced shutdown responses?

The DVC, with motor fibers originating in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and afferent fibers terminating in the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema, has been assumed to be involved primarily in homeostatic functions (Leslie, 1985)

DVC promotes anabolic activities related to the restoration and conservation of bodily energy and the resting of vital organs

parallel between DVC regulation of gastrointestinal hormones and the regulation of visceral states including stress, hunger, and satiety.

Without external challenges, the DVC optimizes the function of the internal viscera. In contrast, by increasing metabolic output to deal directly with external chal- lenges, the SNS attempts to optimize the organism's relationship with the environment. Thus, increases in ambient temperature, noise, pain, and pyrogenic agents produce not only increased sympathetic activity, but an active inhibition of DVC actions on the gut (Uvnas-Moberg, 1987).



The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is an important regulator of the DVC. Neural communication between the paraventricular nucleus and the DVC is involved in responses that are not only homeostatic but protective and defensive (e.g. nausea and vomiting, conditioned taste aversion, behavioral defense)

Communication between the paraventricular nucleus and the DVC changes with experience and thus, may exhibit a type of learning or memory

The paraventricular nucleus regulation of the DVC evolved in phylogenetically older vertebrates in which escape and avoidance behaviors contributed to the maintenance of visceral homeostasis (Lawes, 1990).

Because the early vertebrates lacked an elaborate nervous system to control their viscera, behavior was a primary mechanism for the maintenance of homeostasis (e.g. moving to regulate thermoregulatory and oxygen re- quirements)

As the nervous system evolved, an autonomic nervous system and neuroen- docrine mechanisms emerged and displaced the need to use behavior to regulate internal

However, the brain structures, specifically the paraventricular nucleus, that governed the homeostatically driven behaviors in the phylogenetically older species, evolved into the structures responsible for regulating internal homeostatic functions in the phylogenetically newer species (Leslie et al., 1992).

paraventricular nucleus produces two neuropeptides, oxytocin and vasopressin, that differentially communicate with the sensory and motor portions of the DVC.

Binding sites for vasopressin are prevalent in the sensory component, but are not represented in the motor component (Fuxe, et al., 1994). In contrast, oxytocin appears to provide a primary pathway from the paraventricular nucleus to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus with oxytocin injections into the DVC mimicking the vagal responses normally observed immediately following feeding

The communication between the DVC and the paraven- tricular nucleus appears to modulate specific visceromotor reflexes involving cardiovascu- lar (Nissen et al., 1993) and gastrointestinal systems (Bray, 1985).

Oxytocin and Vasopressin: The central and systemic effects of these neuropeptides are different. 

Central release of oxytocin regulates the output of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, usually maintaining output within levels optimal to support homeostasis. Peripheral release of oxytocin is related to milk ejection, uterine contractions, and ejaculation (Arletti et al., 1992; Wakerley et al., 1994)

Central release of vasopressin appears to modulate afferent feedback from the viscera and to shift set points, independent of sensitivity, for vagal reflexes such as the baroreceptor reflex (Michelini, 1994).

abstract = {The evolution of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle to interpret the adaptive significance of physiological responses in promoting social behavior. According to the polyvagal theory, the well-documented phylogenetic shift in neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system passes through three global stages, each with an associated behavioral strategy. The first stage is characterized by a primitive unmyelinated visceral vagus that fosters digestion and responds to threat by depressing metabolic activity. Behaviorally, the first stage is associated with immobilization behaviors. The second stage is characterized by the sympathetic nervous system that is capable of increasing metabolic output and inhibiting the visceral vagus to foster mobilization behaviors necessary for 'fight or flight'. The third stage, unique to mammals, is characterized by a myelinated vagus that can rapidly regulate cardiac output to foster engagement and disengagement with the environment. The mammalian vagus is neuroanatomically linked to the cranial nerves that regulate social engagement via facial expression and vocalization. As the autonomic nervous system changed through the process of evolution, so did the interplay between the autonomic nervous system and the other physiological systems that respond to stress, including the cortex, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the neuropeptides of oxytocin and vasopressin, and the immune system. From this phylogenetic orientation, the polyvagal theory proposes a biological basis for social behavior and an intervention strategy to enhance positive social behavior. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The phylogenetic approach highlights a shift in brainstem and cranial nerve morphology, and functions from a digestive and cardiopulmonary system to a system that integrates the regulation of facial muscles, cardiac output and the vocal apparatus for affective communication:

1. Evolution has modified the structures of the autonomic nervous system.

2. The mammalian autonomic nervous system retains vestiges of phylogenetically older au- tonomic nervous systems.

3. Emotional regulation and social behavior are functional derivatives of structural changes in the autonomic nervous system due to evolu- tionary processes.

4. In mammals, the autonomic nervous system response strategy to challenge follows a phy- logenetic hierarchy, starting with the newest structures and, when all else fails, reverting to the most primitive structural system.

Such integration of work and nonwork is purported to help employees find the seemingly elusive ‘‘work-life balance.'' Scholarly investigations of this issue have increased in number, but a standard measure of work–nonwork boundary strength has yet to emerge. The purpose of this research is to explore the boundary strength construct through the process of measure validation. In Study 1, data were collected from students (N¼162) to pilot test the measure. Study 2 was a longitudinal field study in which data were collected from employees of Canadian organizations (Survey 1: N¼793; Matched data for Surveys 1 {\&} 2: N¼205). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized two-factor structure of the work–nonwork boundary strength measure, con- firming the importance of differentiating boundary strength at home (BSH) and boundary strength at work (BSW). Longitudinal analyses confirmed the structural invariance of the measure and revealed that boundary strengths are relatively stable over a period of 1 year. Role identification was related to boundary strength at home only.Weak boundaries, both at home and at work, were associated with high inter-role conflict.

annote = {positive group affective similarity and within-group relationship quality are reciprocally interrelated in the form of a self-reinforcing spiral,

driven by mechanisms of affective sharing and affective similarity-attraction between group members

Positive affect has been linked to important outcome variables such as creative problem solving, risk-taking, helping, and prosocial behavior 

Shared positive affect may play an important part in creating and maintaining group bonds, establishing close ties between group members and enhancing group processes and relationship quality (Spoor {\&} Kelly, 2004)


positive moods and emotions are increasingly considered not only on the individual level, but also as collective constructs, usually on a group level (e.g., Barsade, 2002; Barsade {\&} Gibson, 1998; Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000; George, 1990, 1996; Kelly {\&} Barsade, 2001)

Positive group affect (alternatively known as positive group affective tone) has for instance been shown to reduce absenteeism and intragroup conflict, while improving cooperation, task performance, and individual well-being (George, 1990, 1995)

work groups' positive affective similarity (i.e., the level of homogeneity of group members' positive affect) has also been argued to carry important implications (Barsade {\&} Gibson, 1998; Spoor {\&} Kelly, 2004)

Groups high on positive affective similarity have for instance been shown to exhibit higher levels of cooperativeness and lower levels of conflict than affectively heterogeneous groups (Barsade,Ward, Turner,{\&}Sonnenfeld, 2000)

various mechanisms to explain the emergence of affective similarity in
work groups, such as
- attraction–selection–attrition (George, 1990, 1996), 
- emotional contagion and comparison (Barsade, 2002), or 
- vicarious affect and intentional affective induction (Kelly {\&} Barsade, 2001)

these approaches largely remain limited to a rather static depiction of the development of group affective similarity

moods and emotions have been argued to converge between individuals over time in an interactive and dynamic manner (Anderson, Keltner, {\&} John, 2003; Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000; Totterdell, Kellett, Teuchmann, {\&} Briner, 1998)

extant theorizing has only started to touch upon these complex features of group affective similarity emergence (e.g., Kelly {\&} Barsade, 2001; Spoor {\&} Kelly, 2004).

Scholars have often found the antecedents and consequences of positive and negative affective states to be non-parallel and asymmetrical (Isen {\&} Baron, 1991; McIntyre,Watson, Clark,{\&}Cross, 1991), suggesting that positive and negative affective dynamicswill follow fundamentally different patterns (Roberts, 2006)

The Model:
positive group affective similarity is crucially driven by the quality of
within-group relationships

positive group affective similarity is also suggested to enhance the quality of such relationships in turn

reciprocal linkage between positive group affective similarity and group relationship quality will give rise to a dynamic, self-reinforcing upward spiral, with both of these constructs mutually strengthening each other over time.

external variables may influence this spiraling relationship:
- charismatic leadership,
- individuals' or subgroups' organizational cynicism, 
- group and organizational emotion norms,
- organizational identity

Operationalised:
Positive Group Affective Similarity (level of homogeneity of group members' positive affect)
group relationship quality (i.e., the extent to which group members share favorable interpersonal relations)

mechanisms underlying affective sharing: 
emotional contagion (Hatfield, Cacioppo, {\&} Rapson, 1992, 1994), 
emotional comparison (Schachter, 1959), and 
empathy (Hoffman, 1985)

Emotional contagion: a subconscious process by which people ‘(a) mimic the facial expressions, vocal expressions, and postures of those around them and (b) ‘‘catch'' others' emotions as a consequence of such facial, vocal, and postural feedback' (Hatfield et al., 1992, p. 154; see also Neumann {\&} Strack, 2000)
- Work group members may become more affectively similar by automatically imitating each others' affective expressions and subsequently (non-consciously) aligning each others' affective reactions (Barsade, 2002; Totterdell et al., 1998).

emotional comparison: a more effortful, cognitive mechanism of affective sharing (Schachter, 1959; Sullins, 1991). People in work groups thus infer the types of feelings they should experience and express from others' affective cues, becoming more affectively similar by consciously responding to such cues in a congruent manner (Barsade, 2002; Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000)

empathy: In contrast to the mechanisms described above, it is not based on contagion or comparison, but on vicarious affect, with individuals reacting emotionally responsive and deliberately assuming others' psychological point of view (Lazarus, 1991; Nelson,Klein,{\&}Irvin, 2003). In this process, work group members become more affectively similar by vicariously experiencing each others' moods and emotions (Stotland, 1969; Westman, 2001;Westman {\&} Etzion, 1999)

We propose that a high quality of interpersonal relationships within work groups promotes these mechanisms of affective sharing, thus increasing groups' level of positive affective similarity

Because they are characterized by frequent interpersonal interactions and open affective expressions among group members (Dutton{\&}Heaphy, 2003; Gittel, 2003; Levine{\&}Moreland, 1990), high-quality group relationships should provide individuals with ample opportunities to express their positive feelings.

Group members should therefore be able to easily recognize each others' positive affective expressions on a conscious or non-conscious basis, facilitating processes of emotional contagion, emotional comparison, and empathy (cf. Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000;Westman, 2001).

Bartel and Saavedra (2000) argued, individual feelings ‘that are not expressed behaviorally cannot be detected by other group members and, thus, remain private' (p. 202), diminishing the likelihood of affective convergence among group members

individuals in high-quality relationships generally exhibit strong interpersonal ties,
based for instance on trust, friendship, liking, and mutual socioemotional support (Baker, Cross, {\&} Wooten, 2003; Gittel, 2003; Ibarra{\&}Andrews, 1993). This may further strengthen affective sharing by enhancing group members' attentiveness and sensitivity towards each others' affective expressions (Dutton {\&} Heaphy, 2003).

argued to enhance individuals' susceptibility to emotional contagion (Hatfield et al., 1992)

to strengthen group members' motivation to engage in emotional comparison processes with each other (Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000)

people tend to non-consciously or consciously adjust to the moods and emotions of others with whom they feel closely connected

Liking has frequently been shown to increase individuals' willingness and ability to empathize with others (Bengtsson {\&} Johnson, 1987; McHugo, Lanzetta, Sullivan, Masters, {\&} Englis, 1985; Nelson et al., 2003; Chi {\&} Lo, 2003), contributing to the development of group members' affective similarity


Group members in such unfavorable relations are likely to avoid pronounced affective expressions (Dutton {\&} Heaphy, 2003) and to exhibit limited susceptibility to affective sharing (Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000; Bengtsson {\&} Johnson, 1987; Hatfield et al., 1992), thus inhibiting the emergence of positive group affective similarity.

Affective convergence has accordingly been shown to be particularly pronounced for cohesive work groups (Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000) and for individuals who share positive relations with other group members (Totterdell et al., 1998).

Proposition 1. Group relationship quality enhances positive group affective similarity through mechanisms of affective sharing (i.e., emotional contagion, emotional comparison, and empathy).


Positive group affective similarity enhances group relationship quality
The similarity-attraction paradigm is based on the concept of reinforcement, which suggests that social interactions may be perceived as either reinforcing (i.e., creating positive affect) or punishing (i.e., creating negative affect), with individuals being attracted to others with whom they have reinforcing interactions (Clore{\&}Byrne, 1974)

Interpersonal similarity in particular may reinforce and validate individuals' attitudes and beliefs, thus evoking positive affect and building attraction, liking, and favorable interpersonal relations (Berscheid, 1985; Williams {\&} O'Reilly, 1998).

inferred liking: Individuals may implicitly assume that similar others will like them, thus expecting favorable interactions and feeling attracted towards those others (Aronson {\&}Worchel, 1966; Condon {\&} Crano, 1988).

affect is directly linked to the psychological processes which create similarity-attraction, with interpersonal similarity resulting in positive feelings

Positive affective similarity and similarity along other dimensions (e.g., attitudinal, cognitive, or personality similarity) may therefore have comparable effects on interpersonal attraction (Barsade {\&} Gibson, 1998)

‘I feel the same way you do (i.e., upbeat and energetic), which I find reinforcing, which makes me feel good, which then makes me attracted to you, which is then reciprocated by you' (p. 805, emphasis in original)

Barsade et al. (2000): conducted the only empirical study to date
specifically investigating the impacts of work groups' positive affective similarity
They generally found positive affective similarity in these groups to enhance the quality of within-group relationships. a sample of 62 U.S. top management teams:

On the individual level, the more affectively similar a group member was to the rest of the group, the greater was his or her satisfaction with interpersonal relations. 

On the collective level, Barsade and colleagues found groups' positive affective similarity to moderate the consequences of groups' average level of positive affect.
Groups with high positive affective similarity were able to maintain high levels of cooperativeness and low levels of conflict, even if their average level of positive affect was low.
In affectively heterogeneous groups, however, low average positive affect resulted in significantly lower levels of cooperativeness and in higher levels of conflict.

Proposition 2. Positive group affective similarity enhances group relationship quality through mechanisms of affective similarity-attraction.

the dynamic interplay of the mechanisms reciprocally connecting positive group affective similarity and group relationship quality will give rise to a self-reinforcing spiral (Masuch, 1985;Weick, 1979), which we label Positive Group Affect Spiral. This spiraling process will manifest in a continuous upward movement towards greater positive affective similarity and towards increasingly favorable relationships within work groups over time (cf. Weick, 1979).

Positive emotions and workplace creativity have for instance been shown to mutually strengthen each other over time in a reciprocal, dynamic process (Amabile, Barsade, Mueller, {\&} Staw, 2005)

positive emotions may trigger upward spirals towards improved emotional well-being ‘by broadening individuals' habitual modes of thinking and action and building lasting resources that promote future experiences of positive emotions' (Fredrickson, 2003, p. 169; see also Aspinwall, 1998; Fredrickson, 2001; Fredrickson {\&} Joiner, 2002).

For instance, Quinn and Dutton (2005) noted that positive affect is often experienced collectively, with conversation partners increasingly becoming affectively synchronized as a conversation unfolds by mutually and reciprocally influencing each others' speech acts and each others' positive affective reactions

Negative affect? 
Affective sharing has been demonstrated for high-arousal negative affect (e.g., anger, fury), but there has been limited evidence for the convergence of low-arousal negative feelings (e.g., depression, sluggishness) in work groups (Barsade, 2002; Neumann {\&} Strack, 2000, experiment 1; Totterdell, 2000).

In contrast, affective similarity-attraction is more likely for low-arousal rather than high-arousal negative affect, because the latter may be perceived as socially undesirable in most situations (cf. Locke {\&} Horowitz, 1990)

The circulation of positive and negative affect may vary cross-culturally: negative affect may be more functional and distributed throughout the relations between individuals in China?? 


Proposition 3. Positive group affective similarity and group relationship quality are reciprocally and dynamically related in the form of a self-reinforcing spiral (Positive Group Affect Spiral). This Positive Group Affect Spiral results in increasing levels of both positive group affective similarity and group relationship quality over time



Contextual Variables:
external variables can only alter a self-reinforcing spiral by influencing the causal relationships between its elements as opposed to the elements themselves (Lindsley et al., 1995), that is, by impacting the mechanisms that propel the spiraling dynamics

External variables that are to effectively influence the functioning of the Positive Group Affect Spiral need to target its driving mechanisms (i.e., affective sharing and affective similarity-attraction) in order change the causal relationships between positive group affective similarity and group relationship quality and to either decelerate or accelerate the spiraling process.

Charismatic leadership
Managing subordinates' affect is often considered a crucial leadership task (Humphrey, 2002), particularly in the context of charismatic leadership (e.g., Ashkanasy {\&} Tse, 2000; Bass, 1988 Wasiliewski, 1985).

Charismatic leaders arouse followers emotionally, evoking positive affective reactions by communicating an emotionally captivating vision (McColl-Kennedy {\&} Anderson, 2002; Shamir, House, {\&} Arthur, 1993)

instill pride, faith, and respect in followers by acting as optimistic and confident role models and by emphasizing the relevance of collective (i.e., group and organizational) goals 

Such leaders harness followers' positive feelings by focusing these affective reactions on themselves (e.g., liking and admiration) or on the organization and its aspirations (e.g., enthusiasm and determination; Ashforth{\&} Humphrey, 1995; Avolio{\&}Bass, 1988; Howell{\&}Shamir, 2005).

Followers are likely to express these positive feelings in a particularly open and pronounced manner, because such expressions are positively regarded and supported by the leader

charismatic leadership may enhance the attractiveness of followers' positive affective expressions beyond the effects of mere affective similarity-attraction.

charismatic leadership has been shown to enhance groups' affective
climate (Pirola-Merlo, Hartel, Mann, {\&} Hirst, 2002)

charismatic influences need not remain limited to groups' formal leaders (Kelly
{\&} Barsade, 2001), even though higher-power individuals may be particularly likely to influence others' moods and emotions (Anderson et al., 2003)

Charisma constitutes a personal base of power which does not rely on formal, hierarchical prerequisites (House, 1991)

Largely irrespective of their hierarchical positioning, charismatic individuals have been suggested and found to influence others' affect, thus functioning as ‘mood carriers' (Totterdell et al., 1998, p. 1514) who may provoke and facilitate affective sharing and affective similarity-attraction through their engaging appeal, emotional expressiveness, and collective orientation (cf. Bono{\&}Ilies, 2006;Hatfield et al., 1992; Shamir et al., 1993)

Charismatic group membersmay thus emerge as informal leaderswith profound influences on othermembers' affect and the expressions thereof (Pescosolido, 2002), potentially shaping the functioning of the Positive Group Affect Spiral as described above

Proposition 4a. Charismatic leadership facilitates the functioning of the Positive Group Affect Spiral


Consistency of leadership and emotional neg-entropy:
leaders may find it difficult to uniformly exhibit charismatic qualities towards all of their
followers. They may share charismatic relations only with some followers but not with others, depending, for example, on leaders' efforts to treat all followers consistently and on individual followers' skill, values, and orientations (Klein {\&} House, 1995)

For instance, mechanisms of affective sharing may suffer from leaders' unequal treatment of their followers, as only some followers have favorable, charismatic relations with the leader while others do not. Such inconsistency in charismatic leadership may diminish the quality of work groups' social environments and decrease followers' well-being, commitment, and morale (Bliese {\&} Britt, 2001; Bliese {\&} Halverson, 1998; Cole {\&} Bedeian, 2007).

‘[w]hen followers are divided in their loyalty and enthusiasm for a common leader but must work closely together, intragroup conflict and resentment appear likely' (p. 192–193; see also Dansereau, Graen, {\&} Haga, 1975; Graen{\&}Uhl-Bien, 1995)

Leaders' differential treatment of their followers may clearly emphasize interpersonal dissimilarities (e.g., rendering some group members ‘second-class followers'; Klein {\&} House, 1995, p. 192), diminishing the salience of transient affective reactions for producing similarity-attraction effects

Also, those group members who do not share charismatic relations with the leader may find little appeal in his or her vision (Waldman{\&}Yammarino, 1999)

Proposition 4b. Inconsistency in charismatic leadership towards group members diminishes, while consistency in charismatic leadership facilitates the functioning of the Positive Group Affect Spiral.


Individuals' and subgroups' organizational cynicism:
Positive Group Affect Spiral may be impaired by the presence of subgroups or single group members who induce pronounced negativity in an otherwise positive group (interrupt forward flow/momentum of the group story)

pronouncedly negative attitude towards one's employing organization, comprising the belief that the organization lacks integrity, strong negative feelings towards the organization (e.g., anger, contempt, and distress), and a tendency for negative, disparaging behaviors towards the organization (Dean, Brandes,{\&}Dharwadkar, 1998)

overly critical attitudes towards co-workers, emphasizing their own alleged moral superiority (Abraham, 2000)

Groupmembers' susceptibility to emotional contagion, emotional comparison, and empathy may suffer, as they become less likely to consciously or non-consciously perceive each others' affective expressions (cf. Bartel{\&}Saavedra, 2000; Erickson, 1988). Similarly, as indicated above, interpersonal conflicts have been shown to also reduce such mechanisms of affective sharing (Bengtsson {\&} Johnson, 1987; Erickson, 1988; Hatfield et al., 1992).

Proposition 5. Single group members' or subgroups' organizational cynicism diminishes the functioning of the Positive Group Affect Spiral.


Group and organizational emotion norms:
Emotion norms cover both feeling rules (specifying how individuals should feel in specific situations; Hochschild, 1979) and display rules (specifying how individuals should express their feelings; Rafaeli {\&} Sutton, 1989). Such norms may either be formalized (e.g., through training programs) or emerge from informal interactions among co-workers (Bartel {\&} Saavedra, 2000), and they may originate from both the group and the organizational level (Kelly {\&} Barsade, 2001)

Such norms may urge employees to either suppress positive affective states and expressions (emphasizing for instance rationality instead of emotionality; cf. Putnam {\&} Mumby, 1993) or to deliberately experience and express positive feelings (Ashforth {\&} Humphrey, 1995). 

If such norms favor the experience and expression of positive affect, employees may be encouraged to openly and distinctly display their positive feelings, as such behavior is socially desired and potentially sanctioned by other group members and the organization

In contrast, norms that devalue positive affective experiences and displays and encourage affective neutrality are likely to reduce the strength and distinctiveness of group members' positive affective expressions and to diminish the attractiveness of such displays (Ashforth {\&} Humphrey, 1995), thus impeding mechanisms of affective sharing and affective similarity-attraction and restrain},

Using videotapes and written transcripts, an analysis of the groups' working processes was undertaken using Sawyer's pre-existing structures required for the presence of group flow, and Davis and Simmt's conditions for complex systems. It is suggested that although both groups had the prerequisite structures in place to experience group flow, the second group was not decentralized enough to enable all members to establish a working collaborative proximal zone of development in which they could develop their ideas as a collective, while the first group was sufficiently decentralized and appeared to demonstrate episodes of experiencing group flow. If teachers are aware of conditions that encourage the experience of group flow, this may help them in forming productive small groups within the classroom and developing successful group-oriented learning tasks. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@phdthesis{Stephens2010,
abstract = {Organizing involves unifying the work of many into the work of a whole group or organization. This occurs through the continuously adaptive performance of coordination by individuals within a group. Although how individuals act on behalf of the group is shaped by what is perceived by their minds and senses, we know little about what group members focus on and feel while coordinating. Two studies examined individual attention and feeling in groups coordinating their efforts to make music. I chose group music-making as a setting to explore these issues because it exhibits attention and feeling in uniquely observable ways. In Study 1, I used a four-group experimental design to study how a focus on attention to self, to other and to the self-in-relation-to-other affected the quality of coordination for individuals performing a group song-composition task. In Study 2, I used the ethnographic methods of participant-observation and qualitative interviewing to examine the primacy of feelings or aesthetics in how individuals coordinate sounds as they sing as a choir. Both studies revealed that individuals coordinate with others based on their perceptions of either "parts" or "wholes" through attention and feeling. Experimental groups in which members displayed more attention to others in relation to attention to the self were more responsive than groups in which members displayed more attention to the self. Groups with more responsive members were judged to have higher coordination quality, and reported more feelings of the group working as a substantive whole. The experiences of singing as a choir revealed that performers use the aesthetic or feeling of beauty, as well as attention, to coordinate. Performers know whether to maintain or adjust their efforts based on experiencing the desirable, beautiful cohesive whole of a fine performance (high quality coordination), or the discomforting, poor-quality fragmentation of a poor performance (low quality coordination). The choir's conductor also shaped both performers' attentional focus and use of beauty as a standard for coordination. Together, the studies reveal how the work of individuals is at once the work of the group, and how both cognitive and aesthetic knowledge shape coordination.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to extend the Channel Model of Flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975, 1990) at the collective level (workgroups) by including collective efficacy beliefs as a predictor of collective flow based on the Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997, 2001). A two-wave longitudinal lab study was conducted with 250 participants working in 52 small groups. Longitudinal results from Structural Equation Modeling with data aggregated at the group level showed, as expected, that collective efficacy beliefs predict collective flow over time, both being related reciprocally. Findings and their theoretical and practical implications in the light of Social Cognitive Theory are discussed.},
annote = {Take Aways:

Findings show the superiority of collective efficacy beliefs in their prediction of collective flow over time. And, interestingly, a feeling of collective flow at the group level also predicts how efficacious the group will feel over time (Immersion - SB)




collective efficacy to mean “a group's shared belief in its conjoint capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given levels of attainments” (Bandura, 1997, p. 447)

“minds of the individual members who make up the group are the locus of collective efficacy assessment” (Stajkovic, Lee, {\&} Nyberg, 2009, p. 815), and, as a result, the aggregation of individual assessment to evaluate collective efficacy becomes the method preferred by Bandura (1997)


Hirschfeld and Bernerth (2008), team potency “is a team's perception of its ca- pability to perform well across various tasks”, while team efficacy (collective efficacy in our study) “is a team's perception of its capability to perform well on a given task” (p. 1429). Their outcomes are also different. According to a meta-analysis performed by Stajkovic et al. (2009), collective efficacy fully mediates the relationship between group potency and group performance



one of the conditions that Walker (2010) found in his studies was that “the collective competency of the group is sufficient to dispatch challenge, and group members have task-relevant knowledge {\&} skills about each other”

shared beliefs in their collective power
to produce the desired results (collective efficacy beliefs) could influence the way people in groups perceive challenges, according to their group skills, and could in turn lead people in groups to experience collective positive experiences such as collective flow or co-flo.

Research at the individual level of analysis has found that students with high self-efficacy beliefs spent more time on learning activities and they experienced more flow than those with low self-efficacy beliefs (Bassi, Steca, Delle Fave, {\&} Caprara, 2007)
Salanova et al. (2006) found inwork settings that self-efficacy beliefs had a positive reciprocal influence on flow among teachers over time


Affect and Flow:
Considering the affective component of flow, the psychological mechanism underlying this process remains clear from the Social Cognitive Theory: “Moods states can bias attention and affect how events are interpreted, cognitively organised, and retrieved from memory” (Bandura, 1997, p. 111).

In this sense, peoplemake positive evaluative judgments when they are in good mood (i.e., flow in our case) and negative ones when they are in bad moods. Then, the role of positive affect (one of the components of flow, such as enjoyment) is clearly a key role when predicting efficacy beliefs.

perceived challenges and skills seems to be an antecedent or necessary prerequisite of the flow experience (Nakamura {\&}Csikszentmihalyi, 2002)
situational conditions (i.e., clear goals and immediate feedback) and also personal conditions (i.e., efficacy beliefs) are important antecedents that can enhance flow (Bassi et al., 2007; Salanova et al., 2006; Sawyer, 2003;Walker, 2010)

Group Flow:
Walter and Bruch (2008) argued in favor of the existence of a reciprocal linkage between positive group affective similarity and group relationship quality, which gives rise to a dynamic, self-reinforcing upward spiral that they called the positive group affect spiral

Hypothesis 1: The extended channel model, which includes collective efficacy beliefs as a predictor of collective flow experiences, fits the data better than the original channel model.

Hypothesis 2: Collective efficacy and collective flow are indirectly related through the combination of collective challenges and skills over time. The more collective efficacy there is, the higher the combination of challenges and skills will be and so the higher flow will be over time.

Hypothesis 3: Collective efficacy beliefs and collective flow are reciprocally related in a kind of virtuous cycle over time; that is, the more collective efficacy there is at T1, the more collective flow experiences there will be at T2, and vice versa


Study:
The main objective of this service was to develop and promote a cre- ative project about socio-cultural activities:

the group had to carry out three creative tasks: First, the group had to develop the official program for the so-called Cultural EventWeek at the university (Task 0). Second, they had to develop the timetable for that particular week (Task 1) and, finally, they had to design the posters that would be used to promote theCultural EventsWeek (Task 2)

After finishing tasks 1 and 2, participants filled in a self-report questionnaire with the study variables

Collective Efficacy Beliefs:
averaging individuals' own
perceptions of collective efficacy, as recommended by Earley (1993) using the scale developed by Salanova, Llorens, Cifre,Mart´ınez, and Schaufeli (2003)
- scale consisted of five items ranging from 0 (“never”) to 6 (“always”).An example of these items is “I feel confident about the capability of my group to perform this task very well.”

Collective flow experience was considered a latent factor with two indicators:
a group task absorption scale made up of 6 items (Salanova et al., 2003) and a group task enjoyment scale (two self-constructed items adapted to the laboratory task). An example of a group task absorption item is “When the group is working, we forget everything else around us” and an example item referring to group task enjoyment is: “The group members enjoy themselves while doing the task.”

The group task absorption scale includes aspects of collective flow experience, such as high attention to group members, loss of sense of time, less awareness of self, surrender of self to group, looking for new perspectives, and so forth (Salanova et al., 2003)

How often they experienced absorption and enjoyment with the group task was indicated on a seven-point frequency rating scale ranging from 0 (“never”) to 6 (“all the time”)

group challenge and group skills as a multiplicative composite with two self-constructed items: challenge that the group task implied for group members (“Towhat extent has this task had been a challenging task for the group?”) and skills that the group perceived they had that allow them to cope with the tasks (“To what extent did the group feel skilled to perform this specific task?”). 

It is important to notice that the balance between challenge and skills is relevant to this composite, but it should also be noted that both challenges and skills need to be at a moderate to high level (seeMassimini {\&} Carli, 1988).


Results:
results confirm Hypothesis 1,wherewe expected the Extended Channel
Model (which also included collective efficacy as a predictor of collective flow experience) to show a better fit to the data than the Original Channel Model (which only included the combination of challenges X skills)
the relevance of the causal cross-lagged path from T1 collective efficacy beliefs to T2 collective flow, and also the reverse path from T1 collective flow to collective efficacy at T2.

However, results only partially confirmed Hypothesis 2, since collective efficacy atT1 led directly to collectiveflowatT1and at T2, and indirectly through the combination of collective challenges X skills, but only at T1

results confirmed the synchronic as well as the longitudinal relationships between collective efficacy beliefs and collective flow. However, the relationship between the combination of collective challenges X skills and collective flow was not significant over time due to only synchronic relationships were found (in T1 and in T2)

Discussion:
Hypothesis 1, which assumed that the fit of the Extended Channel Model is superior to that of the Original Channel Model, was confirmed. But Hypotheses 2 and 3,which both refer to the virtuous cycle over time, were only partially confirmed, since results showed that the relationship between collective efficacy beliefs and collective flow was synchronic and cross-lagged (in the sense of a reciprocal influence), whereas the relationship between the combination of collective challenges X skills and collective flow was not confirmed over time.

Findings show the superiority of collective efficacy beliefs in their prediction of collective flow over time. And, interestingly, a feeling of collective flow at the group level also predicts how efficacious the group will feel over time

And, second, groups with high collective efficacy beliefs perceive more challenges immediately and feel more competent (skilled), which in turn has an impact on synchronic collective flow experiences.

the positive experience of collective flow at T1 is positively related to collective efficacy at T2. As Bandura (1997) concluded, “ ...mood and efficacy beliefs are related both concurrently and predictively” (p. 113)

that the combination of challenges X skills is always a prerequisite of the immediate flow experience, since it is closely related to the specific task at hand

In sum, including efficacy beliefs in the Channel Model is indeed a step forward, which Bassi et al. (2007) also began to develop. The combination of So- cial Cognitive Theory and the Channel Model has proved that the more complete model including collective efficacy is better at explaining the optimal experiences in groups, especially over time

should be considered as something more than the sum of individuals' flow experiences},

abstract = {The theory of flow argues that subjective well-being results from absorption in an activity that strikes a good balance between challenges and skills. This absorption has been termed flow. Such absorption is often reported in combat situations, in which it contributes both to the subjective well-being and to the efficiency of soldiers.

The study of combat flow could therefore shed new light on military history and form the basis for the development of new training techniques. The article simultaneously probes the ethical and political implications of manipulating the subjective well-being of soldiers in such a way. It cautions scholars of flow and subjective well-being that they should be aware of the ethical and political implications of their studies and warns against the dangerous political results of equating subjective well-being with happiness. The article further calls for greater cooperation between psychologists and historians in the study of well-being.},

abstract = {This article focuses on emergence in social systems. The author begins by proposing a new tool to explore the mechanisms of social emergence: multi-agent–based computer simulation. He then draws on philosophy of mind to develop an account of social emergence that raises potential problems for the methodological individualism of both social mechanism and of multi agent simulation. He then draws on various complexity concepts to propose a set of criteria whereby one can determine whether a given social mechanism generates emergent properties, in the sense that their explanation cannot be reduced to a mechanistic account of individuals and their interactions. This combined account helps to resolve the competing claims of methodological individualists and social realists. The author's conclusion is that the scope of mechanistic explanation may be limited due to the extreme complexity of many social systems.},

But if the disjunctive lower-level realizations are not lawfully related, then macrosocial laws are irreducible because of the way the world is put together: not all social properties correspond to a single mechanistic description in terms of individuals and their relations (cf. Fodor 1974, 131).

draws on various complexity concepts to propose a set of criteria whereby one can determine whether a given social mechanism generates emergent properties, in the sense that their explanation cannot be reducedtoa mechanistic account of individuals and their interactions

scope of mechanistic explanation may be limited due to the extreme complexity of many social systems.

Certainly by “mecha- nism,” these philosophers do not mean that they believe that their systems were consciously designed and built, like the clockwork mechanisms of the 18th-century; most of what arenowcalled mechannisms are not mechanical.

Philosophers of both biology and social science retain the belief that these systemswere not consciously designed but devel- oped through some sort of emergent, undirected process.

Bunge's usage of the term “mechanism” was consistent with the traditional 19th-century notion of mechanism as atomistic reduction (e.g., 1969/ 1973, 1977). By 1996, he was using the term “mechanism” in his cur- rent manner, as a form of explanation contrasted with empiricism (1996, 137-42; 1997, 414-20).


most social mechanists deny that social prop- erties are real. This denial is implicit throughout their writings: for example,“A‘class' cannot be a causal agent because it is nothing but a constructed aggregation of occupational titles” (Hedstr{\"{o}}m and Swedberg 1998, 11; also see Abbott 1996, 3). Whereas SM realism focuses on the mechanisms that realize emergent system properties, I argue for a realism about those properties themselves; and I argue that once social properties emerge, they have an ontological status distinct from their realizing mechanisms and may participate in causal relations.

MICRO-SOCIOLOGY AND MECHANISM:
Predating this recent philosophical interest in mechanism, many
microsociologists have argued that macro social properties can only be explained in terms of the mechanics of the relationships between individuals

In process theory, the preference for mechanistic, generative explanation is driven generally by the rejection of covering law models of science but more specifically by the perceived failure of sociology to identify lawful regularities in social systems (e.g., Giddens 1984).

(law versus mechanism)

Many process theorists emphasize the importance of building theoreticalmod- els in which the components are often unobservable and must be hypothesized by the researcher (Barth 1981; Harr{\'{e}} 1970; Miller 1987)

presenting a version of social science that is opposed to empiricist, deductive-nomological approaches

ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES: SIMULATING THE MECHANISMS OF EMERGENCE Since the mid-1990s, process and mechanism have been increasingly central in the study of complexity

multi agent systems: contains many autonomous computational agents that negotiate and collaborate with each other, in a distributed, self-organizing fashion

1. models of individual agents
2. model of communication language, and 
3. model of network connections between individuals

The scientific realist foundations of this approach are strongly implicit among such researchers (Cederman 2002; Epstein 1999)

Artificial societies are mechanistic in the contemporary sense.
Theyare also firmly methodologically individualist. Artificial society models represent a shift from equation-based modeling to agent- based modeling(MacyandWiller 2002; Sawyer2003a; andthis is con- sistent with Hedstr{\"{o}}mand Swedberg 1998, 15-17). However, philoso- phers of social science who advocate a mechanistic understanding of social systems rarely ground their arguments in contemporary complexity science.

“individualism is incapable of accounting for the emergence ...of social systems” (p. 256),whenindividualists from Menger and Hayek to Homans and Coleman viewed exactly this task as their primary goal. All intellectually interesting variants of MI accept that social bonds, social systems, and emergent properties exist, yet they argue that scientific explanation must proceed by reducing these to explanations in terms of individuals in networks of relations

it is possible that social laws may exist that are difficult to explain by reduction to micro mechanisms

Bunge has often described his systemism as the position that studied not only in isolation but also to see how their behavior changes when in rela- tions with other parts in complex systems

I argue that some emergent social properties may be real, and may have autonomous causal powers, just like real properties at any other level of analysis

SM explanation maybe limited to the explanation of individual cases that do not generalize widely, resulting in an interpretivist or case study approach rather than a science of generalizable laws and theories

Many sociological theorists use the philosophical notion of emergence to argue that collective phenomena are collaboratively created by individuals yet are not reducible to individual action (Sawyer 2001).

In the social sciences,emergence refers to processes and mechanisms of the micro-to-macro transition

nonreductive individualism (NRI)
NRI holds to a form of property dualism in which social properties may be irreducible to individual properties, even though social entities con- sist of nothingmore thanmechanismscomposedof individuals

NRI uses notions of supervenience, multiple realizability, and wild disjunction to argue that the relation between emergent social properties and their realizing mechanisms is one of token identity but not of type identity

In other words, on any token occasion, a social property must be realized by a mechanism involving its components individuals (or more broadly, in Bunge's (2004) terms, realized in a system defined as a CESMquadruple)

on different occasions, the same social property might be realized by different mechanisms (multiple realizability), and those different mechanisms might not be similar in any sociologically meaningful way (wild disjunction)

Supervenience
if a collection of individuals with distinct properties organized into a system operating according to distinct mechanisms causes a certain social property to obtain on one occa- sion, then that same collection of individuals in that same set of sys- temic relations operating according to the same mechanisms on another occasion will cause the same social property to obtain (Kim 1997, 188). 

every social property must be “realized” or “imple- mented” in some system of individuals and every social property emerges froma mechanism describable in terms of that system. Yet it does not entail MI due to multiple realizability (Heil 1998, 1999).

Multiple Realizability
version of supervenience that argues that the reductionist approach of MIis not possible for somesocial properties 

The argument that convinced most philosophers of mind that mental properties could not be reduced to physical properties was Putnam and Fodor's multiple realizability argument (Fodor 1974; Putnam 1967); nonreduction due to multiple realizability is now the consensus position in the philosophy of mind (Block 1997; Heil 1999)

Social properties are multiply realizable at the individual level (cf. Kincaid 1997, 17-20)

For example, properties of groups like “being a church” or “having an argument” can be realized by a wide range of organizational structures, cultural practices, interactional patterns, and individual beliefs and dispositions

SM attempts to explain group properties by identifying their realizing mechanisms...

So...

If a group property is multiply realized, then there may be many mechanisms that realize it, a different one for each token instance

For example, it claims that one can identify a mechanism for the social property “having an argument” such that all possible realizations of this property can be described in systemic terms

But if all of the different realizing mechanisms of a social property are meaningfully related, then a broader mechanistic explanation could still be considered to have reductively explained the social property. MI would only be false if the realizing mechanisms were not meaningfully related.

Sawyer (2002b) showed that a social property might be multiply realized in different systems that are not meaningfully related, using Fodor's (1974) term wild disjunction for such higher-level properties.

If the different realizing mechanisms are not meaningfully related, then the mecha- nistic, methodologically individualist approach would have limited explanatory power for that social property; an identification of the mechanism on one occasion would indeed provide an explanation of how that social property emerged on that occasion, but the explana- tion would not extend to the other realizing mechanisms contained within that same social property

Together, multiple realization and wild disjunction provide an argument for social realism and against MI

MI could explain a social property only if the wildly disjunctive realizations at the individual levelhadlawful correspondences to theemergent social property

But if the disjunctive lower-level realizations are not lawfully related, then macrosocial laws are irreducible because of the way the world is put together: not all social properties correspond to a single mecha- nistic description in terms of individuals and their relations (cf. Fodor 1974, 131).



WHICH SOCIAL PROPERTIES ARE EMERGENT? LESSONS FROM COMPLEX SYSTEMS THEORY

some social properties may participate in causal laws even though they cannot be reductively explained in terms of their lower-level realizing mechanisms. Such irreducible macroproperties engage in macro-to-micro causal relations that have been called downward causation (Sawyer 2003d) or situational mechanisms (Hedstr{\"{o}}m and Swedberg 1998)

NRI is compatible with the existence of irreducible higher level causal laws; I refer to this as supervenient causation

Whether or not a social property is emergent—in the sense that it is
multiple realized in wildly disjunctive sets of lower-level mecha- nisms—can only be determined empirically (Fodor 1974)

If we grant to individualism higher-level social proper- ties are not ontologically autonomous, but are supervenient on disjunctions of realizing mechanisms, then the individualist could respond that this seems compatible with MI.

I provide a framework that helps us to determine which properties are likely to submit to methodologically individualist reduction—such that “explanation” consists of describ- ing the realizing system and its associated mechanisms—and which properties are not

for certain social mechanisms, we may be required to pursue macrosociological explanation in terms ofemergent social properties, not only because of epistemological limits to current science but because of the structure of reality

wild disjunction is a derivative property of complexity and that reductionism will fail for systems that cross some minimum threshold of complexity.

Number of Units:
as the number of component units increases, the likelihood of emer- gent higher-level properties increases
The human brain contains around 100 billion neurons, and this large number has contributed to claims that the mind is a complex system that generates irreducibly emergent macro properties
The largest modern human societies contain several hundred million units (individuals), and they are highly interconnected

Nonaggregativity:
Wimsatt (1986) equated emergence with nonaggregativity. Most social properties are not aggregative and thus are emergent

Aggregative properties meet four criteria, and most social properties do not satisfy them:
1. the system property is not a product of the way the system is organized; the parts are intersubstitutable without affecting the system property
In social systems, individualists and collectivists alike agree that individuals and subsystems are not intersubstitutable because the network of relationships between individuals is significant
2. an aggregative property should remain qualitatively similar under addition or removal of a part from the system
3. the composition function for the property remains invariant under operations of decomposition and reaggregation of parts
for example, many social movements manifest threshold phenomena such that the addition or removal of the Nth individual may result in a qualitative change in the system, even though individuals N-1 and before did not.
4. Fourth, there are no cooperative or inhibitory interactions among the parts; thus, the relation between parts and whole is linear (Bechtel and Richardson 1993, 266)
Again, individualists and collectivists agree that this condition does not hold of most social systems, because relationships between individuals are often cooperative or inhibitory.

in Wimsatt's (1986) account, a property could be nonaggregative and nonetheless be reducible, even for nonaggregative properties, there must exist some composition function that relates the emergent property to a decomposition of the system into parts with relationships


Near Decomposability
- Decomposable systems are modular, with each component acting primarily according to its own intrinsic principles
- Each component is influenced by the others only at its inputs; its function (processing of those inputs) is not itself influenced by other components (Simon 1969)
- the behavior of any part is intrinsically determined: it is possible to determine the component's properties in isola0tion from the other components, despite the fact that they interact
- The organization of the entire system is critical for the function of the system as a whole, but that organization does not provide constraints on the internal functioning of components

In contrast, in nondecomposable systems, the overall system orga-
nization is a significant influence on the function of any component; thus, component function is no longer intrinsically determined. De- pendence of components on each other is often mutual andmayeven make it difficult to draw firm boundaries between components (Bechtel and Richardson 1993, 26-27).

Systems that are not nearly decomposable are likely to have emergent system properties that are wildly disjunctive at the level of description of the components, and such systems are thus less likely to submit to mechanist explanation

(Social systems properties are not too disjunctive from their componentry)

Localization 
A system is localizable if the functional decomposition of the system corresponds to its physical decomposition and each property of the system can be identified with a single component or subsystem

If social properties cannot be identified with components, but are
instead distributed within the system, that system is not localizable (Bechtel and Richardson 1993, 24).

Many social properties are not localizable. For example, “being a church” cannot be localized to any of the individuals belonging to the church or to any subnetwork of those individuals

The brain is generally agreed to be nonlocalizable in this sense,and
much of the theory about localizability has been inspired by connectionist models of brain function in cognitive science

social systems with a high dynamic density are less likely to be decomposable or localizable and as such are more likely to manifest social properties that are wildly disjunctive at the individual level of description. In modern societies, dynamic density increases as com- munication and transportation technology advance, increasing the
number and frequency of network connections among individuals (cf. Durkheim 1895/1964, 114-15; Sawyer 2002a).


Complexity of Communication
interaction between components is central to micro-macro process accounts.

In complexity theory, the above criteria of nonaggregativity, non- decomposability, and nonlocalizability are all defined in terms of the complex systemic relations among components

several complexity theorists have suggested that the complexity of each interaction between components may be another variable contribut- ing to emergence (Baas 1994; Darley 1994; Sawyer 2003c).

Artificial society theorists have proposed that as the communication language between agents becomes more complex, the likelihood of irreducible macropatternsemerging increases (Sawyer 2003b)

The extreme complexity of human symbolic interaction thus contributes to the irreducibility of social properties...

complex dynamical systems models tend to assume extremelysimple interactions.Yetalthoughhumancommunicationis qualitatively more complex, emergentists have not connected their theories to the study of symbolic interaction in groups. If there is a qualitative difference in the complexity of this communication and that in natural complex systems, then social theories of emergence may need to incorporate a theory of symbolic interaction (cf. Sawyer 2003b)


Nonlinearity
In nonlinear systems, the effect may not be proportional to the cause; a small change in initial conditions can lead to a radical change in the later state of thesystem—theso-called butterfly effect— or inversely, a large change in initial conditions might not lead to any significant change in the later state of the system

Systems described by chaotic equations are often observed to possess attractors, relatively steady states that the system tends to gravitate towards. Chaos theorists argue that the reductive methods of traditional science are difficult to apply to such systems because many of the mathematical tools used in traditional science were developed for linear systems and are not applicable to nonlinear systems (Casti 1994)

Gell-Mann (1994, 111) argued that in chaotic systems, reduction to
explanation in terms of components is practically impossible although possible in principle (also see Baas 1994, 519)

complexity theorists argue that nonlinearity makes explanation by reduction to realizing mechanism impossible.

Open and Closed Systems
Open systems are systems in which energy, information, or matter flows between the system and its environment. 

Many theorists argue that earlier versions of cybernetics-derived theory are only appropriate for closed systems
- A common citation in this context is the work of Nobel-prize-winning physicist Ilya Prigogine on dissipative structures, systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium (Nicolis and Prigogine 1977; Prigogine and Stengers 1984)

- the B{\'{e}}nard convection cell: These cells form when a layer of liquid is heated from below; at a given temperature, the heated molecules at the bottom of the layer start to rise, and the cooler ones on top start to sink. If the temperature is too high, the liq- uid reaches a turbulent state withoutany regular, stable structure; but at just the right temperature, the flow between the top and bottom of the liquid results in the emergence of regular, stable patterns known as B{\'{e}}nardcells, typically with a hexagonal shape, with the hotter fluid risingupthe center of the cellandthe cooler fluid sinking at the edges...

Although a system in this state is quite chaotic, and individual particles are moving rapidly, the cells remain remarkably stable. This is an open system because it requires the application of an external heat source to occur

In fact, it is generally thought that the structures of open, nonequilibrium many-particle systems are more complex than the structures found in systems at equilibrium

Sociologists generally accept that social systems are open (McIntyre 1996; Parsons 1970): “the strong emphasis in modern biological thinking that living systems are open systems, engaged},

Nonetheless, there is no theoretical model that explains the development of work engagement in teams that takes into consideration what is already known about team dynamics and processes. This study addresses this gap in the literature, presenting a model for the emergence of team work engagement. The model proposes team inputs, outputs, and mediators as predictors of team work engagement and highlights their recursive influences over time. This conceptual work provides a starting point for further research on team work engagement, allowing for distinguishing individual and team constructs.},
annote = {at the team level, work engagement has positive relationships with task and team performance, collective positive affect, and efficacy beliefs. Team work engagement is also positively related to individual work engagement.

Torrente et al. (2012b) that proposes team social resources (supportive team climate, team work and coordination) as possible antecedents of team work engagement

Studies using this model have shown that job demands and resources trigger two different psychological processes that are the roots of work engagement and burnout: an energy impairment process caused by excessive job demands and a positive motivational process that is triggered by job resources

Work Engagement:
Job resources such as performance feedback, job control/ autonomy, and supervisory support are then conceptualized as the major antecedents of work engagement (Hakanen, Bakker, {\&} Schaufeli, 2006; Richardsen, Burke, {\&} Martinus- sen, 2006; Schaufeli{\&}Bakker, 2004), and they appear to enhance engagement especially when job demands are high (Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, {\&} Xanthopoulou, 2007)

personal resources have also been found to predict work engagement (Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, {\&} Schaufeli, 2007) personality traits, such as high extraversion and low neuroticism (Langelaan, Bakker, Schaufeli, {\&} Van Doornen, 2006), and lower-order personality characteristics including self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience


Team Work Engagement:
Teams are ‘a distinguishable set of two or more people who interact, dynamically, interdependently, and adaptively towards a common and valued goal/objective/mission, who have been assigned specific roles or functions to perform, and who have a limited lifespan of membership' (Salas, Dickinson, Converse, {\&} Tannenbaum, 1992, p. 4)

and every member has a critical role for their collective action. Consequently, the success of teams is dependent on the way team members interact with each other to accomplish the work (Marks, Mathieu, {\&} Zaccaro, 2001)

team work engagement, as a collective construct, is dependent on the individual actions and cycles of interaction responsible for creating a shared pattern of behaviour (Morgeson {\&} Hofmann, 1999)

Therefore, with the same resources and in an equally challengingenvironment,someteams might develop a higher level ofengagement than others, because the affective, cognitive, and motivational outcomes of different patterns of interaction are likely to be different

Bakker, Albrecht, and Leiter (2011) propose that collective engagement refers to the engagement of the team/group (team vigour, team dedication, and team absorption), as perceived by individual employees and that it might exist due to emotional contagion (Hatfield et al., 1994) among teammembers.},

abstract = {This review identifies the defining features of rituals and their functions in organiza- tions, culminating in two key claims. First, organizational rituals can be described on a spectrum based on the fullness and degree of their expression. Complete or ‘full' organizational rituals possess a greater number and intensity of ritual features than ‘ritual-like' activities. The efficacy of an activity corresponds to its alignment with the features of full rituals. Ritual-like activities are therefore less powerful and more frequent organizational events than full rituals. Second, it is theorized that ritualswork through three mutually reinforcing mechanisms: cognitive capture, emotional anchor- ing and behavioural prescription. It is proposed that rituals work by channelling (1) cognitive content, (2) affective responses and (3) behavioural activity toward the cul- tural expectations of organizations and their members. Organizational rituals may be characterized as standardized, rule-bound, predictable and repetitive behaviours undertaken in conditions demanding explicit performance expectations. Rituals are physically enacted to conform to a specified and invariable sequence, and are invested with added significance through a combination of formality and symbolism. Nine inter-dependent functions of rituals are specified,which are to: (1) provide meaning; (2) manage anxiety; (3) exemplify and reinforce the social order; (4) communicate impor- tant values; (5) enhance group solidarity; (6) include and exclude others; (7) signal commitment; (8) manage work structure; and (9) prescribe and reinforce significant events. These functions underline the role that rituals play as communication and learning systems, drawing attention to what is important and helping to funnel the thoughts, feelings and behaviours of organizational members. Organizational rituals are particularly important because they not only illuminate organizational behaviour, but also entrench or challenge existing cultural values. Introduction Rituals represent an integral part of everyday life, and range from repetitive behaviours associated with obsessive-compulsive disorders, to the mimicking of adults practised by children during play (Boyer and Lienard 2006). The labels attached to these activities vary considerably.Goffman (1967) considered rituals to be patterned behaviour in the context of social enhancement or diminishment, while Durkheim (1961) viewed rituals as social instruments used to establish collective representations and community identity. It is commonly assumed that, while rituals often exaggerate reality, they also contain purposive behaviour},

Self-efficacy was assessed at 4 time points: before entry into the experimental condition, pre-exercise, postexercise, and 20 min postexercise. Results revealed that self-efficacy did not significantly change following exercise or recovery in the no mirror condition. However, the mirror condition resulted in moderate increases in self-efficacy postexercise and large increases following recovery.

abstract = {Although exercise is known to promote mental health, a satisfactory understanding of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not yet been achieved. A new mechanism is proposed that is based on established concepts in cognitive psychology and the neurosciences as well as recent empirical work on the functional neuroanatomy of higher mental processes. Building on the fundamental principle that processing in the brain is competitive and the fact that the brain has finite metabolic resources, the transient hypofrontality hypothesis suggests that during exercise the extensive neural activation required to run motor patterns, assimilate sensory inputs, and coordinate autonomic regulation results in a concomitant transient decrease of neural activity in brain structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, that are not pertinent to performing the exercise. An exercise-induced state of frontal hypofunction can provide a coherent account of the influences of exercise on emotion and cognition. The new hypothesis is proposed primarily on the strength of its heuristic value, as it suggests several new avenues of research. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Individuals with schizophrenia experience a range of cognitive deficits and associated dysfunctions in the neural systems that support cognitive processes. This chapter reviews the literature on disturbances in working memory, executive control, and episodic memory in schizophrenia. Advances in basic cognitive neuroscience are described to help explain the cognitive neuroscience of schizophrenia. For working memory in schizophrenia, evidence is reviewed regarding deficits in the verbal (phonological loop) and nonverbal (visual-spatial scratch pad) buffer systems as well as in the central executive function. In the domain of episodic memory, evidence is reviewed for deficits in recollection versus familiarity processes in episodic memory. Also discussed are conceptual issues and potential confounds relevant to understanding the cognitive neuroscience of schizophrenia, including the role that cognitive deficits play in the developmental course of schizophrenia, relationships to specific symptom domains, behavioral performance confounds, and medication influences on behavioral performance and brain function.},

abstract = {A dilemma in functional neuroimaging is that immobilization of the subject, necessary to avoid movement artifact, extinguishes all but the simplest behaviors. Recently, we developed an implantable microbolus infusion pump (MIP) that allows bolus injection of radiotracers by remote activation in freely moving, nontethered animals. The MIP is examined as a tool for brain mapping in rats during a locomotor task. Cerebral blood flow-related tissue radioactivity (CBF-TR) was measured using [14C]-iodoantipyrine with an indicator-fractionation method, followed by autoradiography. Rats exposed to walking on a treadmill, compared to quiescent controls, showed increases in CBF-TR in motor circuits (primary motor cortex, dorsolateral striatum, ventrolateral thalamus, midline cerebellum, copula pyramis, paramedian lobule), in primary somatosensory cortex mapping the forelimbs, hindlimbs and trunk, as well as in secondary visual cortex. These results support the use of implantable pumps as adjunct tools for functional neuroimaging of behaviors that cannot be elicited in restrained or tethered animals.},

This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

abstract = {Several studies in cognitive neuroscience have investigated the cognitive and affective modulation of pain. By contrast, fewer studies have focused on the social modulation of pain, despite a plethora of relevant clinical findings. Here we present the first review of experimental studies addressing how interpersonal factors, such as the presence, behavior, and spatial proximity of an observer, modulate pain. Based on a systematic literature search, we identified 26 studies on experimentally induced pain that manipulated different interpersonal variables and measured behavioral, physiological, and neural pain-related responses. We observed that the modulation of pain by interpersonal factors depended on (1) the degree to which the social partners were active or were perceived by the participants to possess possibility for action; (2) the degree to which participants could perceive the specific intentions of the social partners; (3) the type of pre-existing relationship between the social partner and the person in pain, and lastly, (4) individual differences in relating to others and coping styles. Based on these findings, we propose that the modulation of pain by social factors can be fruitfully understood in relation to a recent predictive coding model, the free energy framework, particularly as applied to interoception and social cognition. Specifically, we argue that interpersonal interactions during pain may function as social, predictive signals of contextual threat or safety and as such influence the salience of noxious stimuli. The perception of such interpersonal interactions may in turn depend on (a) prior beliefs about interpersonal relating and (b) the certainty or precision by which an interpersonal interaction may predict environmental threat or safety.},
annote = {Take aways:

Our key proposal is that the perception of salient interpersonal interactions may enhance the precision of predic- tive signals regarding the salience of a noxious stimulus in a given environment, thus ultimately affecting the perceptual and active inferential processes that lead to pain perception and related motivated actions.

Specifically, interpersonal exchanges affect precision or salience by socially signaling the safety or threat of the impending stimulus itself or the environment in which the stimulus occurs




Overall, we found that unambiguously positive verbal and non-verbal interactions or positive interpersonally relevant primed interactions reduced pain, while negative, mixed valence, or ambiguous interactions led to increases in pain-related mea- sures. These findings were moderated by individual differences of the person in pain and the social partner, such as adult attachment style

Individual differences:
- social presence differentially impacts pain according to individual differences of the person in pain or of the social partner. Participants reporting higher levels of everyday social support and higher attachment avoidance, as well as participants with a solicitous spouse, had worse pain outcomes when a social partner was present than when they were alone, while participants with low levels of everyday social support showed the opposite effects. Unfortunately, the direction of the moderating effect of pain cata- strophizing remains unclear,while environmental threat seems to exacerbate pain.

Possibility for action:
- verbal and non-verbal interpersonal interactions with perceived possibility for action were found to be pain-reducing only when specific verbal behaviors with positive intention, such as supportive comments, reinterpretation,and dis- traction, or non-verbal interactions with a clear positive social meaning (e.g., holding one's partner's hand) were manipulated and participants had lowlevels of self-reported social support and attachment avoidance.

- By contrast, more unstructured, emotion- ally negative, varied,or vague social manipulations led to increases in pain, either directly (e.g.,presence conditionswith unstructured verbal content) or in interaction with variables linked to the per- ception of threat and anxiety, such as catastrophizing and threat manipulations.


Neuro-cognitive mechanisms?
1. Safety signalling of attachment figures associated with VMPFC activiation (Eisenberger et al. 2011)
2. Reward-related neural activation 

Relationship between social partner and the person in pain:
When interactions with different types of social partners were compared within the same experiment, with social manip- ulations remaining constant, partners were found to reduce pain more than strangers or acquaintances (Master et al., 2009;Younger et al., 2010; Eisenberger et al., 2011) (but most of these studies did not control for familiarity effects)

the type of relationship between participant and social partner may moderate how interpersonal factors affect pain. In general, pain seems to be attenuated when the participant is receptive to support (e.g., anxiously attached) and knows the partner is positively oriented toward them (but not highly solicitous), either due to a pre-existing relationship (e.g., between romantic partners), or experimental manipulation (e.g., empathy levels of previously unknown confederates are commu- nicated to the participant)




Pain is a subjective psychological state which acts as an indicator of threat to the organism in association with actual or potential tissue damage

Pain is multidimensional, including unpleasant feelings (interoception; Craig, 2002) and sensations (nociception) about the state of the organism, as well as moti- vated behaviors, such as withdrawing from a noxious stimulus

Pain can therefore constitute a process of perceptual inference about nociceptive signals on the basis of predictive, top-down signals about the homeostatic significance of such signals in the context of other synchronous biological, cognitive, and social conditions

the motivational aspects of pain can be conceptualized as a process of active inference, where actions are performed to change nociceptive input and update predictions. In a social context, suchactionsmay elicithelp fromothersandchange sensations via this social channel

review on experimental studies examining interpersonal influences rather than the larger social context of pain to advance our understanding of the causal inter- personal mechanisms that may shape an individual's pain experience




Social Dimensions of Pain

nociception (“the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli”; IASP, 1994) is not sufficient to explain the con- scious experience of pain (e.g.,Hofbauer et al., 2004;Baumg{\"{a}}rtner et al., 2006; Nikolajsen and Jensen, 2006; Lee et al., 2009), and it has been repeatedly demonstrated that psychosocial factors can have important top-down effects on pain (e.g.,

support from others is linked to beneficial effects on physiological and psychologicalwell-being (Uchino et al.,1996; Blasi et al., 2001; Kikusui et al., 2006) while social isolation and poor quality relationships are detrimental to health

support from others is not a panacea; rather, the effects of social support on health, such as stress and pain, depend on the facet of social support studied (e.g., Schaefer et al., 1981; Barrera, 1986) and on factors such as gender or relationship characteristics (Kirschbaum et al., 1995;Hennessy et al., 2009)

experimental manipulations reveal thatmultidimensional concepts such as social support may not be sufficient to characterize the socialmodulation of pain

Several perspectives exist which view pain (Sullivan et al., 2001;Craig, 2009a) and emotion more generally (Griffiths and Scarantino, 2009; Van Kleef, 2009; Coan, 2011) as embedded within a social context and posit mechanisms by which social partners affect an individual's experience (e.g., by providing support or contextual information)

provides a unifying, neurobiologically plausible account of the integration of different hierarchical levels of processing, fromnociception to social cognition

pre-existing mental models shape current perception and action at different time scales. This focus is consistent with the pain literature under consideration, which has long stressed the pivotal role influence of anticipatory cogni- tions and emotions on pain (e.g.,Wiech et al., 2010)

The essence of these models is that neurobiological message-passing in the brain is achieved by coding potentially ambiguous (noisy) incoming information in light of prior expectations about the likely sensory causes of such information.

prediction errors are assumed to be conveyed by feed-forward connections from lower to higher neural levels to improve representations in the latter, and higher-order predic- tions are transferred via feedback connections that can suppress prediction errors in lower levels

subjective feeling states as arising from predictive inferences on the causes of interoceptive signals (Seth et al., 2012)

Interoception in this renewed sense does not refer only to visceral sensation but to the central processing of all homeostatic afferent activity that can reflect the various components of the physiological condition of the body

Interoception and the brain:
pain and all feelings from the body are processed peripherally and centrally by a recently discovered lam- ina I spinothalamocortical pathway that projects to the posterior granular and mid-dysgranular regions of the insular cortex (serv- ing asprimary interoceptive cortex) via thebrainstemparabrachial nucleus and posterior part of the ventromedial thalamic nuclei (Craig, 2003, 2009b).

Primary interoceptive signals are thought to be represented in the mid/posterior insula, where they are also integrated with exteroceptive information coming from different brain areas. Further re-mappings within the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the orbitofrontal cortex are thought toconsolidatebody-state signalswith social,motivational, and contextual information to ultimately give rise to the conscious experience of emotions, as well as to prepare the organism for the necessary action in the environment (Damasio et al., 2000; Craig, 2002, 2009b; Critchley, 2005)

predictive signals from such a “salience net- work” process and integrate information about the significance of an impending noxious stimulus and determine whether or not such a stimulus will be consciously perceived as painful (Wiech et al.,2010),and indeed the insula cortex responds to interoceptive stimuli on the basis of expectations (Seth et al., 2012)

Pain can therefore constitute a process of perceptual inference about nociceptive signals on the basis of predictive, top-down signals about the homeostatic significance of such signals in the context of other synchronous biological, cognitive, and social conditions

pain engenders action, e.g., it motivates behaviors designed to ensure the organism is no longer under threat

the motivational aspects of pain can be conceptualized as a process of active inference, where actions are performed to change nociceptive input and update predictions. In a social context, suchactionsmay elicithelp fromothersandchange sensations via this social channel

Social Support and Clinical Pain:
some studies report correlations between perceived social sup- port and lower pain intensity (L{\'{o}}pez-Mart{\'{i}}nez et al., 2008), others have found a positive association between social support and pain behaviors (e.g.,Gil et al.,1987), levelof pain (Flor et al.,1987;Kerns et al., 1990), and disability (Romano et al., 1995)

Operant conditioning perspective: repeated instances of social support serve to reward or punish pain behaviors, leading to positive or negative reinforcement of such behaviors. While this model has been broadly supported, also in an experimental study (Jolliffe andNicholas, 2004), it does not include cognitive and affective factors and thus may not offer a complete picture of the complexity of social interactions (Newton- John, 2002)

Cognitive-behavioral models focusing more on pain appraisals have emerged. One prominent example is the communal coping model of pain catastrophizing (e.g., Sullivan et al., 2001), which claims that individuals who tend to catastrophize – that is, exaggerate the threat value of pain and see themselves as unable to cope with pain themselves (Keefe et al., 2000) – might engage in more pain behaviors to attract support from others

pain appraisals play a key role in the social context of pain

within a relationship context is the intimacy model (see Cano andWilliams, 2010), in which communicating pain to a partner is viewed as an attempt to create and maintain an emotionally intimate relationship environment

Insights from Animal Studies: 
Animals and particularly mammals are highly sociable, and many animals – including humans – rely on parental care for survival in early life
attachment system which manifests itself in the formation of close social bonds (Panksepp, 1998) (To regulate proximity to these critical caregivers, animals and humans possess an)

- Several studies have investigated whether such social bonds influence pain in ani- mals, typically by studying the behavior of mouse dyads while pain is induced in one dyad member

Langford et al (2010): female mice approaching a dyad member in pain led to less writhing from the mouse in pain. Crucially, these benefi- cial effects of social contact were seen only when the approaching mouse was a cagemate of the mouse in pain rather than a stranger 

D'Amato and Pavone (1993): discovered that interacting with siblings reduced pain sensitivity in mice whilst interacting with stranger mice did not
- shed light on possible underlying neurobiologicalmechanisms. Specifically, endogenous opioids and oxytocin have been implicated, the former relating to rein- forcement of social emotions (D'Amato andPavone,1993) and the latter playing an important role in social bonding (for a review, see Campbell, 2010)

Regarding endogenous opioids, D'Amato and Pavone found that their socially induced analgesic effectswere blockedwhenmice receivednaloxone,anopioid antagonist,point- ing to a mediating role of endogenous opioids

Oxytocin has been linked to pain reduction per se (Yu et al., 2003) and interacts with opioid and also dopaminergic systems,with dopamine driving the motivation to affiliate and formsocial bonds (McCall and Singer, 2012). F

Furthermore, oxytocin exerts positive effects such as preventing the development of depressive-like behavior in socially isolated mice with nerve damage (Norman et al., 2010). There- fore, these proposed neurobiological mechanisms seem to relate both to social bonding and pain.

similarities between pain and social loss have been
observed in animals (Panksepp et al., 1997): both pain and social experiences include threat,unpleasantness,and loss (e.g.,of a func- tion or fellow animal) in phenomenological terms, in phenomenological terms, opioid administration seems to alleviate both bodily pain and the pain of social isolation/absence of a caregiver 

Humans:

In humans, higher baseline pain sensitivity has been linked to greater distress following social rejection, 
heightened levels of social distress have been associated with more pain unpleasantness on thermal pain induction following social rejection (Eisenberger et al., 2006)

Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that similar neural regions to those implicated in bodily pain are activated during social pain (e.g., the dorsal ACC; Eisenberger et al., 2003; Eisenberger, 2012) though whether these regions are pain- specific is debated (e.g., Legrain et al., 2011;Mouraux et al., 2011) studies were included if they reported behavioral pain outcomes (e.g., pain intensity ratings, facial expressions) or pain-related physiological outcomes.

Measures:
1) “Pain ratings” refers to participant-generated ratings, e.g., of pain intensity, unpleas- antness, or pain threshold; 
(2) “pain behaviors” denotes pain- related behaviors such as pain tolerance or facial expressions; 
(3) “pain words” refers to pain-related verbalizations to the social partner; 
(4) “physiological measures” pertains to mea- sures of heart rate, skin conductance levels, blood pressure, etc.; and 
(5) “neural activity” signifies magnetoencephalogra- phy (MEG), and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) mea- sures obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).


studies manipulated a variety of interpersonal
factors including 
verbal interactions (e.g., Chambers et al., 2002; Jackson et al., 2005), 
non-verbal interactions (e.g., hand-holding; Master et al., 2009), 
mere physical presence of the social partner (Brown et al., 2003;Vervoort et al., 2008),
priming by photographs of partners (e.g., Eisenberger et al., 2011) and 
manipulations of participants' perception of the social partner (e.g., Sambo et al., 2010; Peeters and Vlaeyen, 2011)

studies differed in terms of the characteristics of their sample, for instance 
participant and partner gender, and 
personality traits (e.g., pain catastro- phizing; Sullivan et al., 2004; 
or attachment style; Sambo et al., 2010; Wilson and Ruben, 2011).


1. The Social Partner's Possibility for Action/No Perceived Possibility for Action

2. Relationship Between the Social Partner and the Person in Pain
different types of relationships, according to whether the social partner was 
a stranger (e.g., Jack- son et al., 2005), 
a parent (e.g., Vervoort et al., 2011), a friend (e.g.,McClelland and McCubbin, 2008), or 
the romantic partner (e.g.,Master et al., 2009) of the person in pain

interaction history: contrasting rich interaction histories (parent, partner, and friend) with one-off interactions with strangers. Previous experiences with the social partner were considered to be important not only froman attachment perspective (see below) but also in terms of predictability of the other's mental state, which we address in the discussion.


THE SOCIAL PARTNER'S POSSIBILITY FOR ACTION:
22 studies manipulated aspects of interpersonal inter- actions in which the social partner was physically present and was perceived to have the possibility to act toward the person in pain
In 9 of these studies, the social manipulation involved the opportunity of engaging in verbal communication
the social partner was generally designed to act in a socially supportive role toward the personin pain

Six studies (Chambers et al., 2002; Brown et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2005, studies 1 and 2; Jack- son et al., 2009;Wilson and Ruben, 2011) included conditions in which the content of the interaction was unstructured (i.e., not pre-determined by the experimenters).

In Brown et al.'s (2003): Regardless of whether the social partner was a friend or a stranger, participants reportedmore pain in the unstructured interaction condition and when experiencing pain alone than they did in the active and pas sive support conditions (Brown et al., 2003).

Jackson and colleagues found in a first study that participants who spoke to an empathic exper- imenter (“transaction opportunity” condition) showed reduced pain tolerance and increased pain intensity compared to partici- pants who did not speak to the experimenter (Jackson et al., 2005, study 1).

This was mirrored in their second study (Jackson et al., 2005, study 2), in which female participants displayed the lowest pain tolerance in the transactionopportunity condition,compared to structured conditions, such as distraction and encouragement conditions.

Chambers and colleagues trained mothers to respond to their children's pain in either 
pain-promoting ways (which included reassurance, empathy, mild criticism, and giving control to the child) or 
pain-reducing ways (which included dis- traction with an alternative task, humor, and “encouragement to use coping strategies”)

or mother and child interacted as normal in an unstructured way.

Girls reported highest pain intensity in the pain-promoting group, followed by the unstructured interaction, and then the pain-reducing condition (Chambers et al., 2002

These effects were not present in boys, in accordance with other findings (Jackson et al., 2005, study 2; Jackson, 2007).

As the pain-promoting condition included different social attitudes (e.g., empathy and mild criticism were included in the same interaction condition), it may have been more mixed than other structured conditions, in accordance with Brown et al.'s explanation regard- ing their unstructured condition. It thus seems that unstructured or mixed valence verbal interactions with an observer can worsen the experience of pain

adult attachment style moderated the relationship between unstructured verbal interactions and pain (Wilson and Ruben 2011) 

[Attachment styles derive from attachment theory (Bowlby, 1977) and are individual differences in interpersonal relating formed in infancy over repeated interac- tions with a primary caregiver]

In adulthood, attachment styles are generally classified as secure or insecure; the latter commonly being subdivided into anxious and avoidant styles (though attachment styles are also viewed dimen- sionally, e.g., Fraley et al., 2000)

In brief, securely attached adults are typically comfortable with closeness and depending on others, while anxious adults are preoccupied with the relationship and fear abandonment, and avoidant individuals are uncomfortable with closeness and lack trust in relationship partners (Hazan and Shaver, 1987).

Wilson and Ruben found that in couples in which the woman received noxious stimuli, highest pain was reported when both members of the couple had higher levels of attachment anxiety

In a within-subject design, Sambo et al. (2010) informed participants prior to the administration of noxious stimuli that each of the experimenters present during each of two identical blocks of noxious stimulation had either expressed high or low empathy for them during initial thresholding (determining a participant's pain threshold). In a third condition, participants experienced pain alone. 

The perceived empathy manipulation interacted with the participants' adult attachment style to affect pain, in that higher attachment anxiety predicted less pain in the high empathy compared to the low empathy condition

avoidant attachment was the only factor that moderated the relationship between social presence and pain report, such that higher attachment avoidance predicted more pain in the presence vs. alone condition, possibly because avoidant individuals prefer to cope on their own

This article surveys several contemporary theories of these traumatic ordeals, and argues that these theories establish generalities only at the cost of adequate engagement with the cognitive and affective processes entailed in ritual performance. I propose a new approach, based on theories of `flashbulb memory', which penetrates more deeply the religious experiences engendered in traumatic ritual, and also accounts for certain recurrent patterns of political association in initiation systems. `Rites of terror' are here envisaged as art of a nexus of psychological and sociological processes, dubbed the `imagistimode of religiosity'.},

abstract = {Background Alterations in central neurotransmission and immune function have been documented in major depression (MDD). Central and peripheral endogenous opioids are linked to immune functioning in animal models, stress-activated, and dysregulated in MDD. We examined the relationship between $\mu$-opioid receptor (OR)-mediated neurotransmission and a proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-18). Methods We studied 28 female subjects (14 MDDs, 14 control subjects) with positron emission tomography and [11C] carfentanil ($\mu$-OR selective) during neutral and sadness states. With a simple regression model in SPM2 (Wellcome Trust, London, England) we identified brain regions where baseline $\mu$-OR availability (nondisplaceable binding potential [BPND]) and sadness-induced changes in $\mu$-OR BPND were associated with baseline IL-18. Results Baseline IL-18 was greater in MDDs than control subjects [t(25) = 2.13, p = .04]. In control subjects IL-18 was correlated with negative emotional ratings at baseline and during sadness induction. In MDDs, IL-18 was positively correlated with baseline regional $\mu$-OR BPND and with sadness-induced $\mu$-opioid system activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate, ventral basal ganglia, and amygdala. Conclusions This study links plasma IL-18 with sadness-induced emotional responses in healthy subjects, the diagnosis of MDD, and $\mu$-opioid functioning, itself involved in stress adaptation, emotion regulation, and reward. This suggests that IL-18 represents a marker associated with emotion regulation/dysregulation at least in part through central opioid mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {The effects of regular exercise versus a single bout of exercise on cognition, anxiety, and mood were systematically examined in healthy, sedentary young adults who were genotyped to determine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) allelic status (i.e., Val-Val or Val66Met polymorphism). Participants were evaluated on novel object recognition (NOR) memory and a battery of mental health surveys before and after engaging in either (a) a 4-week exercise program, with exercise on the final test day, (b) a 4-week exercise program, without exercise on the final test day, (c) a single bout of exercise on the final test day, or (d) remaining sedentary between test days. Exercise enhanced object recognition memory and produced a beneficial decrease in perceived stress, but only in participants who exercised for 4 weeks including the final day of testing. In contrast, a single bout of exercise did not affect recognition memory and resulted in increased perceived stress levels. An additional novel finding was that the improvements on the NOR task were observed exclusively in participants who were homozygous for the BDNF Val allele, indicating that altered activity-dependent release of BDNF in Met allele carriers may attenuate the cognitive benefits of exercise. Importantly, exercise-induced changes in cognition were not correlated with changes in mood/anxiety, suggesting that separate neural systems mediate these effects. These data in humans mirror recent data from our group in rodents. Taken together, these current findings provide new insights into the behavioral and neural mechanisms that mediate the effects of physical exercise on memory and mental health in humans. ?? 2012 IBRO.},

abstract = {Compared to the study of negative emotions such as fear, the neurobiology of positive emotional processes and the associated positive affect (PA) states has only recently received scientific attention. Biological theories conceptualize PA as being related to (i) signals indicating that bodies are returning to equilibrium among those studying homeostasis, (ii) utility estimation among those favoring neuroeconomic views, and (iii) approach and other instinctual behaviors among those cultivating neuroethological perspectives. Indeed, there are probably several distinct forms of positive affect, but all are closely related to ancient sub-neocortical limbic brain regions we share with other mammals. There is now a convergence of evidence to suggest that various regions of the limbic system, including especially ventral striatal dopamine systems are implemented in an anticipatory (appetitive) positive affective state. Dopamine independent mechanisms utilizing opiate and GABA receptors in the ventral striatum, amygdala and orbital frontal cortex are important in elaborating consummatory PA (i.e. sensory pleasure) states, and various neuropeptides mediate homeostatic satisfactions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The issue of whether other animals have internally felt experiences has vexed animal behavioral science since its inception. Although most investigators remain agnostic on such contentious issues, there is now abundant experimental evidence indicating that all mammals have negatively and positively-valenced emotional networks concentrated in homologous brain regions that mediate affective experiences when animals are emotionally aroused. That is what the neuroscientific evidence indicates. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: THE RELEVANT LINES OF EVIDENCE ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) It is easy to elicit powerful unconditioned emotional responses using localized electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB); these effects are concentrated in ancient subcortical brain regions. Seven types of emotional arousals have been described; using a special capitalized nomenclature for such primary process emotional systems, they are SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, PANIC/GRIEF and PLAY. 2) These brain circuits are situated in homologous subcortical brain regions in all vertebrates tested. Thus, if one activates FEAR arousal circuits in rats, cats or primates, all exhibit similar fear responses. 3) All primary-process emotional-instinctual urges, even ones as complex as social PLAY, remain intact after radical neo-decortication early in life; thus, the neocortex is not essential for the generation of primary-process emotionality. 4) Using diverse measures, one can demonstrate that animals like and dislike ESB of brain regions that evoke unconditioned instinctual emotional behaviors: Such ESBs can serve as 'rewards' and 'punishments' in diverse approach and escape/avoidance learning tasks. 5) Comparable ESB of human brains yield comparable affective experiences. Thus, robust evidence indicates that raw primary-process (i.e., instinctual, unconditioned) emotional behaviors and feelings emanate from homologous brain functions in all mammals (see Appendix S1), which are regulated by higher brain regions. Such findings suggest nested-hierarchies of BrainMind affective processing, with primal emotional functions being foundational for secondary-process learning and memory mechanisms, which interface with tertiary-process cognitive-thoughtful functions of the BrainMind.},

abstract = {It is the central hypothesis of this paper that the mental states commonly referred to as altered states of consciousness are principally due to transient prefrontal cortex deregulation. Supportive evidence from psychological and neuroscientific studies of dreaming, endurance running, meditation, daydreaming, hypnosis, and various drug-induced states is presented and integrated. It is proposed that transient hypofrontality is the unifying feature of all altered states and that the phenomenological uniqueness of each state is the result of the differential viability of various frontal circuits. Using an evolutionary approach, consciousness is conceptualized as hierarchically ordered cognitive function. Higher-order structures perform increasingly integrative functions and thus contribute more sophisticated content. Although this implies a holistic approach to consciousness, such a functional hierarchy localizes the most sophisticated layers of consciousness in the zenithal higher-order structure: the prefrontal cortex. The hallmark of altered states of consciousness is the subtle modification of behavioral and cognitive functions that are typically ascribed to the prefrontal cortex. The theoretical framework presented yields a number of testable hypotheses. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

Likewise, the general failure of neuroscientists to postulate how basic brain circuits might mediate emotional urges has retarded the development of scientific perspectives that could inform new inquiries into the underlying dynamics and treatment of addictions. In this paper, we revisit the argument that prototypically abused substances activate or alter specific emotional brain systems that were evolutionarily designed to signal potential increments or decrements in fitness. We then discuss two distinct emotional systems (reward seeking and separation distress) which may track different types of potential changes in fitness. Based on this evolutionarily inspired approach, we illustrate how a mammalian model of emotion (i.e. rodent ultrasonic vocalizations) may enable scientists to predict drug-related phenomena such as abuse potential, anatomical location of mediating neural substrates, and the psychological impact of withdrawal. We conclude by discussing some therapeutic and social implications of examining drug addiction processes with multiple emotional brain systems in mind.},

abstract = {The position advanced in this paper is that the bedrock of emotional feelings is contained within the evolved emotional action apparatus of mammalian brains. This dual-aspect monism approach to brain-mind functions, which asserts that emotional feelings may reflect the neurodynamics of brain systems that generate instinctual emotional behaviors, saves us from various conceptual conundrums. In coarse form, primary process affective consciousness seems to be fundamentally an unconditional "gift of nature" rather than an acquired skill, even though those systems facilitate skill acquisition via various felt reinforcements. Affective consciousness, being a comparatively intrinsic function of the brain, shared homologously by all mammalian species, should be the easiest variant of consciousness to study in animals. This is not to deny that some secondary processes (e.g., awareness of feelings in the generation of behavioral choices) cannot be evaluated in animals with sufficiently clever behavioral learning procedures, as with place-preference procedures and the analysis of changes in learned behaviors after one has induced re-valuation of incentives. Rather, the claim is that a direct neuroscientific study of primary process emotional/affective states is best achieved through the study of the intrinsic ("instinctual"), albeit experientially refined, emotional action tendencies of other animals. In this view, core emotional feelings may reflect the neurodynamic attractor landscapes of a variety of extended trans-diencephalic, limbic emotional action systems-including SEEKING, FEAR, RAGE, LUST, CARE, PANIC, and PLAY. Through a study of these brain systems, the neural infrastructure of human and animal affective consciousness may be revealed. Emotional feelings are instantiated in large-scale neurodynamics that can be most effectively monitored via the ethological analysis of emotional action tendencies and the accompanying brain neurochemical/electrical changes. The intrinsic coherence of such emotional responses is demonstrated by the fact that they can be provoked by electrical and chemical stimulation of specific brain zones-effects that are affectively laden. For substantive progress in this emerging research arena, animal brain researchers need to discuss affective brain functions more openly. Secondary awareness processes, because of their more conditional, contextually situated nature, are more difficult to understand in any neuroscientific detail. In other words, the information-processing brain functions, critical for cognitive consciousness, are harder to study in other animals than the more homologous emotional/motivational affective state functions of the brain. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test whether affective response to an acute bout of exercise can predict regular voluntary exercise, and specifically whether a positive affective response helps translate intentions into behaviour. DESIGN: A prospective correlational design. METHODS: Participants (N=127) recruited from the community reported intentions to engage in voluntary exercise and frequency of participation in voluntary exercise both at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up. Self-reported positive affect, negative affect, tranquillity, and fatigue were assessed during a bout of moderate intensity exercise. RESULTS: Within subject slopes for increases in positive affect and decreases in fatigue during exercise, and increased tranquillity and decreased fatigue post-exercise were associated with more frequent participation in exercise at follow-up. Changes in negative affect did not predict exercise at follow-up; however, this was likely due to floor effects leading to lack of baseline variability in negative affect. Importantly, a positive affective response to exercise moderated the intention-behaviour relationship, such that those who responded to exercise more favourably exhibited stronger relationships between intentions and future exercise behaviour Conclusions: We conclude that exercise-related increases in positive affect and tranquillity and decreases in feelings of fatigue can aid in the successful translation of exercise intentions into behaviour.},

abstract = {Objectives: Kimiecik and Stein's (1992) flow model proposed that personal and situational factors affect the experience of flow. Singer (1988, 2000) argued that different mental processes underlie self-initiated and reactive performances. The first purpose of this study was to examine main and interaction effects between imagery use and confidence on flow state in different performance contexts. The second purpose was to assess main and interaction effects between flow state, imagery, and confidence on self-paced service and externally-paced groundstroke performance in tennis. Design: This field study used a repeated-measures design. Method: A pilot study was conducted to inform the set up of the two performance contexts. Flow states were assessed on two separate occasions, (a) for the service performance, and (b) for the groundstroke performance. A total of 60 junior tennis athletes completed imagery and confidence measures before the field test. Results: A significant interaction between imagery and confidence was found for flow state in the groundstroke but not in the service task. No significant interaction effects were found for performance outcome. Flow state significantly predicted groundstroke performance, and imagery and confidence predicted service performance. Conclusions: The examination of flow in different performance contexts is challenging. Imagery and confidence are central to the experience of flow. Flow state appeared to be more important for the externally-paced than self-paced task.

abstract = {Substantial evidence suggests that all commonly abused drugs act upon the brain reward circuitry to ultimately increase extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and other forebrain areas. Many drugs of abuse appear to increase dopamine levels by dramatically increase the firing and bursting rates of dopamine neurons located in the ventral mesencephalon. Recent clinical evidence in humans and behavioral evidence in animals indicate that cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716A (Rimonabant) can reduce the self-administration of, and craving for, several commonly addictive drugs. However, the mechanism of this potentially beneficial effect has not yet been identified. We propose, on the basis of recent studies in our laboratory and others, that these antagonists may act by blocking the effects of endogenously released cannabinoid molecules (endocannabinoids) that are released in an activity- and calcium-dependent manner from mesencephalic dopamine neurons. It is hypothesized that, through the antagonism of cannabinoid CB1 receptors located on inhibitory and excitatory axon terminals targeting the midbrain dopamine neurons, the effects of the endocannabinoids are occluded. The data from these studies therefore suggest that the endocannabinoid system and the CB1 receptors located in the ventral mesencephalon may play an important role in regulating drug reward processes, and that this substrate is recruited whenever dopamine neuron activity is increased.},

abstract = {Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent but perplexing behavior problem in which people deliberately harm themselves without lethal intent. Research reveals that NSSI typically has its onset during early adolescence; most often involves cutting or carving the skin; and appears equally prevalent across sexes, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. Less is known about why people engage in NSSI. This article presents a theoretical model of the development and maintenance of NSSI. Rather than a symptom of mental disorder, NSSI is conceptualized as a harmful behavior that can serve several intrapersonal (e.g., affect regulation) and interpersonal (e.g., help-seeking) functions. Risk of NSSI is increased by general factors that contribute to problems with affect regulation or interpersonal communication (e.g., childhood abuse) and by specific factors that influence the decision to use NSSI rather than some other behavior to serve these functions (e.g., social modeling). This model synthesizes research from several different areas of the literature and points toward several lines of research needed to further advance the understanding of why people hurt themselves.},

annote = {Scarry (1985) wrote, ‘‘for the person in pain, so incontestably and unnegotiably present is it that ‘having pain' may come to be thought of as the most vibrant example of what it is to ‘have certainty''' (p. 4).

This sense of certainty and existence was echoed in a study of pain by the medical anthropologist Kleinman (1988), who asserted that pain can transform one's personality and make people feel so vulnerable that it ‘‘leads to withdrawal, to isolation'' (p. 64), yet that to confront pain ‘‘is a struggle to be inde- pendent, tough, in charge of one's own life'' (p. 91).

In conquering this pain, a person may achieve the flow experience described by Csikszentmihalyi (1990), which is an auto- telic experience that makes life more ‘‘rich, intense, meaningful'' (p. 70)

If marketing today is about the symbolic consumption of meaning (Brown, 1993; Elliott, 1999), then by exten- sion pain, discomfort, or even unhappiness mayalsobecommodified, either as signified or signifier (Baudrillard, 1981).
--- Cross Fit: the commoditisation of pain!!!

Conclusion:
In 2004, informed by Faith Popcorn, an expert of future trends, Macneil's Tylenol brand formed pain partner relationships by funding subcultural events such as skateboarding and break dancing to attract the 18–34 year old market. The company launched the Ouch! cultural relevance campaign, in which end- uring pain was presented as being ‘‘cool'' (Grapentine, 2004). The Ouch! project man- ager at Tylenol stated that ‘‘For this new generation pain is a badge. Pain is a rite of passage; it means you are living life to the fullest'' (Mehr, 2005). 

Individuals are enc- ouragedtofind theirown way todiscover their own sources of fulfillment, but this has some important consequences. When it comes to answering the big ‘meaning of life'- type questions, this system of individual liberty generates more, not less, disagree- ment'' (p. 331).

In logotherapy, the trans- cendental self is analogous with the idea of reflective individualism as posited by Csikzent- mihalyi (1990), and is a state of happiness that not many people are able to achieve. It is a sense of ‘‘real'' happiness in hyperrealism. Ouch.. .},

abstract = {THIS STUDY HAD THE FOLLOWING TWO AIMS: First, to explore the effects of acute resistance exercise (RE, i.e., using exercise machines to contract and stretch muscles) on behavioral and electrophysiological performance when performing a cognitive task involving executive functioning in young male adults; Second, to investigate the potential biochemical mechanisms of such facilitative effects using two neurotrophic factors [i.e., growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)] and the cortisol levels elicited by such an exercise intervention mode with two different exercise intensities. Sixty young male adults were recruited and randomly assigned to a high-intensity (HI) exercise group, moderate-intensity (MI) exercise group, and non-exercise-intervention (NEI) group. Blood samples were taken, and the behavioral and electrophysiological indices were simultaneously measured when individuals performed a Go/No-Go task combined with the Erikson Flanker paradigm at baseline and after either an acute bout of 30 min of moderate- or high-intensity RE or a control period. The results showed that the acute RE could not only benefit the subjects' behavioral (i.e., RTs and accuracy) performance, as found in previous studies, but also increase the P3 amplitude. Although the serum GH and IGF-1 levels were significantly increased via moderate or high intensity RE in both the MI and HI groups, the increased serum levels of neurotrophic factors were significantly decreased about 20 min after exercise. In addition, such changes were not correlated with the changes in cognitive (i.e., behavioral and electrophysiological) performance. In contrast, the serum levels of cortisol in the HI and MI groups were significantly lower after acute RE, and the changes in cortisol levels were significantly associated with the changes in electrophysiological (i.e., P3 amplitude) performance. The findings suggest the beneficial effects of acute RE on executive functioning could be due to changes in arousal, possibly modulated by the serum cortisol levels.},

The results indicate that all six randomized exercise intervention groups experience rather high levels of flow regardless of whether the intervention is a team or individual sport. Differences in experiencing flow, worry and exertion as well as physiological improvements could be found for the different types of sports and the two genders, with the male football group having the highest score for physiological improvement and the lowest score for worry. A connection between experiencing flow and physiological improvement could not be found. Future research should investigate the influence that the participant's gender and also the type of sport have on experiencing flow, worry and perceived exertion.

abstract = {Drug addiction can take control of the brain and behavior, activating behavioral patterns that are directed excessively and compulsively toward drug usage. Such patterns often involve the development of repetitive and nearly automatic behaviors that we call habits. The striatum, a subcortical brain region important for proper motor function as well as for the formation of behavioral habits, is a major target for drugs of abuse. Here, we review recent studies of long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum, emphasizing that drugs of abuse can exert pronounced influences on these processes, both in the striatum and in the dopaminergic midbrain. Synaptic plasticity in the ventral striatum appears to play a prominent role in early stages of drug use, whereas dopamine- and endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum could contribute to the formation of persistent drug-related habits when casual drug use progresses towards compulsive drug use and addiction.},

annote = {Participation in collective emotional gatherings:

(a) enhances social identity (i.e., social identity, Neville{\&}Reicher, 2011; ethnic identification, Gasparre, Bosco, {\&} Bellelli, 2010; identity fusion with others, Swann, Jetten, G{\'{o}}mez, Whitehouse, {\&} Bastian, 2012), which implies a qualitative change in self-concept from personal to social, switching the self to a collective level, as posited by the self-categorization perspective;

(b) increases social cohesion and social integration (Weiss {\&} Richards, 1997; perceived social sup- port, P{\'{a}}ez, Basabe, Ubillos, {\&} Gonzalez, 2007; positive intergroup stereotypes and positive emotional climate, Kanyangara, Rim{\'{e}}, Philippot, {\&} Yzerbyt, 2007; solidarity, Hawdon {\&} Ryan, 2011); 

(c) reinforces positive emotions and affect (Fischer et al., 2014; Neville {\&} Reicher, 2011; P{\'{a}}ez et al., 2007); 



(d) enhances empowerment or reinforces self-concept, including both self-esteem and self-efficacy (Drury {\&} Reicher, 2005; personal self-esteem, P{\'{a}}ez et al., 2007; collective self-esteem, Rim{\'{e}}, Kanyangara, Yzerbyt, {\&} P{\'{a}}ez, 2011); and 

(e) aids endorsement of the group's beliefs and values (Collins, 2004; Fischer et al., 2014; P{\'{a}}ez et al., 2007)

Thus, even if collective events can entail negative effects and costs (e.g., enhancing negative emotions, hatred, and negative stereotypes of out-group members), successful collective emotional gatherings can simultaneously reinforce positive affect, self-esteem, and well-being (Tewari, Khan, Hopkins, Srini- vasan, {\&} Reicher, 2012).


Movement Synchronization

McNeill (1995) identified effects that can be grouped into four classes:

(a) openness to the world (altered consciousness, inflation of the self, blurring of self-awareness, or loss of self-boundaries); 

(b) openness to others (feelings of being together, of being one with others, or “esprit de corps”); 

(c) positive affect (relaxation, calming, or well-being); and 

(d) empowerment (confidence, en- ergy, strength, or satisfaction with the world in general).

(e.g., Kirschner {\&} Tomasello, 2009; Miles, Nind, Henderson, {\&} Macrae, 2010; Paladino, Mazzurega, Pavani, {\&} Schubert, 2010; Vacharkulksemsuk {\&} Fredrickson, 2012; Valdesolo, Ouyang, {\&} DeSteno, 2010; Wiltermuth {\&} Heath, 2009).

Mimicry
Chartrand and Lakin (2013) found being mimicked to entail: 
(a) positive affect, and
(b) openness to others (as indexed through attraction, empathy, helping behavior, perception of interdepen- dence, choice of physical closeness, confidence in each other, progress of negotiations, or ability to decode emotions). Imitation was also found to increase prosocial behavior (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, {\&} van Knippenberg, 2004)

In Durkheim's view, the specific nature of the pooled feelings does not matter. They can range from extreme depression to extreme elation, painful irritation, or ecstatic enthusiasm. What is essential is that individuals are gathered together, that common feelings are felt and that these feelings are expressed in common acts

We view the emotional effervescence that develops in a collective gathering as a multifaceted process of social synchronization.

(a) participants converge together in special spaces and at particular times; 
(b) they share concerns, intentions, and goals and they mutually reinforce them as the event develops; 
(c) they share cognitive and emotional responses to the displayed group symbols (e.g., flags, emblems, leaders, or icons); 
(d) they focus their attention on a single target— podium, stage, altar, speaker, leader, priest, and so forth; 
(e) they display group mimesis or coordinated collective behaviors (shared gestures, shared movements, moving, and marching together), thus enacting behavioral synchrony; and 
(f) their synchronized behaviors are accompanied by coordinated expressive manifestations (singing together, yelling, saying particular words or sentences, playing music, dancing, etc.)

every participant's mind, voice and body becomes attuned to the state shared in the group.

elements stimulate participants' emotional arousal in such a way that they will experience and enact similar emotional states; 

Because of the ease with which emotions are mirrored, shared, and spread among people who are copresent (Gallese, 2001; Hatfield, Cacioppo, {\&} Rapson, 1993; Iacoboni, 2009; Rim{\'{e}}, 2007), a situation of emotional synchrony develops; thus, entailing perceptions of similarity and unity: “we feel the same, we are the same, we are one,” by this token massively reinforcing group identification (Collins, 2004; Rossano, 2012; von Scheve {\&} Ismer, 2013).

Shared emotion was recently shown to act as an antecedent of collective identity. 

- Livingstone, Spears, Manstead, Bruder, and Shepherd (2011) showed that the fit between participants' own emotional reactions and the reactions of ingroup members influences self-categorization

Xygalatas, Konvalinka, Bulbulia, and Roepstorff (2011): found shared patterns in heart-rate dynamics between participants and spectators who had previously reported identifying with fire- walkers. This confirmed that in a ritual, identification between actors and spectators elicits shared emotional states.

Emotional convergence through implicit and explicit behaviour:
Perceiving someone's facial expression in a social interaction contributed to actually feeling the emotion asso- ciated with that expression (Stel {\&} Vonk, 2010). Hatfield and colleagues (1993) emphasized that in addition to facial expres- sions, haptic, vocal, and verbal information from others also evokes emotional contagion. Studies on the social sharing of emotion (e.g., Rim{\'{e}}, 2009) and on capitalization of positive emo- tion (e.g., Gable {\&} Reis, 2010) found that verbal interaction increases emotionality and induces emotional convergence among interaction partners, partly because it elicits a common appraisal of events (von Scheve {\&} Ismer, 2013). 

Finally, participation in collective gatherings stimulates social sharing of emotion, which in turn reinforces participants' personal and collective emotions (Rim{\'{e}}, 2007; Rim{\'{e}}, P{\'{a}}ez, Basabe, {\&} Mart{\'{i}}nez, 2010) 


Elaborated Social Identity Model of crowd behavior (ESIM; Drury {\&} Reicher, 2005, 2009)
the shift from “me” to “we” means a greater commitment and loyalty to the group, which is now seen more like “self” than as “other.”

According to the ESIM, the changes in self-categorization resulting from participation in a collective movement can account for the transformation of an aggregate of individuals into a psychologically unified crowd with social cohesion. 

shared emotions play a key role in collective gatherings. Social identification results from a “hot” emotional process that complements the cognitive self- categorization

Collective Gatherings and Shared Flow
gatherings or rituals as “affordances that a society offers to its members in order to allow them to meet optimal experiences under socially desirable forms” (Csikszentmih{\'{a}}lyi 1990, p. 432)

Interviews with athletes revealed that in team sports, unison movements, and shared focus of attention are critical to the experience of flow (Schiepe-Tiska {\&} Engerser, 2011)

Hypotheses

First, Research should examine whether the predicted effects happen together: i.e., enhancement of collective identity and social integration, positive affect, self-esteem, shared beliefs, and values. (empirical support exists for each of the various predicted effects , but the evidence is scattered across a multitude of studies)

Hypothesis 1: participation in a collective gathering would strengthen participants' collective identity—meaning social integration and identity fusion—positive affect, empowerment, or self-esteem, and endorsement of the group's values and beliefs.

Second, Durkheim was explicit that regardless of the positive or negative valence of the collective event, participants would manifest the predicted positive effects. Studies should thus assess the predicted effects in both positively and negatively valenced collective gatherings. 

Hypothesis 2: the various effects would be manifest in both positively and negatively valenced collective gatherings.

Third, Durkheim considered collective emotions to play a critical role. We showed that this view is now controversial. Up to now, this essential aspect of the model remained unassessed with regard to the various effects it predicts. 

Hypothesis 3: the more participants experienced emotional synchrony in the collective situation, the stronger the various predicted effects

Fourth, Durkheim's emotional effervescence and Cs{\'{i}}kszentmih{\'{a}}lyi's non-emotional flow should be disentangled as ways of accounting for the effects of participation in collective gatherings.



- Identity Fusion was evaluated in Studies 2 and 4 using a measure of fusion with the specific in-group;
• Social integration was addressed in Studies 1 and 2 with a scale assessing the feeling of belonging and in Study 3 with a scale assessing perceived social support;
• Positive affect was evaluated with items of positive and negative affect in Study 1, a positivity scale in Study 2, and items assessing hope and anger in Study 3;
• Empowerment was evaluated using a self-esteem scale in Study 1, a scale of collective efficacy in Study 2, and a collective self-esteem scale in Study 4; and
• Endorsement of social beliefs was measured in Studies 1 and 2 using a scale assessing basic beliefs about the world and society and a scale assessing beliefs in a just world, and in Study 3 using a scale assessing endorsement of the group's values.

Study 1: Pseudomilitary Folkloric Marches in Belgium

compared with control nonwalkers from the same region, we expected walkers to manifest higher levels of social integration, positive affect, and empowerment, as well as stronger social beliefs after their participation. Additionally, walk- ers who reported stronger feelings of emotional synchrony during the event were expected to display these effects to a higher degree

significant group effect (participants versus nonparticipants), Separate comparisons revealed markedly significant effects for five of the six variables (see Table 1); the two groups did not differ for negative affect.

Limitations:

1. the study design did not allow us to rule out a selection effect. It was possible that walkers already differed from control respondents before their participation

2. Another limitation we should mention concerns the fact that to compare walkers and nonwalkers, and to guarantee similar sample sizes, we finally included in the study ?30{\%} of the initial sample of nonwalkers paired for age and sex. However, an analysis comparing nonwalkers who were finally included in the study with those who were not did not yield significant differences in out- come variables

Study 2: Pseudomilitary Folkloric Marches in the Basque Country

2 days before and 2 days after the Tamborrada, participants completed questionnaires mea- suring the positive outcome expected from their participation, that is, their social integration, positive affect, empowerment, and social beliefs. 

In addition, on the afternoon following the Tamboall participants filled out the scale measuring their experi- ence of emotional synchrony in this folkloric event

In line with Durkheim's emotional effervescence concept, the hypothesis was that compared with their lower-emotional-synchrony counterparts, participants in the Tamborrada who experienced higher emotional synchrony during the celebration would report higher levels of social integration, of personal well-being and of social beliefs after their participation, controlling for baseline or pre-event measure- ments for these dependent measures.

contextual source of identity fusion was to be found in the sharing of bonding experiences with others and in participating in affec- tively loaded social rituals. Our participants thus responded three times—before, during, and after the Tamborrada—to the pictorial measure used by Swann, G{\'{o}}mez, Seyle, Morales, and Huici (2009) to assess the experience of identity fusion.

Additionally, the study included a measure of optimal experi-
ence or “flow” (Cs{\'{i}}kszentmih{\'{a}}lyi, 1990). As mentioned in our introduction, Schiepe-Tiska and Engerser (2011) showed evidence of overlap between shared optimal experience and perceived emotional synchrony in the context of collective synchronized performance.

Athletes reported flow in team sports as resulting from unison movements, shared focus of attention, positive team inter- action, and feeling part of the group. Furthermore, experiencing flow in a social context contributed to dissolving the psychological contours that usually separate individuals. They become “fused” with the group (G{\'{o}}mez et al., 2011)

Results:
Multiple regressions were calculated using pre-event or baseline measurements as predictors, perceived emotional synchrony and shared flow as mediating variables, and level of involvement as the independent variable

high perceived emotional synchrony walkers reported stronger feelings of fusion with the group, higher perceived social integration, higher happiness, higher collective efficacy, and a more positive or benevolent and just perception of the world

Shared flow showed a significant predictive coefficient only for collective efficacy,

Perceived emotional synchrony mediated the effect of level of involvement, reducing the coefficient of level on out- comes, as well as showing an indirect effect of level on outcomes through perceived emotional synchrony for feelings of fusion with the group, for perceived social integration , for well-being, for collective efficacy, and for positive or benevolent and just percep- tion of the world, although the indirect effect through flow was not significant, with the exception of collective efficacy.

Even though flow and perceived emotional synchrony correlated strongly and were both linked to identity fusion, the results of a mediational analysis supported the hypothesis of a greater importance of emotional synchrony compared with flow.

A repeated-measures ANOVA was also used to assess the hypothesis regarding identity fusion scores. The time effect was significant for these scores. Indeed, the quadratic component was significant, showing that the feeling of fusion with the group was climactically higher during the folkloric march

Furthermore, though the interaction of the quadratic time effect of high versus low emo- tional fusion was only marginally significant, Figure 2 shows that identity fusion scores
remained at a high level after the folkloric march, particularly when emotional fusion was high.

Study 3:
Perceived social support was higher in participants with high emotional synchrony, M ? 3.57, SD ? .54, than in participants with low emotional synchrony, M ? 3.30, SD ? .60, F(1, 224) ? 12.9, p ? .001, ?p
2 ? .055. Participants with high emotional
synchrony also reported stronger hope in reference to the move- ment, M ? 4.89, SD ? .26, than low emotional synchrony partic- ipants,M?4.18, SD?.20, F(1, 224)?8.97, p?.003, ?p
2?.04.

Within the group of 15-M participants, we then examined how far perceived emotional synchrony correlated with the endorsement of 15-M values. As predicted, the more 15-M participants had experienced emotional synchrony during the collective events, the stronger was their endorsement of the various 15-M related values: solidarity, freedom, r(59) ? .39, p ? .001, dignity, r(59) ? .51, p ? .001, participation, r(59) ? .29, p ? .013, social justice, r(59) ? .61, p ? .001, and equity, r(59) ? .51, p ? .001. 

In line with Hypothesis 1, the results revealed that compared
with controls, participation in a protest movement was associated with stronger perceived emotional synchrony with others, as well as with stronger personal emotions such as hope and anger.

Confirming Hypothesis 2, higher perceived emotional synchrony with others was related to higher perceived social support, and wholly mediated the association between participation and social integration

These results were congruent with evidence from a meta-analysis carried out by van Zomeren, Postmes, and Spears (2008) that affective variables surpassed nonaffective ones as predictors of collective action

Study 4: Experimentally Induced Protest Demonstration
Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimentally induced collective protest demonstration or to a control individual activity executed in the simple copresence of others. Dependent measures involved collective self-esteem, feel- ing of fusion with the group, perceived emotional synchrony, and experience of flow—Previous studies have shown that flow experienced in a social situation elicited joyful experiences at a higher level than solitary flow (Walker, 2010). but it remained unspecified whether the observed positive outcomes were attributable to the experience of flow, or to perceived emotional synchrony, or to both at the same time. In the present study, our aim was to specify how far each of these variables correlated positively with the positive outcomes.

Results:
Multiple regression as well as Hayes and Preacher's (2014) procedures were used to test the mediation of emotional synchrony and flow. Both variables com- pletely mediated the effect of participation on collective self- esteem, which was no longer significant after the inclusion of the mediators. However, as observed in Figure 4, only flow showed a significant indirect effect on collective self-esteem

A complementary analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed significant differences between the experimental and control groups for collective self-esteem, F(1, 41) ? 3.97, p ? .05, ?p
2 ? .092, for identity fusion with the group experienced during the activity, F(1, 41)?7.37, p?.01, ?p2?.159, and for identity fusion with the group
assessed 1 week after the activity

After partici- pating in the action, collective self-esteem and identity fusion with the group increased in the collective condition compared to the control condition.

Moreover, perceived emotional synchrony and flow were higher during a collective activity than during the individual one, confirming Walker's (2010) findings

perceived emotional synchrony correlated with flow and with identity fusion experi- enced during demonstrations

However, flow was not related to identity fusion—the latter being significantly associated only with perceived synchrony and with emotional contagion

the more participants experienced emotional synchrony in the collective situation, the stronger the various positive effects considered by the model would be. Thus, whether they referred to participants in folkloric marches or to demonstrators in a sociopolitical conflict, the results consistently supported our view that a higher level of perceived emotional synchrony among participants in the collective event predicts higher levels in all four types of positive outcomes measured after the event

These findings were con- gruent with those showing that emotions both strengthen previous beliefs and support the formation of new ones, and that positive emotions strengthen basic beliefs about the benevolence of the world (van Cappellen, Saroglou, Iweins, Piovesana, {\&} Fredrick- son, 2013).

The results of Studies 2 and 4 showed that during the course of a collective event, perceived emotional synchrony and flow state were strongly associated, and both correlated markedly with iden- tity fusion with the group

This profile of results confirms the existence of close links between identification with the group, shared emotions, and flow or absorption in the coordinated behav- ior during the collective activity

When experiencing a state of flow, members of a group concurrently identified more strongly with the group and experienced a stronger emotional bond with their coparticipants. Group flow as developed among marchers and demonstrators stimulated the synchronicity between participants and thereby created the conditions for building stronger groups. Team flow experienced in sports (e.g., basketball or volleyball) was expressed as “we were in synchrony with one another” (Schiepe-Tiska {\&} Engerser, 2011). Our studies substantiated Biasutti's (2011) claim that in collective or group flow:

"Sharing emotions and feelings with the other members of the group is important, in order to synchronize mentally and generate group strength. During flow performance there is attunement to self and other. The connection between group and individual flow creates an interesting dynamic in which the group flow },

abstract = {(from the chapter) Autotelic experiences, popularly known as flow, are associated with enhanced or even optimal performance. They occur when one becomes so deeply engrossed in a task and pursues it with such passion that all else disappears, including any sense of the passage of time or the worry of failure. Attention and action in such an autotelic state seem to flow effortlessly, and the task, whichever it may be, is performed without strain or effort to the best of the person's ability. We don't know what makes flow come and go, so to speak. Without some decent grasp of how to induce it, preferably on command, and maintain it, preferably in those all-important critical moments, athletes cannot reliably take advantage of it on their way to glory, gold, or other rewards, to say nothing of that place in history. Theories of attention and action, such as those by Kahneman (1973) or Sanders (1997), assume that higher task demands require more effort, both objectively, in terms of caloric consumption by the brain, and subjectively, in terms of perceived mental effort. In flow, however, the opposite appears to be the case. Here the perceived mental effort decreases, sometimes to the point of utter effortlessness, yet such seemingly automatic action is associated with superior performance. In other words, increased task demands are met not by an increase in mental effort but by a decrease. In flow states, in fact, action seems to be entirely outside of conscious awareness--the experience is often described as if it happens by itself, without any effort at all. What, then, might explain how a decrease in mental effort, especially in terms of attentional resources (according to Kahneman and Sanders), improves task performance? This chapter starts by summarizing previous work in the cognitive neurosciences that might account for this phenomenon. To understand the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the flow state requires that we fully appreciate the fact that the brain runs two functionally and anatomically distinct information-processing systems, the explicit and implicit systems, and that we rigorously apply the flexibility-efficiency trade-off that exists between these two systems to the computational problem of skilled motor performance. In addition, the transient hypofrontality theory is briefly outlined, which can account for the phenomenological features of autotelic experiences, such as, for instance, the merging of awareness and action, the exclusion from consciousness of distractions, the loss of the sense of time passing, and the lack of worry of possible failure. These are all higher order metacognitive processes that require, in order to be subtracted from consciousness, the downregulation of brain regions, primarily in the prefrontal cortex, that play a key role in the computation of these higher order thoughts and feelings in the first place. Finally, this chapter ends with a specific example from the sports sciences of how our understanding and appreciation of these mechanisms can inform training strategies to improve performance. To that end, we review the evidence linking perfectionism to success in competition. This is relevant because athletes who show negative perfectionist tendencies--that is, are overly self-critical, preoccupied with mistakes, and feel that a discrepancy exists between expectation and result--often fail to perform at their best. Their frequent inability to enter a state of effortless action, especially when the stakes are high, informs our understanding, in mechanistic terms, of how personality characteristics and individual differences influence the brain processes that control the execution of a skilled movement.

a powerful physiological mechanism helps the person keep distractions out, which makes the task readily controlled by the implicit system, as it should be anyway for optimal execu- tion. It is perhaps this additional mechanism that explains why autotelic experiences seem to be reported nowhere as frequently as in the arena of sports and exercise


flow states have escaped, in more ways than one, the attention of cognitive neuroscientists. The main reason for this oversight is perhaps the fact that the phenomenon is some- what of a paradox and remains difficult to explain according to traditional theories of attention and mental effort for the simple reason that they assume that better performance, on any task, is associated with increased conscious effort allocated to that task

the brain runs two functionally and anatomically distinct information-processing systems, the explicit and implicit systems, and that we rigorously apply the flexibility–efficiency trade-off that exists between these two systems to the computational problem of skilled motor performance:

- The explicit system is rule-based, its content can be expressed by verbal communication, and it is tied to conscious awareness:
-sophisticated system that represents knowledge in a higher
order format; that is, it represents additional information about the information, such as the fact that it contains the information it contains
-information to be broadcast to a global work space, making it usable for other parts of the system
complexity involved in organizing information in propositional and abstract terms is beyond any single brain structure's computational ability. Thus, the explicit system depends on several brain structures, each specialized in performing a particular step of information processing. Grossly oversimplified, the prefrontal cortex handles working memory, the hippocampus helps in the consolidation of that information, and permanent storage occurs in a plethora of cortical networks


- the implicit system is skill or experience based, its content is not verbalizable and can only be conveyed through task performance, and it is inaccessible to con- scious awareness
-more primitive and evolutionarily ancient system that does
not form higher order representations
-the explicit system, or any other functional system in the brain, does not know about knowledge imprinted in the implicit system, making it unavailable for representation in working memory and, thus, consciousness
-We must perform or execute implicit knowledge, which allows the explicit system to observe it and extract its essential components. Because the implicit system precludes metarepresentations, it is not burdened by the compu- tational complexity that comes with higher order thought, and a single brain struc- ture, such as the basal ganglia or cerebellum, can handle all information-processing steps (Dietrich 2004a)


the transient hypo- frontality theory is briefly outlined, which can account for the phenomenological features of autotelic experiences, such as, for instance, the merging of awareness and action, the exclusion from consciousness of distractions, the loss of the sense of time passing, and the lack of worry of possible failure

athletes who show negative perfectionist tendencies—that is, are overly self-critical, preoccupied with mistakes, and feel that a discrepancy exists between expectation and result—often fail to perform at their best

how personality characteristics and individual differences influence the brain processes that control the execution of a skilled movement

smooth feed-back-driven sensorimotor integration can produce extremely complex movement patterns that can serve an overall and/or higher goal (safety) yet require no more than the reaction to immediately preceding input. 

This is not unlike an outfielder trying to catch a fly ball. Starting with only a vague idea as to the ball's ultimate location, the player progressively approximates that location by continuously adjusting his or her movements based on updates of the ball's trajectory and speed as it approaches (McLeod et al. 2001)

The lack of metarepresentation precludes the system from calculating hypothetical future scenarios that would enable it to anticipate several steps in advance

Framed in computational terms, it becomes clear why such metarepresentation is unattainable for movement. Even for squirrels, the number of possible next moves is so astronomically high that future projections would quickly multiply to infinity. Such a nonlinear calculation is unpredictable, rendering the calculation of hypothetical future scenarios useless

a tennis match is a dynamic system with two moving targets. Although moment-to-moment events are completely unpredictable, the explicit system might settle to one or more strange attractors, such as the opponent's weak backhand. The explicit system can guide motor output toward such a strange attractor as long as the attractor is of a complexity that does not challenge the capacity limit of working memory

the implicit system must handle real-time movements, which it does on a moment-by-moment basis (Dietrich 2004a). This is especially so for complex patterns that have been auto- mated through hours of repetition

The more a motor skill is practiced and becomes habitual, a learning effect often known by the unfortunate misnomer muscle memory, the more the details of its execution come under the control of the implicit system in the basal ganglia, supplementary motor cortex, and lower brain centers in the brain stem (Jenkins et al. 1994)

Implicit and Explicit cognition in exercise:
Because a highly practiced skill is still performed by a conscious person, it is possible for the explicit system to partake in the skill's moment-to-moment execution. To stay with the example of tennis, this occurs when a player buffers any part of the game—consciously reflecting on the strokes, for instance—in a higher order representation and allows such analysis to guide movements

obvious that any amount of transfer of the actual motor execution from implicit to explicit control gravely affects its quality.

Roger Federer and serving with his non-dominant arm: The problem is that a tennis serve is too fast and too complicated to be executed by a mental representation that is general in nature and needs to apply its abstract knowledge, in real time no less, to a specific example

the implicit system owes its efficiency and speed to the fact that it does not form costly higher order representations of its knowledge

explicit system owes its flexibility to exactly this abstract representational format, which is the very feature that limits its use for applications, such as skilled movements, where time is of the essence

Each system can have a representation of the task require- ments, and there is, of course, a lot of anatomical cross-wiring, for various reasons, at several levels between these two systems, but their respective motor representa- tions are still fundamentally different (Dietrich 2008)

The paradox of effortless performance:
- Traditional models of attention have assumed that superior performance, in any task, is associated with increased attentional effort allocated to that task (Kahne- man 1973; Sanders 1997)
- Experiments on experts—skilled athletes, in most cases— have shown that once a motor skill is perfected, directing attention to a motor task is detrimental to its execution (e.g., Beilock and Carr 2005; Ravizza 1977).

This literature has broadly supported an inverse, instead of a linear, relationship between conscious attention to movement and performance (Fitts and Posner 1973)

computational models have shown that such an inverse relationship between focusing the mind on motor execution and actual motor execution is inherent in any dynamic system that operates with time-delayed feedback and is subjected to random perturbations (Milton et al., forthcoming; Insperger 2006)

effortless attention is an inherent feature of superior performance in such situations.

THT: views consciousness as composed of various attributes, such as self-reflection, attention, memory, percep- tion, and arousal, which are ordered in a functional hierarchy with the frontal lobe necessary for the top attributes

Because the prefrontal cortex is the neural substrate of the topmost layers, any change to conscious experience should affect, first and foremost, this structure, followed by a progressive shutdown of brain areas that contribute more basic cognitive functions

All altered states share phenomenological charac- teristics whose proper functions are regulated by the prefrontal cortex, such as time distortions, disinhibition from social norms, or a change in focused attention. This suggests that the neural mechanism common to all altered states is the transient downregulation of functional networks in the prefrontal cortex

The reduction of specific contents of conscious experience is known as phenomenological subtraction

altered states that are characterized by severe prefrontal hypoactivity—various drug states such as those induced by LSD or PCP, for instance—this change results in an extraordinarily bizarre phenomenology—hallucinations and delusions, most prominently

In altered states that are characterized by less prefrontal hypoactivity, such as long-distance running, meditation, or hypnosis, the modification to con- sciousness is much more subtle

the idea is that an individual simply functions on the highest layer of phenomenological consciousness that remains fully operational

Altered states of consciousness that are often presumed to be “higher” forms of consciousness, such as, for instance, transcendental meditation or the experi- ences reported after taking “mind-expanding” drugs, are therefore really “lower” states of consciousness, as they, functionally speaking, all reduce cognitive processes—atten- tion, working memory, temporal integration, and so forth—that are associated with the highest forms of consciousness

If all altered states share this common neural mechanism, why, then, does each feel unique?


Movement Chauvinism:

Bodily motion and flow in exercise contexts:
Complex locomotion, especially that involving large muscle groups, is an extremely demanding task in computational terms

Movement has never been understood, certainly not in cognitive psychology, as a biocomputation of the highest order. And, if one continues to think, as is customary in many fields, that motor control is a minor part of the brain's daily chores, it will be difficult to understand the consequences of movement for all regions of the brain, including—or especially—those not directly involved in moving the body.

Human artificers have managed to make machines that beat you in chess in eight-and-a-half moves with half of their transistors unplugged; yet they can't make a robot that walks nicely on two feet, let alone one that does a slam dunk

It certainly isn't because they can't make the movable equipment—arms, legs, joints, and so on (the main problem seems to be balance—Kuo et al. 2005)

not just an enormous amount of brain volume but also a very high number, in percentage terms, of neurons. Why, for instance, does the cerebellum have more neurons than any other structure in the brain, including the entire cerebral cortex?! What do you think all these neurons do? They do the brunt of the work of fine motor coordination, the very thing for which brute computational power is so critically needed

Let's try a third, slightly more sensitive intriguing fact. The male human brain is about 150 grams heavier than the female one. It is universally understood that this is due to the male's higher body mass. However, let's stop for a moment and think about what this really means. The male brain has, on average, 8{\%} to 10{\%} more brain mass only so that he can throw around what amounts to no more than a few more kilos of body mass. It is hard to believe that moving around a few more kilos of muscle and bone requires so much additional brain mass, especially in percentage terms, given that we are animals who are already copiously equipped with neuronal goo. But it does.

Finally, also keep in mind that the human motor system is more highly evolved
than that of other animals. Animals with much smaller brains can produce very complex movements, movements we find extraordinary, but what they cannot do is learn motor acts for which they are counterprepared, let alone to such a state of per- fection the way humans can. Just think of our ability to swim butterfly, pole vault, or play the violin, all actions we are not evolved to perform. Try teaching these to a chimp

The limits of the cardio-vascular system in exercise:
Yet during exercise, global blood flow to the brain, along with global cerebral metabolism and uptake of oxygen, remains constant (Ide and Secher 2000; Sokoloff 1992) or increases slightly (Secher et al. 2008). Thus, contrary to expectation, there is no evidence to suggest that the brain is the recipient of significant additional resources to offset the seemingly enormous metabolic demands that physical activity appears to require

The metabolic stress the brain is under during prolonged bodily motion causes a cascading ripple effect throughout the brain that facilitates— necessitates, actually—the inhibition of mental processes in the explicit system, which are, to repeat, supported primarily by computations in the prefrontal cortex

This eliminates metacognitive processes about the task more readily than when the exclu- sion of the same processes from phenomenal consciousness must be achieved purely by the muscle of focused attention, as is the case, for instance, in golf, meditation, or playing a musical instrument (see Dietrich 2003)

In other words, a powerful physio- logical mechanism helps the person keep distractions out, which makes the task readily controlled by the implicit system, as it should be anyway for optimal execu- tion. It is perhaps this additional mechanism that explains why autotelic experiences seem to be reported nowhere as frequently as in the arena of sports and exercise

Perfectionism:
disposition to regard anything short of perfection as unaccept-
able

evidence suggests, however, that two major dimensions of per- fectionism must be differentiated:

1. positive-striving perfectionism: perfectionist strivings, such as having high personal standards, setting exact benchmarks for one's performance, and having the drive to achieve excellence
- positively correlated with indicators of good adjustment, such as positive affect, endurance, and high aca- demic performance

2. self-critical perfectionism (Dunkley et al. 2003) and captures those facets of perfectionism that relate to critical self-evalu- ations of one's performance, such as constant concern over mistakes and negative feelings when expectations do not match results. 
- positively correlated with indicators of maladjustment, such as depression, stress, and anxiety (Stoeber and Otto 2006)


Stoll and colleagues (2008) investigated how perfectionism relates to performance by measuring performance increments over a series of trials in a new basketball training task

Conclusion: 
During the performance of a well-learned task, optimal performance is associated with maximal implic- itness (Dietrich 2004a)

The indirect benefits of flow:
rewarding effects of the positive experience that accompanies flow. According to Csikszentmihalyi and colleagues (2005, 602), this positive experience is a powerful motivating force: “When individuals are fully involved in an activity, they tend to find the activity enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding.” Because activities that have been rewarded are more likely to be performed again, the experience of effortlessly performing a task is likely to have a strong positive effect on motivation

As the activ- ity is performed again, individuals find greater challenges in the task, which results in further skill development, more competence, and greater performance (Csikszent- mihalyi and Larson 1987; Wong and Csikszentmihalyi 1991). In other words, the positive experience quality of flow has an indirect effect on performance by first influ- encing the motivation to perform the activity again, which then, in a second step, directly enhances the performance itself.

Perfectionism and motivation for action/performance:
perfectionism are extrinsically motivated, and their action is driven by a focus on outcomes and consequences (worrying about failure, ruminating, outperforming others, comparing themselves with others, experiencing competitive anxiety, having negative reactions to imperfection, being overly self-critical, etc.)

Because these are factors external to the actual action, they, when activated, interfere with the quality of the execution

Individuals with a positive disposition of perfectionism, on the other hand, are intrinsically motivated, and their action is driven by a focus not on ultimate objectives

but rather on the quality of the activity itself. Because these cognitive processes concern themselves with the action per se, they cannot be regarded as metacognitive processes about the task. In other words, these cognitive processes are not superfluous to the motor plan; indeed, they represent the very features that characterize the flow state. As such, they do not decrease the efficiency of a skilled movement and might even have the potential, in a novel task that is not yet implicitly executed, to enhance its acquisition.


during the acquisition of a new task, every- one is a novice, and a new task is not yet controlled by the implicit system because it has not had the exposure to the task demands to build a mental representation of the task's requirements, which can only be done by doing the task

As a consequence, extraneous factors cannot as readily mess up performance because the acquisition of a new motor task is heavily controlled by the explicit system anyway.

during the learning of a new task, perfectionism may enhance performance and lead to greater progress over time. This meshes well with results from other fields in which striving for perfection is associated with higher grades in students (Bieling et al. 2003; Stoeber and Rambow 2007) and better predicts results on aptitude tests (Stoeber and Kersting 2007). Again, the critical factor here seems to be that such tests, like novel tasks, are handled mostly by the explicit system, and interference by exter- nal factors, especially when they relate to positive striving and motivation, can enhance task performance, which is less likely for tasks that have been automated and thus executed implicitly.},

Results: Four distinctive mindfulness clusters were found based on their response on the MMS using cluster analysis. Marked differences in flow dispositions and mental skills adoption habits were observed between the high and the low mindfulness clusters. Those in the high mindfulness cluster scored significantly higher than the low mindfulness clusters in challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, concentration and loss of self-consciousness scores of the DFS-2 [Jackson, S.A., {\&} Eklund, R.C.

The high mindfulness clusters also scored significantly higher compared to the low mindfulness cluster in terms of attentional control, emotional control, goal setting and self-talk sub-scales of the TOPS.

abstract = {There are acquired motives of the addiction type which seem to be non-associative in nature. They all seem to involve affective phenomena caused by reinforcers, unconditioned stimuli or innate releasers. When such stimuli are repeatedly presented, at least three affective phenomena occur: (1) affective contrast effects, (2) affective habituation (tolerance), and (3) affective withdrawal syndromes. These phenomena can be precipitated either by pleasant or unpleasant events (positive or negative reinforcers). Whenever we see these three phenomena, we also see the development of an addictive cycle, a new motivational system. These phenomena are explained by an opponent-process theory of motivation which holds that there are affect control systems which oppose large departures from affective equilibrium. The control systems are strengthened by use and weakened by disuse. Current observations and experiments testing the theory are described for: (1) the growth of social attachment (imprinting) in ducklings; and (2) the growth of adjunctive behaviors. The findings so far support the theory.},

However, Kokoszka et al. have shown that mitochondria from livers of 'ANT-knockout' mice, in which the ANT has been genetically inactivated, still possess mtPTP activity. From this, the authors conclude that the ANT is a non-essential component of the mtPTP that may be dispensable for mtPTP-associated cell death. These results, which contradict previous evidence and cast doubt on a widely accepted model for the mtPTP (ref. 1), warrant scrutiny and call for a fundamental reappraisal of the role of the ANT in liver metabolism.},

abstract = {How does participation in a long-duration mass gathering (such as a pilgrimage event) impact well-being? There are good reasons to believe such collective events pose risks to health. There are risks associated with communicable diseases. Moreover, the physical conditions at such events (noise, crowding, harsh conditions) are often detrimental to well-being. Yet, at the same time, social psychological research suggests participation in group-related activities can impact well-being positively, and we therefore investigated if participating in a long-duration mass gathering can actually bring such benefits. In our research we studied one of the world's largest collective events - a demanding month-long Hindu religious festival in North India. Participants (comprising 416 pilgrims who attended the gathering for the whole month of its duration, and 127 controls who did not) completed measures of self-assessed well-being and symptoms of ill-health at two time points. The first was a month before the gathering commenced, the second was a month after it finished. We found that those participating in this collective event reported a longitudinal increase in well-being relative to those who did not participate. Our data therefore imply we should reconceptualise how mass gatherings impact individuals. Although such gatherings can entail significant health risks, the benefits for well-being also need recognition. Indeed, an exclusive focus on risk is misleading and limits our understanding of why such events may be so attractive. More importantly, as our research is longitudinal and includes a control group, our work adds robust evidence to the social psychological literature concerning the relationship between participation in social group activities and well-being.},

First, activating either personal or social identities of fused persons should increase their willingness to endorse extreme behaviors on behalf of the group. Second, because personal as well as social identities support group-related behaviors of fused persons, the 2 forms of identity may combine synergistically, fostering exceptionally high levels of extreme behavior. Support for these hypotheses came from 5 preliminary studies and 3 experiments. In particular, fused persons were more willing to fight or die for the group than nonfused persons, especially when their personal or social identities had been activated. The authors conclude that among fused persons, both the personal and social self may energize and direct group-related behavior.

abstract = {A large number of studies conducted in the last twenty years show that optimal experience is a positive and complex condition in which cognitive, motivational and emotional components coexist in a coherent and articulated reciprocal integration. By virtue of its positive psychological features, optimal experience has been sometimes misunderstood as a state which automatically brings about well-being and development. Several studies have disconfirmed this assumption, showing that the outcomes of optimal experience are not automatically positive. Rather, they vary according to the features of the associated activities and to the value system of the cultural environment. Researchers in this domain have been primarily devoted their attention to the structure of the activities that promote optimal experience, and to the goal pursuit they facilitate. Goals are given a prominent role in development in that they provide individuals with practical orientation and purpose in life. But something is missing in this framework: meaning. What do we know about the relationship between optimal experience and meaning making? Based on findings coming from different contexts and cultures, this paper tries to give optimal experience a role within the long-term process of meaning-making.},
annote = {From this perspective, optimal experience plays a twofold role: it supports the preferential replication of the associated activities throughout the individual life span, at the same time promoting the survival and spreading of such activities within the culture.



optimal experience does not automatically brings about well-being and development

outcomes vary according to the features of the associated activities and their role within the value system of the individuals and of their social environment

another dimension has to be taken into account in the investigation of optimal experience: meaning (Emmons, 2005). 

The interpretation of reality through the attribution of meanings to environmental and personal situations is a peculiar feature of human beings (Jablonka {\&} Lamb, 2005). 

meaning has to be considered at two levels: the individual and the cultural one

As reported by scholars from different disciplines (Bruni {\&} Porta, 2006; Peterson, Park, {\&} Sweeney, 2008; Ryff {\&} Keyes, 1995) good life is not necessarily related to good feelings. People can commit themselves to the cultivation of activities or to the pursuit of goals that they perceive as valuable, but that undermine their quality of life in the short term (Sen, 1992). The relevance of life activities and goals is related to the meaning individuals attribute to them (Emmons, 2005).

In periods of stress or change, high levels of meaning making are associated with low levels of subjective well-being (Park, 2005; Shmotkin, 2005).

Nevertheless, a meaning centered coping strategy promotes adjustment and well-being in stressful situations, such as chronic disease (Emmons, Colby, {\&} Kaiser, 1998; Folkman {\&} Greer, 2000)

In Antonovsky's construct of Sence of Coherence (SOC; Antonovsky, 1987), the attribution of meaning to life events plays a paramount role. It is related to the capacity to establish a coherence among different sensorial stimuli, referring them to a unitary and shared shape, or Gestalt (Amrikhan {\&} Greaves, 2003)

Specific activities or goals do not necessarily have the same meaning or function in different cultures: therefore, we should not expect them to have an invariant relation to well-being or individual development (Deci {\&} Ryan, 2000)

Individuals differ in their behavior and goal orientation according to their cultural background.

Differences substantially concern the weight and the meaning attributed to collective norms, daily activities, and social roles (Triandis, 1994; Massimini {\&} Delle Fave, 2000)

The person is connected to the cultural meaningful world through processes of internalization and externalization (Vaalsiner, 1998, 2007). Individual experience of the world “transforms collective-cultural meanings into a personal-cultural system of sense” (Vaalsiner, 2007, p. 62), which undergoes a personal reconstruction and can be externalized through behaviors, goals, and strivings. Through meaning making humans organize their experience moment by moment (Kegan, 1994), integrating events and information into their own life history and developmental trajectory (Singer, 2004)

Moreover, meaning making is a dynamic process: throughout their lives,
individuals ceaselessly revise their experiences, attribute new meanings to them, expand or narrow their own meaning system.

Individuals can attribute meaning to activities that are not valued or approved by the cultural context, there is the case of consistency (with the social context) or discrepency"

In case of consistency, the social context will support individuals' investment of resources on that activity, encouraging its cultivation, and eventually deriving benefits from the competencies individuals develop in that activity

In case of discrepancy, a conflict can arise between the individual's meaning making process and the social expectations, leading the person to marginalization.

psychological selection:
Due to the psychological rewards provided by this condition, the associated activities will be preferentially replicated and cultivated in the long run, thus affecting both the developmental trajectory of the individuals – their psychological selection pattern – and their social integration and participation


Study:
The findings were gathered by means of Flow Questionnaire (FQ, Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2004; Massimini, Csikszentmihalyi, {\&} Delle Fave, 1988) and Life Theme Questionnaire (LT, Csikszentmihalyi {\&} Beattie, 1979; Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2003a)

cultures shape individuals' well-being, both providing a meaning-making system for daily events and interactions, and fostering or limiting opportunities for growth and self- expression (Diener, Oishi, {\&} Lucas, 2003; Ryan {\&} Deci, 2001; Uchida, Norasakkunkit, {\&} Kitayama, 2004).

Cross-cultural uniformity:
A study involving over 900 participants from different continents (Delle Fave, 2007) highlighted some shared cross-cultural aspects, such as the psychological features of optimal experience, and the categories of activities primarily associated with it.

Productive activities (work and study) and structured leisure (sports, arts and crafts, hobbies) were reported as prominent opportunities for optimal experience.

Cultural specificities: 
some activity categories were only or prominently associated with optimal experience by participants belonging to a specific culture (Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2004). 

Rom people emphasized family interactions as major opportunities for optimal experience. This is not surprising, since the family represents the core unit of Rom communities. Rom extended families maintain strong ties even through long distances; social cohesion is supported through marriages and a strong social hierarchy based on age; knowledge is passed on through oral teachings and vertical transmission of behavioral norms, while little relevance is attributed to formal education (Delle Fave, Bassi, {\&} Massimini, 2003)

Indoneasian associated optimal experience with religious practice more frequently than the other samples.

Iranian participants did not report any opportunity for optimal experience in the domain of sports, arts and crafts, while they primarily quoted reading, an activity that supports development through acquisition of
knowledge and competences, also promoting autonomous
information processing.

cross-cultural study on adolescents further highlighted the impact of the weight and meaning attributed by cultures to specific domains on individual psychological selection [Data were collected through FQ and LT among girls attending high school in Nepal, Italy, and Uganda (Delle Fave, Bassi, Cavallo, {\&} Stokart, 2007; Stokart, Cavallo, Fianco, {\&} Lombardi, 2007)]

Girls from Italy and Nepal lived in urban areas with their families. Italian adolescents primarily associated optimal experience with structured leisure activities such as sport, arts and hobbies, and less frequently with studying. Nepalese teenagers prominently associated optimal experience with learning tasks (Nag, White, {\&} Peet, 1980). 

Participants from Uganda lived in a Catholic boarding school; all of them came from poor rural villages, where female illiteracy and early marriage are the rule. Girls from Uganda referred with similar frequencies to study and structured leisure. 

Religious practices were associated with optimal experience by Nepalese and Ugandian girls, while only Nepalese teenagers referred to family interactions (Stokart et al., 2007; Delle Fave et al., 2007).

Optimal Experience and Learning:
The association of optimal experience with studying represents an important
prerequisite for adolescents' future ability to cope with the challenges of the productive world (Csikszentmihalyi, Rathunde, {\&} Whalen, 1993; Larson, 2000)

Learning can be a very rich source of engagement, personal satisfaction, and meaningful information (Delle Fave, 2004). Its effectiveness as an opportunity for optimal experience can facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge and the active

However, the cultural meaning attributed to formal education can influence its attractiveness as an opportunity for resource investment. In Western countries studying is a mandatory activity; nevertheless, several nations are facing problems such as students' poor performance and drop-out from high schools.

As concerns our participants, Italian girls took formal education for granted. On the contrary, students from Nepal and Uganda perceived education as a precious opportunity to get a good job and to achieve a prestigious social role (Rosenbaum, Kariya, Settersten, {\&} Maier, 1990).

leisure, structured activities such as reading, sport, arts, and hobbies help
adolescents organize their free time, and support the search for high challenges and active involvement (Verma {\&} Sharma, 2003; Delle Fave {\&} Bassi, 2003)

Individual Meaning: The Commitment to Faith
In Western countries, the growing secularization has made religious beliefs and practice the outcome of an individual choice, rather than of cultural influences

religious practice as an opportunity for optimal experience, and its influence on psychological selection and meaning making among a group of Italian Catholic adults, comprising lay people and people consecrated in various religious institutions (Coppa {\&} Delle Fave, 2007)

Optimal experience was reported by 97{\%} of the participants, and it was most frequently associated with religious practice, followed by sport and hobbies, and by reading

During religious practice participants reported significantly higher values of intrinsic motivation, perceived challenges, and self-consciousness, as well as significant lower scores of clear goals. These findings can be interpreted considering faith as the core of the individual meaning making process for these participants.

faith represents the inner and intrinsic spring of religious practice participants emphasized their free adherence to a personal relationship to God

The Role of Family in Adolescence 

teens face internal and interpersonal conflicts on the path toward adulthood. Such turmoil can be smoothed by a stable and supportive family context, which enables adolescents to find their own way in the world, and to look for opportunities for action and engagement in the domains of education, hobbies, peer relations and personal growth (Cobb, 1996; Seiffge-Krenke, 1995; Simons et al., 1996).

previous development of a positive attachment relationship with parents is a prerequisite for the unfolding of exploratory behavior and for the search for meanings (Steinberg, 1987; Sokol-Katz, Dunham, {\&} Zimmerman, 1997).

the negative effect of dysfunctional attachment patterns and family conflicts on adolescents' autonomy and identity building (Allen et al., 1996; Osuna, Alarcon, {\&} Luna, 1992).

Youth living in problematic families have to search for adult models in a social environment which is not always supportive or edifying, without guides to sufficiently rely upon, especially from the affective and developmental point of view

study of family suypport and meaning making:
girls living at home and girls entrusted to Institutions for Custody of Minors because of severe family maladjustment (Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2000). 

Girls living at home most frequently reported sports and hobbies, followed by studying, reading, and the use of media. The institutionalized adolescents primarily reported socialization – mostly with peers - and the use of media, followed by spending time with the boyfriend.

Peers played the role of advisors and models in the development of institutionalized girls, providing them with behavioral instructions, values, goals and a meaning making system not necessarily suited to the challenges and features of the adult life

Besides socialization, girls living in institution associated optimal experience with leisure activities characterized by short-term relevance and low level of complexity, such as watching TV and listening to music. These activities belong to the domain of relaxed leisure: they promote fun, but also passiveness, disengagement,
low levels of affect and involvement (Kubey {\&} Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Delle Fave {\&} Bassi, 2000). While girls living at home associated optimal experience with creative and demanding activities, institutionalized girls were exposed to opportunities for action low in complexity and in potential for growth promotion (Larson, 2000; Delle Fave {\&} Bassi, 2003; Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2005a)

The most striking results were obtained with a group of teenagers living in the streets of Nairobi, Kenya: only 2 participants out of 13 reported optimal experiences in their lives (Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2005b). Such a lack of optimal experiences and complex challenges exposes these adolescents to the risk of getting involved in deviant and criminal activities. These activities are often structured and engaging enough to require skills refinement, control of the situation and focused attention, thus providing optimal experiences and channelling the individual resources towards goals that are however in contrast with cultural meanings and values

Getting Hooked: Drug Addiction and the Loss of Meaning
the psychological effects of drug intake and optimal experience show several similarities
Besides substance-related variations, drugs induce the perception of a merging between individual and situation, deep involvement, isolation from the surrounding world, and psychophysical well-being

Comparison study: study with FQ among addicts undergoing treatment with substitute substances (such as methadone) and ex-addicts living in detoxification communities (Delle Fave {\&} Massimini, 2003b).

The psychological features of optimal experience during drug intake, and during other activities draw interesting results

after drug intake participants reported lower levels of perceived challenges, control of the situation, intrinsic motivation, relaxation, goal pursuit and control of the situation. These differences can be primarily related to the passive nature of the experience arising after drug intake

Addicts do not feel relaxed or intrinsically motivated during drug intake, since they need substances to avoid organic and mental withdrawal symptoms, and to get relief from craving symptoms. Finally, as concerns goals, the only aim of addicts is to passively experience drug effects, and to find ways to get the substance as soon as they need it

These results suggest that drug induces mimetic or pseudo-optimal
experiences, deceiving consciousness with an ephemeral perception of well-being, though followed by negative long-term consequences. From this perspective, it is not surprising that addicts centre their life upon drug, investing their resources in searching and using it as vehicle of rewarding and positive feelings

Optimal experience is a very powerful instrument to support this process. It can help individuals to channel their resources and refine their skills. It facilitates the engagement in meaningful activities through effortless concentration and intrinsic motivation. Therefore, any intervention to promote well-being of individuals and groups should aim at providing both opportunities for optimal experience, and awareness of their individual and collective meaning.},

annote = {What are some of the potential mechanisms that help bond individual persons into strong cohesive groups?
- Whatever these mechanisms may be, they must be deeply rooted in our evolu- tionary past and must involve highly effective social technologies derived from our common biology

SELF{\_}HARM? 

Avoiding suffering (e.g., physical and emo- tional pain or discomfort) is a fundamental evolutionary drive of all biological entities: Any organism will be motivated to avoid negative bodily states and will attempt to maximize pleasant states to the extent that is not interfering with other biological necessities.

Here we propose that these two evolutionary puzzles of social bonding and self-inflicted suffering may actually be related...
inflicting and experiencing negative states in social settings may serve as a particular social technology that humans have co-opted for creating cohesive in-groups


Pain, Fatigue, and Suffering as Psycho-Biological Processes:

Sensory and affective components of pain: 
Psychological experience of pain and fatigue as well as other emotional reactions associated with human suffering are not directly correlated with objective physical and physiological triggers: Nerve impulses arriving from the periphery are processed across various brain areas in the thalamus, limbic system and cortex. Sensory input is processed in parallel across these brain networks and sensory, affective and cognitive information from these various areas is integrated into the subjective perception of pain and suffering.
pain as a psychological experience is not directly related to the physical damage to tissue or bone that may occur during extreme collective rituals. 

RAH model of acute exercise (Dietrich and Audiffren, 2011) proposes that endurance activities lead to a dis- engagement of higher-order prefrontal cortex areas and down-regulate emo- tional processing, but do not compromise the functioning of implicit systems related to optimal motor execution:
strenuous and high-intensity activities (and often in combination with restrictions in food and fluid intake) will continue to operate at a physi- cal level (e.g., walking long-distances, pulling or carrying heavy objects), but are unable to process more complex information or experience emotional reactions of pain or discomfort

Pain is likely linked to psychological motivations. One classic observation has been the ritualistic cleansing and purification of the body through pain

A number of theoretical models have been developed that suggest that costly behaviour serves as a signal- ling devise that binds communities together. Yet, no empirical proof of such mechanisms has been provided (348)

Xygalatis et al. (2013): 
Low ordeal, then high ordeal a few days before the main high ordeal ritual: 
Although random assignment was obviously not possible in a naturalistic study, the setting or the ritual allowed for random selection, i.e., each subject took part in both rituals but participated in the study only in one instance.

Results:
main effect of group on donation: significant difference between high and low-ordeal group
More importantly, perceptions of pain were significantly correlated with
the amount donated (r = 0.36, p {\textless} 0.01).
Yet, there was a negative relationship between perceived dif- ficulty of carrying the “kavadi” and how religious individuals felt: r = −0.28, p {\textless} 0.01, N = 88. 
The more pain individuals perceived in the ritual, the higher their donations to the temple.
adjusting for religiosity or how often participants visited the temple did not affect the donation and pain findings (Figure 3).
Yet, there was a negative relationship between perceived dif- ficulty of carrying the “kavadi” and how religious individuals felt: r = −0.28, p {\textless} 0.01, N = 88. In other words, the more religious individuals reported greater ease of performing the high-ordeal acts of worship.

(Fischer and Kruekaew, in preparation): Vegetarian Festival in Thailand
When asked after the ritual about their levels of religiosity and experienced pain of the piercing, a negative correlation emerged for the high ordeal participants: r = −0.40, p {\textless} 0.05, N = 41. More religious individuals reported less pain 

Fusion and pain? more fusion, less pain? 

Individual Agency versus Social Functions:

Moral cleansing function of pain (Bastian et al. 2011):
- spiritually impure individuals suffer more during extreme rituals (Cohen, 2001; Xygalatas, 2012)

negative association between pain, suf- fering and religiosity in both Hindu and Buddhist contexts presented above, we could speculate that those individuals who feel more guilt or believe that they have committed some moral transgression (they feel they have failed in their religious duties) are more likely to engage in these high-ordeal acts and then experience them as more painful

this experienced pain, driven by perceptions of moral failure, is then associated with a motivation to donate more to the in-group

Overall, we may expect even greater efforts to conform to and reinforce moral norms (e.g., punish transgressors of perceived norms) among individuals engaging in this high-ordeal rituals due to their motivation to purify and cleanse themselves

-- this is the wild insecurity of rugby teams at the start of the season when there is a willingness, based on insecurity, to conform or reinforce moral norms? 

For observers, the apparent supernatural powers of the high-ordeal participants may create a sense of awe, leading to greater supernatural beliefs (Valdesolo and Graham, 2014)

The increased religiousness should also lead to greater identification with the group of believers and social bonding

observers with greater levels of empathetic reactions will be more drawn into the group (cf., Konvalinka et al., 2011; Xygalatas et al., 2013) and biologically related observers will be likely to experience strong emotional reactions to the display of ordeal (Konvalinka et al., 2011; Fischer et al., 2014)

Therefore, the subjective experience of pain and suffering shared by both observers and participants may be an important psychological mechanism in motivating individuals to perform and witness these rituals as well as the functionality of the rituals at the group level

the social context (feelings of personal shortcomings through internalization of social norms and expectations) motivates individual agency of publicly visible high ordeal actions, which then reinforces social bonds in the collective and acts as a social reinforcement mechanism: through the public performance of these devotional acts, individual-level agency that involves complex biological processes of pain perception results into self-rein- forcing social mechanisms that bind groups together

Group-level selection? 
Given the differential experience of pain, together with the motivational appeal of hurt- ing oneself to achieve moral cleansing, the selective advantage operates pri- marily at the individual level. Engaging in these rituals allowed people to gain status within the group and avoid marginalization

These acts then have social ramifications by bringing individuals closer together. However, this important group-level outcome would not have been possible without the individual- level processes of pain perception that are biologically rooted and common to all humans.

Our analysis suggests that extreme rituals are tapping on psycho- biological pain processes that provide a selective advantage to individu- als, which only then provides a secondary advantage at the group level


It has often been noted that spiritually impure individuals suffer more during extreme rituals (Cohen, 2001; Xygalatas, 2012). C},

Across 3 experiments, people from a face culture absorbed the judgments of other people into their private self-definitions. Particularly important for people from a face culture are public representations--knowledge that is shared and known to be shared about someone. In contrast, people from a dignity culture try to preserve the sovereign self by not letting others define them. In the 3 experiments, dignity culture participants showed a studied indifference to the judgments of their peers, ignoring peers' assessments--whether those assessments were public or private, were positive or negative, or were made by qualified peers or unqualified peers.

On this definition of morality, conservative opposition to social justice programs appears to be immoral, and has been explained as a product of various non-moral processes such as system justification or social dominance orientation. In this article we argue that, from an anthropological perspective, the moral domain is usually much broader, encompassing many more aspects of social life and valuing institutions as much or more than individuals. We present theoretical and empirical reasons for believing that there are five psychological systems that provide the foundations for the world's many moralities. The five foundations are psychological preparations for detecting and reacting emotionally to issues related to harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Political liberals have moral intuitions primarily based upon the first two foundations, and therefore misunderstand the moral motivations of political conservatives, who generally rely upon all five foundations.},

In a selective review of theoretical and empirical work, we define self and what the self does, define culture and how it constitutes the self (and vice versa), define independence and interdependence and determine how they shape psychological functioning, and examine the continuing challenges and controversies in the study of culture and self. We propose that a self is the "me" at the center of experience--a continually developing sense of awareness and agency that guides actions and takes shape as the individual, both brain and body, becomes attuned to various environments. Selves incorporate the patterning of their various environments and thus confer particular and culture-specific form and function to the psychological processes they organize (e.g., attention, perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, interpersonal relationship, group). In turn, as selves engage with their sociocultural contexts, they reinforce and sometimes change the ideas, practices, and institutions of these environments.},

Consistent with the assumption that lower social standing is associated with greater frustration stemming from life adversities and blocked goals, Americans with lower social status expressed more anger, with the relationship mediated by the extent of frustration. In contrast, consistent with the assumption that higher social standing affords a privilege to display anger, Japanese with higher social status expressed more anger, with the relationship mediated by decision-making authority. As expected, anger expression was predicted by subjective social status among Americans and by objective social status among Japanese.

Study 1, an analysis of media coverage of the 2000 and 2002 Olympics, shows that in both Japanese and American contexts, performance is construed mainly in terms of the actions of persons. However, Japanese and American accounts differ in their explanations of the nature and source of intentional agency, that is, in their models of agency. In Japanese contexts, agency is construed as conjoint and simultaneously implicates athletes' personal attributes (both positive and negative), background, and social and emotional experience. In American contexts, agency is construed as disjoint, separate from athletes' background or social and emotional experience; performance is explained primarily through positive personal characteristics and features of the competition. Study 2, in which participants chose information to be included in an athlete's description, confirms these findings. Differences in the construction of agency are reflected in and fostered by common cultural products (e.g., television accounts).},

The second hypothesis holds that people achieve wellbeing and health through actualizing the respective cultural mandates in their modes of being. As predicted, the strongest predictor of wellbeing and health was personal control in the United States, but the absence of relational strain in Japan.

Drawing on the power and authenticity literatures, however, we predicted the opposite relationship. Because power increases the correspondence between internal states and behavior, we hypothesized that power enhances subjective well-being (SWB) by leading people to feel more authentic. Across four surveys representing markedly different primary social roles (general, work, romantic-relationship, and friendship surveys; Study 1), and in an experiment (Study 2a), we found consistent evidence that experiencing power leads to greater SWB. Moreover, authenticity mediated this effect. Further establishing the causal importance of authenticity, a final experiment (Study 2b), in which authenticity was manipulated, demonstrated that greater authenticity directly increased SWB. Although striving for power lowers well-being, these results demonstrate the pervasive positive psychological effects of having power, and indicate the importance of spreading power to enhance collective well-being.},

In Study 1, we measured police officers' subjective social status and had them engage in a stressful task during which we measured cardiovascular and neuroendocrine reactivity. In Study 2, we manipulated social status and examined physiological reactivity and performance outcomes to explore links among status, performance, and physiological reactivity. Results indicated that higher social status (whether measured or manipulated) was associated with approach-oriented physiology (Studies 1 and 2) and better performance (Study 2) relative to lower status. These findings point to acute reactivity as one possible causal mechanism to better physical health among those higher in social status.},

Individuals from 142 countries (N = 150,048) were surveyed about their emotions, health, hunger, shelter, and threats to safety. Both positive and negative emotions exhibited unique, moderate effects on self-reported health, and together, they accounted for 46.1{\%} of the variance. These associations were stronger than the relative impact of hunger, homelessness, and threats to safety and were not simply attributable to countries' gross domestic products (GDPs). Furthermore, connections between positive emotion and health were stronger in low-GDP countries than in high-GDP countries. Our findings suggest that emotion matters for health around the globe and may in fact be more critical in less-developed areas.},

abstract = {Chinese ways of dealing with seeming contradictions result in a dialectical or compromise approach—retaining basic elements of opposing perspectives by seeking a "middle way." On the other hand, European–American ways, deriving from a lay version of Aristotelian logic, result in a differentiation model that polarized contradictory perspectives in an effort to determine which factor is position is correct. Five empirical studies showed that dialectical thinking is a form of folk wisdom in Chinese culture: Chinese participants preferred dialectical proverbs containing seeming contradictions more than did American participants. Chinese participants also preferred dialectical resolutions to social conflicts and preferred dialectical arguments over classical Western logical arguments. Furthermore, when 2 apparently contradictory propositions were presented, American participants polarized their views, and Chinese participants were moderately accepting of of both propositions. Origins of these cultural differences and their implications for human reasoning in general are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Dozens of studies in different nations have revealed that socioeconomic status only weakly predicts an individual's subjective well-being (SWB). These results imply that although the pursuit of social status is a fundamental human motivation, achieving high status has little impact on one's SWB. However, we propose that sociometric status—the respect and admiration one has in face-to-face groups (e.g., among friends or coworkers)—has a stronger effect on SWB than does socioeconomic status. Using correlational, experimental, and longitudinal methodologies, four studies found consistent evidence for a local-ladder effect: Sociometric status significantly predicted satisfaction with life and the experience of positive and negative emotions. Longitudinally, as sociometric status rose or fell, SWB rose or fell accordingly. Furthermore, these effects were driven by feelings of power and social acceptance. Overall, individuals' sociometric status matters more to their SWB than does their socioeconomic status.},

We also predicted an effect of ritual intensity on social identifica- tion. Classical findings from psychology (Aronson {\&} Mills, 1959; Festinger, 1957; Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, {\&} Flament, 1971) and evolutionary perspectives on parochial altruism (Choi {\&} Bowles, 2007; Ginges, Hansen, {\&} Norenzayan, 2009) suggest that ritual intensity is associated with sub- group identification. However, recent intergroup theories (Gaertner {\&} Dovidio, 2000; Hornsey {\&} Hogg, 2000) sug- gest that in Hindu-dominated Mauritius, where Thaipusam is celebrated on a national scale, the ritual of the majority religious group affirms the inclusive nature of the super- ordinate Mauritian national identity},
annote = {These findings support long-standing anthropological conjectures about the cooperative effects of intense rituals (Durkheim, 1912). We offer the first natural demon- stration that suffering predicts prosociality by capitalizing on intense, real-world stimuli that would be hard to manipulate in the laboratory

results suggest that costly displays of group commitment (though apparently wasteful) may be conserved because they intensify pro- social behaviors and attitudes among the wider commu- nity (Henrich, 2009; Sosis {\&} Bressler, 2003)


Method:

prosociality operationalised as behaviour (charity) and attitudes (social identification).

Identity was measured on a scale anchored by the parochial ethnic-religious Hindu identity at one end and by the superordinate inclusive national Mauritian identity at the other. 


high-ordeal group (performers and
observers), we performed a bootstrapping analysis and found that pain correlated with donations (r = .36, p {\textless} .01). Notably, this effect held even after controlling for age, religiosity, and temple attendance

higher levels of perceived pain were directly associated with greater donations

The number of piercings did not predict how much participants donated, which sug- gests that effects were driven by subjective experiences of pain (Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2011)

In line with modern intergroup theories, low-ordeal participants expressed the most parochial identities (M = 1.71, SD = 6.50), seeing themselves as more Hindu than high-ordeal observers (M = 3.03, SD = 6.50) and high- ordeal performers (M = 7.13, SD = 3.46), who both favored the more inclusive Mauritian identity


The difference between participants in the low-ordeal ritual and high-ordeal ritual (perform- ers and observers combined) was significant, t(84) = 2.11, p {\textless} .05, as was that between high-ordeal observers and performers, t(49) = 2.54, p {\textless} .05
the intensity of the ordeal amplified the more inclusive social identity

greater judgments of pain predicted more inclusive identities (r = .28, 95{\%} CI = [.01, .53], p {\textless} .05)

Specific themes were expected to relate differentially to two forms of personality development (social-cognitive maturity and social-emotional well-being) and to transition satisfaction. Integrative themes correlated primarily with social-cognitive maturity (ego development; Loevinger, 1976), whereas intrinsic themes correlated primarily with social-emotional well-being. Agentic-growth themes correlated primarily with transition satisfaction, whereas communal-growth themes correlated primarily with global well-being. Themes of agentic and communal growth also differentiated the two types of transitions studied-changes in careers and changes in religions-in ways that both supported and contradicted traditional notions of those transitions. We discuss these findings in terms of narrative meaning making, the mature and happy person, and intentional self-development via life transitions.},

abstract = {How do people feel during extreme collective rituals? Despite longstanding speculation, few studies have attempted to quantify ritual experiences. Using a novel pre/post design, we quantified physiological fluctuations (heart rates) and self-reported affective states from a collective fire-walking ritual in a Mauritian Hindu community. Specifically, we compared changes in levels of happiness, fatigue, and heart rate reactivity among high-ordeal participants (fire-walkers), low-ordeal participants (non-fire-walking participants with familial bonds to fire-walkers) and spectators (unrelated/unknown to the fire-walkers). We observed that fire-walkers experienced the highest increase in heart rate and reported greater happiness post-ritual compared to low-ordeal participants and spectators. Low-ordeal participants reported increased fatigue after the ritual compared to both fire-walkers and spectators, suggesting empathetic identification effects. Thus, witnessing the ritualistic suffering of loved ones may be more exhausting than experiencing suffering oneself. The findings demonstrate that the level of ritual involvement is important for shaping affective responses to collective rituals. Enduring a ritual ordeal is associated with greater happiness, whereas observing a loved-one endure a ritual ordeal is associated with greater fatigue post-ritual.},
annote = {Ritual --{\textgreater} Collective effervescence: a shared emotional experience that binds communities together

Using a novel quasi-experimental pre-post design, demonstrated that ritual modulates affective experience, broadly in line with anthropological theories of collective ritual [1,2]. Happiness linearly increased from spectators to low-ordeal performers and high-ordeal performers after the ritual. Fatigue was highest among low-ordeal performers post-ritual, but high-ordeal participants and spectators did not differ in experienced fatigue after the ritual.

High-ordeal participants engage in extreme actions for specific purposes (e.g., moral cleansing, purification, gratitude) [31].



Haidt: "Hive hypothesis" lose themselves in collective rituals, emphasizing the positive affective aspects of these events
Whitehouse: rituals may invoke both positive and negative affective states, with the latter being particularly powerful in eliciting in-group cohesion and coordination, especially in traditional societies

Against "effervescence models" - physical and psychological hardships endured by participants at extreme rituals would suggest experiences of increased fatigue and discontent

witnessing such apparent suffering might plausibly evoke negative affective states, leading to experiences of what might be termed ‘‘empathetic exhaustion.''

how participants and spectators report their affective reactions to extreme rituals?

witnessing extreme ritual performances by close kin may induce greater suffering than actually performing the ritual. This supports the collective effervescence hypothesis (Hypothesis 2)


Research Context:
Thimithi festival is widely celebrated in honour of the Mother Goddess, Mauritius 
devotees engage in body piercings that can vary from needles through the tongue and forehead to skewers 1–2 cm in diameter through the cheeks
"trance-like states during the procession"
Upon reaching the temple, fire- walkers walk on the edges of swords before ending their procession by walking over a bed of glowing charcoal
Ends with a common meal

Study Design:
effects of active and passive participation in
this ritual on self-reported affect and physiological response, quantified as heart-rate reactivity

High/Low ordeal participants (body piercing and firewalking versus barefoot walking, fasting, high and low ordeal participants were related through kinship)
and control (spectators - who were neither biologically nor socially related to participants and only observed the fire-walk)

Affect can be differentiated by
valence (pleasant – unpleasant) and 
arousal (activation – deactivation)


Hypothesis 1. There is a decrease in happiness and an increase in fatigue post-ritual moving from high-ordeal partici- pants to low-ordeal participants to spectators.

Effervescence Hypotheses
Hypothesis 2. Heart rates will increase linearly with the ritual involvement in the groups, with highest levels of heart-rate increases among fire-walkers. 
Hypothesis 3. Post-ritual, highest levels of happiness are reported by high-ordeal participants, followed by low-ordeal participants and then spectators. Conversely, highest levels of fatigue are reported by spectators, followed by low-ordeal participants and lowest levels are predicted for high-ordeal participants.
Hypothesis 4. At time 2, low-ordeal participants will report
the highest level of fatigue compared to both high-ordeal participants and spectators, who do not differ from each other.


Results:

1. happiness, we observed a moderate effect size for timeXinvolvement in the ritual: F(2,57)=2.46, p=.09
there was no difference in happiness between the groups before the ritual: F(2,60)=.12, p=.88, partial g2=.004, but the groups differed post-ritual: F(2,60)=4.19, p,.05, partial g2=.123.
H3: a significant linear trend (p,.01, raw scores and controlling for Time 1 scores) showed that fire-walkers were happiest followed by low-ordeal participants (Madjusted=16.75, SE=.90) and spectators (Mad- justed=14.65, SE=.93).
The changes in happiness within groups were not significantly different between time 1 and 2
participants to spectators, the interaction was significant: with high and low-ordeal participants overall reporting higher happiness after the ritual compared to spectators (Mad- justed=15.77, SE=.67). 

2. found the predicted time6ritual involvement interaction for fatigue
a main effect of ritual involvement on time 1 scores, with spectators experiencing higher fatigue (M=9.52, SD=1.35) compared to both high and low-ordeal participants.
This is expected - ritual participants would of course be excited to participate in the ritual, and therefore not report feelings of fatigue...
At time 2, low-ordeal participants experienced higher fatigue compared to spectators and high-ordeal participants 
increase in fatigue was largest and significant among low-ordeal participants, but not significant among fire-walkers and spectators (H4)

3. main effects of time F(1,62)=15.44, p,.01, partial g2=.199 and ritual involvement on physiological responses overall, which were qualified by the time by involvement interaction: 
ritual involvement was significant for the fire-walk, but there was no difference for the baseline responses,

The standardized heart rates of the fire-walkers during the fire-walk were significantly higher than that of low-ordeal participants and spectators. 
For most fire-walkers, the period of the fire-walk (although the actual fire-walk only lasted a few seconds for each individual) led to much higher heart rate reactivity than the preceding hours of physical activity during the procession and the preparation of the ritual. Spectators and low-ordeal participants did not differ from each other. This only partially confirms our hypothesis 2.
The only gender effect was a significant time6gender interac-
tion for happiness: , with males reporting marginally greater happiness after the ritual than before the ritual

One potential problem with any naturally occurring study like ours is self-selection of participants into the high-ordeal group. We asked all participants how often they have fire-walked before (M=2.7, range=0–15) and how often they had watched fire- walks previously (M=6.9, range=0–35).

Discussion:

two potential mechanisms: release of opioids, and pain-offset effects:

- pain-offset mechanism would predict that individuals who engage more frequently in negatively valenced activities will become habituated to the negative states, but will report an increased reversal of the negative state after the end of the activity
- To the extent that increased participation in these extreme rituals (i.e. repeated fire-walks) will lead to habituation that increases the positive effects on participants, we should see greater pain tolerance during the fire-walk and increased positive affective reaction after the ritual (asymmetrical reverse) [25]
- the endogenous release of opioids mechanism suggests that opioids are released with greater efficiency after repeated exposure

Self-selection and habituation:
It is possible that these annual events may not be sufficient for showing habituation effects, at least with the type of measures that we were able to apply in this field setting. Future studies obtaining self- reports during, as well as before and after events that vary in frequency would be most helpful for a better understanding of the unfolding of affective reactions during extreme ritual. 

Fatigue: 
low-ordeal participants did not experience an emotional high after participating in the central part of the ritual (e.g., via release of endogenous opioids)
related participants have family ties to the fire-walkers, they may have subjectively experienced suffering through empathic identification processes [8,9].

Emotional high and eudaimonia:
emotional highs may be plausible, especially if the experience is framed in religious terms highlighting the transformative nature of the ritual for all participants and observers (e.g., suffering increasing the blessing for the community; perceived suffering emphasizes the power of religion to transcend worldly ordeal).


Bastian et al. [31] experimentally demonstrated that individuals who recalled an episode in which they had committed some unethical behavior were more likely to induce pain to themselves compared to people who did not recall such memories. The pain was rated as more intense in the moral digression condition compared to the control condition. this experience of pain reduced the experimentally induced guilt compared to a condition where people were not given the option of hurting themselves.

Future research: 
Translating these findings to field settings, are individuals who believe that they have transgressed some moral boundaries (committed some sin or are impure in respect to some subjectively or communally salient moral standard) more likely to engage in extreme rituals compared to other individuals? Or in sport, does the sensee of interdependence tranlaste to willingness for sacrifice? 

Do people who believe that they have transgressed some moral boundaries (committed a sin or have become impure) experience greater pain during the ritual and consequently experience a greater off-set of pain and more positive affect

speculate that the perception of moral transgressions increases the perceived pain among high-ordeal participants in extreme rituals
This perception of pain then leads to a) more prosocial behavior targeted towards the community and b) greater positive affect following the ritual for the individual.

The perceived violation of moral standards reinforces the importance of the ritual both for individuals (by providing opportunities for moral cleansing) and the community (by increasing social cooperation and reifying moral standards)..},

annote = {bonding rooted in kinship but could be extended
to tribes and nations through the sharing of ritual and ideology,

A particularly influential idea was that it is the social function of rituals to rejuvenate commitment to collective goals and to ensure acquiescence to the will of the group and deference to figures of authority (Kertzer 1988)

do not furnish us with many precise and testable hypotheses concerning the mechanisms allegedly connecting ritual participation with particular forms and intensities of group cohesion and co- operation, and for decades there was no systematic effort to formulate and test hypotheses of this kind.

Effects of synchronized movement (a common feature in collective rituals), costly signaling (rit- uals often incur heavy costs in terms of material resources, time, and physical effort or suffering), and displays of com- mitment to particular belief systems (such as religious traditions).

Efforts to investigate the effects of synchrony on in-group affiliation and commitment to communal goals have focused on such behaviors as synchronous marching (Wil- termuth and Heath 2009), rowing (Cohen et al. 2006), andmusical performance (Tomasello 1999)


Theories of costly signaling, but can we hone in on the psychological mehcnanisms at play here? 
A potentially complementary line of research considers the possibility that rit- uals inspire trust and cooperation by signaling commitment to the group (Irons 2001; Sosis 2006). A somewhat similar proposal is that rituals affect our cognitive tendency to believe the pronouncements of others to the extent that they practice what they preach. On this view, rituals serve as “credibility enhancing displays” for the group ideologies underlying them (Henrich 2009; Lanman 2012).

the need for and benefits of fractionating (Boyer and Bergstrom 2008) the folk category “ritual” into distinct, empirically tractable phenomena with particular effects on cohesion and cooperation.

this work has not applied the same rigorous procedures to the category of “co- hesion” and has not yet become grounded in a more encom- passing theory of the relationship between ritual, cohesion, and cooperation

Why should we regard ritual as a signal of trustworthiness or conviction when we also know that there are strong social pressures driving participation and often sanctions for failure to participate in the proper fashion?

“ritual” is a folk category dragging along with it the baggage of a peculiarly Western history (Asad 2007; Bell 1992). Under this folk category, however, are numerous cognitively and behaviorally universal patterns that are normally associated with the term “ritual,” including such phenomena as synchronic movement, causally opaque action, and both euphoric and dysphoric arousal

While existing cognitive and evolutionary work on ritual and cooperation discusses the effects of synchrony, signaling, and arousal, it has only recently begun to examine one of the most central components of what has traditionally been called “ritual”: causal opacity (Herrmann et al. 2013; Legare et al., forthcoming; Nielbo and Sorensen 2011;Watson-Jones et al., forthcoming; Whitehouse 2011, 2012)

Since rituals are not tightly constrained by ordinary causal reasoning, they can assume a potentially infinite range of forms and involve numerous dis- tinct processes, such as aforementioned elements of synchrony (Hove and Risen 2009; Bulbulia and Sosis; 2011; Fischer et al. 2013; Reddish et al. 2013) and emotional arousal (Kon- valinka et al. 2011; Xygalatas et al. 2013b). Given this diversity, rituals can also serve as admirable group markers (Henrich and Henrich 2007; Richerson and Boyd 2005).

Cohesion:
The term“social cohesion” suggests that people can become attached to each other so as to think and act as a group. But the metaphor of social cohesion, however intuitively appeal- ing, is somewhat vague.

Durkheim (1995 [1912]) famously at- tempted to characterize two broadly contrasting forms of so- cial cohesion, which he labeled “mechanical” and “organic” solidarity.

Small groups: "mechanical solidarity", psychollogically bound by a “conscience collectif” reproduced and strengthened through the performance of collective rituals

“organic solidarity,” which prevails in much larger societies divided into specialized organs rather than func- tionally equivalent segments, united by mutual interdepen- dence in an elaborated division of labor, rather than by likeness.

We argue that these issues of testability and conflation in much social theory can be addressed by employing a distinction in con- temporary social psychology between two forms of cohesion: identity fusion and group identification

the effects of fusion and identification have been extensively documented experimentally, and different modes of ritual practice can be shown to produce these distinct bonds.

Identity fusion occurs when a social identity becomes an essential component of our personal self-concept (Swann et al. 2012)

Identity fusion has a number of downstream be- havioral outcomes. For instance, when another group member is threatened, it prompts the same defensive reactions as a personal attack or an attack on one's kin (Buhrmester et al., forthcoming; Swann et al. 2010a)

Further, since social identities are essential parts of fused individuals' personal self- concepts, physiological arousal of the individual translates into pro-group action (Swann et al. 2009).

And perhaps most importantly, fused individuals demonstrate a significant will- ingness to sacrifice themselves for their groups (Swann et al. 2010b).

group identification:
Rather than a feeling of shared essence with the group, identified individuals merely feel that they share certain prototypical features with other group members that are not es- sential to their individual, personal identities (Go´mez et al. 2011).

We all have a sense of personal identity, in the form of unique personal histories and personality traits that define us as distinct from other people, but we also all have social identities, as members of groups that make us similar to oth- ers.

For people who are identified but not fused with the group, external threats to the community are not seen as threats to one's family, and physiological arousal does not produce pro-group action (Swann et al. 2009).

increased levels of group identification fail to predict extreme self-sacrifice in Trolley Dilemmas (Go´mez et al. 2011; Swann et al. 2010b) and offer less power for predicting individuals' expressed willingness to fight, sacrifice, and die for one's social group (Swann et al. 2012). These findings regarding the dif- ferent nature and effects of fusion and identification suggest that they are quite distinct phenomena and that, as we argue below, the mechanisms underlying them may well have dif- ferent evolutionary histories.

Psychological Kinship and Fusion
Psychological processes underlying Fusion:
(1) the construction of self-concepts through episodic memory, (2) kin detection through phenotypic matching.

Consequently, for a fused individual, group members are not perceived as mere coop- erators; they are psychological kin

inclusive fitness theory, which shows that self- sacrifice can evolve under natural selection if it produces an increase in the frequency of the altruist's genes

Since the genetic makeup of individuals cannot be ob- served directly without sophisticated scientific apparatus, evolved solutions to this problem are likely to involve cues that reliably correlate with genetic relatedness (Park et al. 2008; Penn and Frommen 2010).

In the case of humans and many other species, perceptions
of phenotypic similarity, along with familiarity, serve as kin recognition heuristics and play an important role in governing altruistic behavior.

Humans, however, may not be limited to physiological cues; perhaps uniquely, humans also appear to use shared mental attributes, such as certain attitudes, to detect and favor genetic relatives (Park and Schaller 2005).

Not all mental attributes, however, are created equal in their
ability to distinguish close genetic kin. An innate tendency to perform more costly altruistic acts toward individuals who are mentally similar to you without discriminating between domains of similarity carries a great risk of exploitation

Humans, as a result of our evolved ethnic psychology (Henrich and Henrich 2007), are very adept at imitating the body dec- orations and fashions of others and learning the beliefs and behavioral conventions of those around them

Any kin-detection system that relied on perceiving shared beliefs and values could easily end up mistaking all group members for genetic relatives.

We argue that while perceiving shared social norms, which
are acquired through instruction and stored in semantic memory, will result in intuitions of shared groupmembership and trustworthiness via the workings of ethnic psychology (Henrich and Henrich 2007; Richerson and Boyd 2005); it will not trigger kin recognition and the resulting state of “psy- chological kinship” (Bailey and Nava 1989; Park et al. 2008).

What will trigger psychological kinship is the perception that one shares with others episodic memories that are essential components of one's autobiographical self-concept (Boyer 2009; Bruner 1990; Conway 1996; Damasio 2010; McAdams 2008) since sharing such essential, self-defining experiences serves as a fairly reliable marker of genetic relatedness.

Episodic memory: construction of a person's autobiographical knowledge and highly valued narrative self-concept, the sense of “who they are” (Bloch 2012; Conway 1996; Damasio 2010; Dennett 1992)

Further, evidence suggests that human beings view some elements of these narratives as more essential than oth- ers (Singer and Salovey 1993; Wilson and Ross 2003)

essential components of one's autobiographical self, resulting from significant life events stored in episodic memory and ranging from the formative experiences of childhood to shar- ing the traumas of front-line warfare, can be perceived as shared with others in a group

with our enhanced episodic memory and narrative selves, the “self” template used in phenotypic matching may involve not only cues of facial resemblance and similar major histocompatibility complexes (Villenger and Waldman 2012) but also cues of shared experience and personal essence. The perception that one shares with another important, self-de- fining experience encoded in episodic memory, we argue, pro- duces a powerful sense of psychological kinship.

Dysphoric experiences: one of the fractionated elements of the folk category "ritual" ?

a significant body of evidence suggests that highly dysphoric experiences, one of the fractionated elements of the category “ritual,” are especially powerful (Conway 1995). Recent research suggests that highly dysphoric experiences, such as front-line combat (Whitehouse and McQuinn 2013) and “rites of terror” (Whitehouse 1996), work to rewrite individual self-concepts and produce psychological kinship among those undergoing such experiences together.

Evidence for Dysphoric Arousal:
For example, in a survey of fighters in the 2011 revolution in Libya, we found that degree of shared dysphoria in battle predicted strength of fusion with brigade (Whitehouse 2012); Matthews et al. (forthcoming) found that veterans of the Vietnam War who witnessed comrades being killed or wounded became more fused with the identity “Viet- nam veterans” but not more identified; in a recent survey of over 450 Spaniards, Go´mez et al. (forthcoming) found that thinking about shared dysphoric experiences with other Span- iards predicted greater willingness to fight and die for Spain.

Use of lnaguage of kinship to describe fusion:
Moreover, people spontaneously describe fusion using the language of kinship and familial relatedness. Buhrmester and colleagues (forthcoming) found that fused Americans were much more likely to offer help to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing victims and to report a willingness to sacrifice their lives to ensure that the bombers would be caught—and cru- cially that this effect of identity fusion on altruism was fully mediated by feelings of psychological kinship with all Amer- icans (as evidenced by support for such statements as: “mem- bers of my country are like family to me” and “if someone in my country is hurt or in danger, it is like a family member is hurt or in danger”)

McKay et al. (forthcoming) have found preliminary evidence that, when individuals who are fused with a national identity think explicitly about that identity, they find sexual words less accessible than those who are not fused with that national identity, suggesting that the psychological kinship produced by fusion affects both altru- ism and incest avoidance.

Our research suggests that perceiving these essential elements in other people triggers the phenotypic matching process resulting in psychological kinship

fusion may have evolved as part of our kin psychology to promote altruism among small bands of genetic relatives, group identification seems to have emerged as a bonding mechanism for larger assemblages of more distantly related individuals alongside other “tribal social instincts” (Richerson and Boyd 2005) designed to allow the individual to reap the benefits of group living.

Group Identification:
group identification involves categorical rather than relational ties with others (Brewer and Gardner 1996); 
when one is identified with a group, one is not relating to other members as unique in- dividual persons, but simply as anonymous members of the same social category who share the prototypical beliefs, prac- tices, and values of the group (Tajfel and Turner 1979). 
This anonymity is demonstrated in studies using the minimal group paradigm, in which participants become biased in favor of in-groups defined by trivial criteria and containing indi- viduals whom they have never previously encountered (e.g., Billig and Tajfel 1973).

While humans could rely on kin altruism (Hamilton 1964) and reciprocity (Trivers 1971) to reap the benefits of cooperation in small, face-to-face social groups, 
- new psychological adaptations were required to benefit from cooperation and accumulated cultural knowledge in larger communities defined by symbolic identity markers (Henrich and Henrich 2007; Richerson and Boyd 2005)

One possibility is that through the process of gene-culture coevolution, hu- man beings evolved biases to preferentially learn and commit to beliefs, behaviors, and values from prestigious individuals (Henrich and Gil-White 2001), from the majority of members in their groups (Boyd and Richerson 1985), and from those individuals who demonstrate commitment to these social norms through their actions (Henrich 2009).

mathematical models and cross-cultural experimental studies suggest that humans evolved further biases to preferentially cooperate with individuals sharing these prototypical group norms (Richerson and Henrich 2012), to punish altruistic group members violating these norms (Bowles and Gintis 2011; Gintis 2000), and to commit more strongly to these norms in the face of threat (Navarrete et al. 2004; Sosis 2007)

the coalitionary psychological roots of group identification are clearly apparent in minimal group paradigm studies in which participants actually favor out-groups (Rabbie, Schot, and Visser 1989) or demonstrate fairness across groups (Karp et al. 1993) when their task payoffs come from other sources besides the in-group (Kurzban and Neuberg 2005). In these studies, shared identity is meaningless without the collective benefits such identities are designed to provide

Group identification can be amplified by perceptions of
threat and uncertainty (Greenberg et al. 1990; Kay et al. 2008; Navarrete et al. 2004) and, we predict, by witnessing others displaying strong commitment to the prototypical norms of the group (Henrich 2009)

evidence suggests group identification is relatively weak in producing the extreme pro-group behaviors we see in war, suicide terrorism, and other forms of costly altruism (Swann et al. 2010b).

Without the power of fusion and psy- chological kinship, group identification produces committed citizens but not extreme self-sacrific

How does ritual produce social cohe- sion?” misguided. Rather, beneath these commonly used terms are a diverse set of phenomena including causally opaque conventions, synchrony, dysphoric and euphoric arousal, identity fusion, and group identification.

With the precision provided by this process of fractionation, we can take a fresh look at the question of ritual's impact on group cohesion, considering how the different elements of “ritual” affect fusion and identification

Scrutiny of the ethnographic and historical record suggests that collective rituals come in two main packages of ritual elements, with one package working to produce fusion and the other to produce identification.

Viewed within an evolutionary frame- work, different societies require higher or lower levels of fu- sion or identification to fulfill their basic material and eco- nomic needs in diverse resource environments (Whitehouse and Hodder 2010; Whitehouse and McQuinn 2013), and the two ritual packages evolve, through a process of cultural group selection, to produce the required levels of fusion or identi- fication (Turchin et al. 2012)


“imagistic practices” (Whitehouse 1995),
Involves a com- bination of causally opaque conventional actions and high levels of dysphoric arousal. These features work together to produce fusion among participants, binding them together as psychological kin and preparing them to participate in high- risk activities such as hunting dangerous animals and going to war

"doctrinal practices" (Whitehouse 1995), involves frequently repeated causally opaque conventional actions with low levels of dysphoric arousal but heavily emphasizing credibility-enhancing dis- plays for beliefs, ideologies, and values. This package works to produce at least baseline levels of group identification and thus sufficient trust to cooperate with strangers or relative strangers in ways required by centralized and often expan- sionary systems of governance, trade, and agriculture

Ritual, Shared Dysphoria, and Fusion

Some rituals involve such extreme forms of torture that it would not be an exaggeration to describe them as “rites of terror” (Whitehouse 1996)

Rites of terror abound in small- scale traditional societies engaged in raiding and warfare but also in modern armies and rebel groups. The kinds of ordeals inflicted on participants in such rituals are no less traumatic than those associated with medieval torture or the world's most repressive dictatorships. In Melanesian initiation cults, for example, boys undergoing initiation rites may be exten- sively burned, permanently scarred and mutilated, dehy- drated, beaten, and have objects inserted in sensitive areas such as the nasal septum, the base of the spine, the tongue, and the penis

One of the most striking limitations of these anthropological theories, however, is that although they might seem to capture some common under- lying patterns in the symbolism of rites of terror, they fail to explain why these kinds of practices are actually so painful and potentially harmful (Whitehouse 1996).

To accomplish the desired effects symbolically should require only that par- ticipants act out the narrative of separation and reincorporation as a sort of victory for society but not that people should actually be wounded, maimed, or even killed. The costs of participation seem to be out of all proportion to the imputed symbolic value.

psychologists and evolutionary scientists have attempted to tackle the costly nature of rites of terror head- on, with Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance explaining why paying a more severe cost for joining a group should produce increased “liking” of that group and its members (Aronson and Mills 1959; Festinger 1957) and the theory of costly signaling (e.g., Bulbulia 2004; Sosis 2003), suggesting that participation in such costly acts should serve as a reliable signal of group commitment and allow group members to trust one another enough to cooperate.

Although these theories directly address the puzzle of ritual dysphoria, they all assume that participation is voluntary. If participants in initiation rituals freely chose to undergo acute traumas in order to join the group, this might indeed lead them to conclude that group membership is worth the price

And yet in all or most of the initiation rituals described by anthropologists, participation is coerced (Cimino 2011). If the penalties for flinching or running away are certain death, the prospects of suffering but surviving the ritual ordeal are comparatively attractive (Whitehouse 2004).},

abstract = {Maintenance of fluid homeostasis during periods of heightened physical stress can be best evaluated in humans using exercise as a model. Although it is well established that arginine vasopressin (AVP), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are the principle hormones regulating fluid balance at rest, the potential contributions of other related endocrine factors, such as oxytocin (OT) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), have not been well described during exercise. Seven endurance-trained runners completed three separate running trials: a maximal test to exhaustion (high intensity), a 60-min treadmill run (steady state), and a 56 km ultramarathon (prolonged endurance exercise). Statistically significant pre- to post-run increases were found only following the ultramarathon in [AVP](p) (1.9 vs 6.7 pg/ml; P{\textless}0.05), [OT](p) (1.5 vs 3.5 pg/ml; P{\textless}0.05), [NT-proBNP](p) (23.6 vs 117.9 pg/ml; P{\textless}0.01), [interleukin 6](p) (4.0 vs 59.6 pg/ml; P{\textless}0.05), [cortisol](p) (14.6 vs 32.6 microg/ml; P{\textless}0.01), [corticosterone](p) (652.8 vs 3491.4 ng/ml; P{\textless}0.05) and [11-deoxycortisol](p) (0.1 vs 0.5 microg/ml; P{\textless}0.05) while a significant post-run increase in [aldosterone](p) was documented after high-intensity (4.9 vs 12.5 ng/ml; P{\textless}0.05), steady-state (6.1 vs 16.9 ng/ml; P{\textless}0.05) and prolonged endurance running (2.6 vs 19.7 ng/ml; P{\textless}0.05). Similarly, changes in fluid balance parameters were significantly different between the ultramarathon versus high-intensity and steady-state running with regard to plasma volume contraction (less {\%} contraction), body weight loss (increased {\%} weight loss), plasma [Na(+)] Delta (decreased from baseline), and urine osmolality Delta (increase from baseline). Hypothetically driven relationships between [OT](p) and [AVP](p) (r=0.69; P{\textless}0.01) and between [NT-proBNP](p) Delta and plasma [Na(+)] Delta (r=-0.79; P{\textless}0.001)--combined with the significant and unexpected pre- to post-race increases after prolonged endurance exercise--allows for possible speculation that OT and BNP may assist their better known companion hormones (AVP and ANP) in the regulation of fluid balance during conditions of extreme physical stress.},

abstract = {Ritual behaviors of some form exist in every society known to anthropologists. Despite this universality, we have little understanding of how ritual behavior varies within populations or across the lifespan, nor the determinants of this variation. Here we test hypotheses derived from life history theory by using behavioral observations and oral interview data concerning participant variation in Fijian kava-drinking ceremonies. We predicted that substantial variation in the frequency and duration of participation would result from (1) trade-offs with reproduction and (2) the intrinsic status differences between ritual participants. We demonstrate that when controlling for household composition, men with young offspring participated less frequently and exhibited greater variance in their time spent at ceremonies than men without young children. However, men with a larger number of total dependents in their household participated more frequently than those with fewer. Moreover, we found that men's ascribed rank, level of education, and reliance on wage labor all significantly predict their frequency of attendance. We also found that the number of dependents a man has in his household is positively correlated with total food production, and the amount of kava he cultivates. In general, these results suggest that ritual participation is part of an important strategy employed by Fijian men for both achieving status and developing social alliances. Variation in participation in kava ceremonies by Fijian men therefore reflects the constraints of their current life history condition and their inherited rank.},

abstract = {Collective rituals are biologically ancient and culturally pervasive, yet few studies have quantified their effects on participants. We assessed two plausible models from qualitative anthropology: ritual empathy predicts affective convergence among all ritual participants irrespective of ritual role; rite-of-passage predicts emotional differences, specifically that ritual initiates will express relatively negative valence when compared with non-initiates. To evaluate model predictions, images of participants in a Spanish fire-walking ritual were extracted from video footage and assessed by nine Spanish raters for arousal and valence. Consistent with rite-of-passage predictions, we found that arousal jointly increased for all participants but that valence differed by ritual role: fire-walkers exhibited increasingly positive arousal and increasingly negative valence when compared with passengers. This result offers the first quantified evidence for rite of passage dynamics within a highly arousing collective ritual. Methodologically, we show that surprisingly simple and non-invasive data structures (rated video images) may be combined with methods from evolutionary ecology (Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Effects models) to clarify poorly understood dimensions of the human condition.},

This paper examines the proximate and ultimate motivations of hunting behaviour from a neuroendocrine perspective, using salivary testosterone and cortisol data collected before, during and after hunting focal follows from 31 Tsimane hunters aged 18-82 years. Despite circadian declines in hormone levels, testosterone and cortisol of Tsimane hunters increased at the time of a kill, and remained high as successful hunters returned home. Previous studies of hormonal changes during competitions find that high-stakes and success in the presence of relevant audiences result in increased neuroendocrine arousal. If men hunt primarily to provision their families, then an additional audience would not be expected to impact testosterone or cortisol, nor would the size of the animal killed. However, if signalling male quality by 'showing off' was a larger relative driver of men's hunting behaviour, one would expect greater hormonal response in cases where men returned with large sharable kills, especially in the presence of community members. Consistent with provisioning models of male hunting motivation, neither kill size nor encountering an audience of villagers while returning from hunting was associated with hormonal changes for successful hunters.},

In other words, elders and ritual experts reproduce rituals because they are deeply convinced that they must preserve the knowledge and insight gained by performing the ritual

In the first experiment, we found that participants with stronger emotional reactions to the ritual demonstrated greater volume and depth of reflection on the meaning of the ritual two months later. Furthermore, in the second experiment, we found that partici- pants with stronger emotional reactions to the ritual demonstrated a greater increase in volume and depth of reflection on the ritual over a one-month time period


1. ritual actions differ from nonritual actions by virtue of being irreducible to means-end technical motivations or to the intentional states of the actor

ritual actors are not the authors of their actions in any usual sense

Rituals are constructed out of clusters of actions that are stipulated in advance, rather than expressing the intentionalities of those who carry them out.

It is not intuitively obvious why the particular stipulations take the form that they do, rather than some other form. Who was it who first came up with these rules for performing the ritual, and (even more puzzlingly) why?
Is this the same in exercise? There is something deeply intuitive and exciting about seeing the body in motion

Whitehouse on ritual Frequency:
the lower the frequency of a ritual, the more arousing it is likely to be, because if it were not arousing it would fail to elicit the right kinds of memories and motiva- tions and would either die out or come to be more frequently performed

low-frequency, high-arousal rituals give rise to enduring episodic memories

Whitehouse has started to focus his attention instead on the consequences of episodic recall for the way people think about the mean- ings of high-arousal rituals (e.g., Whitehouse 2002a, 2002b, 2002c).

a major effect of vivid, enduring episodic mem- ory for rituals is that it encourages long-term rumination on what it all means.

What preoccupies participants in high- arousal rituals is the question of why the originator of the rituals insisted on certain prescriptions and proscriptions with regard to conduct, demeanor, dress, speech, and so on, as opposed to all the other possible ways of doing the ritual that could easily be imagined

Whitehouse argues that it may be quite easy to remember ritual procedures (what you must and mustn't do), but people have great difficulty remembering the official meanings of the acts unless these meanings are frequently repeated

In the case of high-frequency rituals, there are many opportunities to rehearse official exegesis, and this fact (com- bined with low rates of spontaneous reflection on the matter) explains why standardized authoritative exegesis is mainly found in routinized religious tra- ditions

In the case of rarely performed rituals, exegesis is based not on ver- bal testimony but on independent reflection. What typically drives this reflection is episodic memory for intrinsically puzzling actions, that is to say, for ritual actions.

elaborate ritual exegesis generated in this way takes on the character of a body of revelations—that is, of ini- tially surprising insights into esoteric mysteries that, over time, develop great motivational force

What drives the elders and ritual experts to reproduce the tradition is their deeply held conviction that the knowledge they have gained is valuable and necessary to preserve

Boyer: argues that ritual ordeals may well “focus the mind,” in the sense of causing people to pay attention to what is happening during the rituals...what evidence is there, he asks, that these experiences give rise to revelatory religious knowledge based on personal rumination about the meanings of the rituals?

Many social and cultural anthropologists have tried to show that participants in rare, traumatic rituals (such as violent initiation rites) gradually develop elaborate esoteric insights into their meaning, culminating in cosmological expertise on the part of cult leaders (see Whitehouse and Laidlaw 2004) - - - The "spirit" falacy... how leadership makes meaning on behalf of the group..


Ritual participants may be very reluctant to talk or write about their private ru- minations on matters of ritual exegesis, particularly in traditions that regard rituals and their meanings as secret. If mystery cults are founded on personal revelations rather than publicly transmitted teachings, as Whitehouse main- tains, then how are we to access those “private moments” of reflection?

analogical thinking - one psychological mechansims involved...
“the process of understanding a novel situation in terms of one that is already familiar” (Gentner and Holyoak 1997, 32),

distinction between source and target analogs:
Analogies postulate links between a particular object, event, or state of affairs (the “target” analog) and some previously independent object, event, or state of affairs (the “source” analog)

source analogs consist of familiar situations and target analogs consist of novel ones

(Some instances of analogical thinking are based on the recognition of connections between two situations that are both novel or that are both familiar)

what is characteristic of spontaneous analogical thinking is that the connections it proposes are novel, insofar as the person is drawing parallels that he or she has not recognized before (even if others have already done so at least partly by independent means)

Research suggests that the production of analogies is a natural cognitive process and seems to be used often to impart information that is less easily conveyed in other ways

analogical reasoning plays a significant role ritual participants' attempts to make sense of their experi- ences, at least in highly arousing rituals. Whitehouse refers to this process as “spontaneous exegetical reflection” 

Holyoak and Thagard's (1997) multiconstraint theory, there are three general constraints that guide the selection of analogical comparisons:
similarity: guided by perceptual commonalities between the source and target; a spider web and a fishing net. "superficial” analogies, in the sense that they have common outward appearances or visceral connotations rather than because they are formally or functionally similar

"Deep analogies" capture form and purpose:
Deep analogies capitalize on parallels in the relational structure of elements in the source and target domains (Gentner 1983; Gentner and Mark- man 1997; Holyoak and Thagard 1997).

the most meaningful and informative (“deep”) analogies are those in which the source and target analogs share connected systems of relations, resulting in more elaborate parallels

A spider web and a fishing net may have superficial (perceptual) similarities, but deeper connections might be made between their trapping functions, allowing further analogical connections between spiders and fisherman, or be- tween flies and fish, air and sea, and so on

structure:
purpose: 


But since ritual behavior is not functional in the same way as spi- ders' webs and fishing nets (i.e., is not reducible to technical motivations), deep analogical thinking in relation to problems of ritual meaning cannot be triggered by a simple surface analog, taken in isolation

In puzzling over the question of what a particular ritual action means, we have to look for intentionality not in the functional properties of the action but in its place in a wider nexus of ritualized behaviors

Blanchette and Dunbar (2001) have studied the use of analogy in natural settings. In one study, they explored the types of source analogs people will choose in political debates, by extracting and coding po- litical analogies from several newspapers (Blanchette and Dunbar 2001). The analogies were coded for the source category (the source of the analogy, which is then mapped onto the current situation, or target), the range (within-domain vs. other-domain), the goal of the analogy creator, and the emotional connotation. 

They found significant differences in the types of newspaper articles that contained analogies. In general, they found that analogies were most often used in opinion articles rather than articles meant to impart information. The large majority of the analogies (77 percent) were from domains other than politics, and these analogies tended to be more strongly emotionally charged than analogies that remained within the domain of politics. Furthermore, the large majority of analogies that were employed to support a given position had a positive emotional connotation, and analogies used to oppose a position had a negative emotional connotation.

Results suggest that: analogies offer more than just factual information on a topic and seem to be well suited to the communication of emotionally colored meanings

Whitehouse (2004) hypothesizes that ritual actions constitute a domain of activity in which the potential for the formation of deep analogical connections is considerable; the extent to which this potential is realized, however, depends on whether the ritual procedures become a focus of conscious rumination

The tendency for ritual procedures to spark conscious rumination is likely enhanced in high-arousal rituals by the prominence and diversity of what McCauley and Lawson call “sensory pageantry” (2002)

levels of conscious rumination are also determined by the relative frequency and emotionality of rituals.

Frequently performed rituals give rise to implicit procedural fluency but low rates of explicit reflection

More rarely performed ritual actions, especially if they are arousing and per- sonally consequential, are likely to be remembered consciously as unique episodes in one's life experience. problems of exegetical meaning cannot be so easily ignored and intermittently thrust themselves upon consciousness like a nagging puzzle that refuses to be solved

Participants in high-arousal rituals generally believe that the mysteries confronting them originate in powerful otherworldly agents, and that the consequences of misunderstanding the rituals are dire. So the motivation to gain some sort of mastery over problems of ritual exegesis, however provisional and speculative, is much greater than that which drives us to tinker with crossword puzzles...

we predict that levels of arousal during ritual performances will correlate directly with volume and structural depth in exegetical thinking

Measuring SER:
- possible in principle to de- termine what proportions of the actions are accorded exegetical meanings based on verbal testimony as opposed to independent inference, assuming one can determine exactly what participants are told about the ritual and that they are willing to report their conscious interpretations of it.

- We could measure the structural depth of SER by scoring exegetical commentaries ac- cording to whether or not they contain analogiesWe could measure the structural depth of SER by scoring exegetical commentaries ac- cording to whether or not they contain analogies

Depth could of course be defined in a number of ways: 
- within-domain (e.g., one part of a ritual is analogous to another part of it) versus
- cross-domain (e.g., one part of a ritual is analogous to some process, object, or event in a nonritual setting), 
- concrete (e.g., ritual procedures that resemble other kinds of procedures) versus 
- abstract (e.g., ritual cohesion resembles rela- tions based on kinship)


two experiments designed to test whether participants who have a strong emotional reaction to a ritual demonstrate greater volume and depth of spontaneous exegetical reflection than participants experiencing lower levels of arousal

Experiment 1:
Arousal high/low:
high arousal was performed at dusk and portions of ritual using a blindfold. Otherwise identical

--is this enough to create higher emotional arousal?
Also what about the emotional componenet of anticipation that leads up to the ritual? surely this wasn't present it the experiment?


Participants were asked to recall freely the events of the evening or afternoon that they participated in the interview. They were also asked to indicate what thoughts crossed their mind while performing the ritual and if any aspect of the ritual struck them as especially significant or important. If participants did not expand on the possible meanings of a ritual action, the interviewer questioned them directly on whether that action seemed impor- tant and for what reason.

Results: 
- high-arousal ritual condition reported a significantly greater intensity of fright (M ? 1.83, SD ? 1.90) than participants in the low-arousal ritual con- dition (M ? .45, SD ? .82; t[21] ? 2.22, p ? .05). There was also a trend to- ward significance in reported levels of relaxation. Participants in the high- arousal ritual condition (M ? 1.50, SD ? 1.57) reported lower levels of relaxation than participants in the low-arousal ritual condition (M?2.73, SD ? 1.56; t[21] ? 1.88, p ? .07).

-- post-hoc split between high arousal group and low arousal group:

participants in the high-arousal group (M ? 11.25, SD ? 8.44) on average attrib- uted meanings to a significantly greater number of actions than did partici- pants in the low-arousal group (M ? 6.27, SD ? 3.61; t[21] ? 1.81, p ? .05)

significant difference in the cumulative SER interview scores (t[21] ? 1.69, p ? .05). The mean score for the high-arousal group (M ? 18.92, SD ? 15.07) was significantly higher than the mean score for the low-arousal group (M ? 10.45, SD ? 2.02).

Experiment 2: 
correct for some of the problems in the first experiment, more specifically group sizes, measurement of arousal level, and interviewing techniques.
To correct for uncertainties about arousal level, we used extreme sound and lighting differences at Queens' Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC) to vary arousal level, 
and we assessed participants actual emotional arousal levels while performing the ritual through a galvanic skin response (GSR) measure that could then be compared to their subjective reports of emotion.

post-hoc organisation of participants into high and low arousal, regardless of ritual condition.


our rituals lacked any sense of personal conse- quentiality, given that the rituals were not “real” rituals and that the social cir- cumstances for participants were quite different from those we would expect in more natural settings - this actually runs against the hypothesis

fact that we found significant differences based on emotional arousal even in the absence of personal consequentiality is quite suggestive.},

DS principles stipulate higher-order wholes emerging from lower-order constituents through bidirectional causal processes--offering a common language for psychological and neurobiological models. After identifying some limitations of mainstream emotion theory, I apply DS principles to emotion-cognition relations. I then present a psychological model based on this reconceptualization, identifying trigger, self-amplification, and self-stabilization phases of emotion-appraisal states, leading to consolidating traits. The article goes on to describe neural structures and functions involved in appraisal and emotion, as well as DS mechanisms of integration by which they interact. These mechanisms include nested feedback interactions, global effects of neuromodulation, vertical integration, action-monitoring, and synaptic plasticity, and they are modeled in terms of both functional integration and temporal synchronization. I end by elaborating the psychological model of emotion-appraisal states with reference to neural processes.},

While critics were scandalized by the permissiveness of these contests, aficionados were stunned by the effectiveness of relatively non-violent fighting techniques. The matches revealed how resilient a trained fighter's body might become. Fighters had to adapt to several waves of changes in fighting strategies and to strategic revisions of match regulations intended to make them more obviously violent. Seemingly minor changes in the tools available to contestants - mundane technology' such as the structure of the fighting space, standardized clothing and lightweight gloves - shifted radically how contestants' bodies could be used. In addition, fighters modified their own bodies to make them better suited for the activity, for example, altering perceptions of pain. Ironically, the mass-mediated presentation of deregulated fighting revealed that, instead of being humanity's natural state, it was technically demanding, dependent upon substantial enculturation of athletes' bodies, and far from instinctual.},

Exercise groups were exposed to a swimming regime of 1 h a day, 5 days a week for 9 weeks. The passive avoidance test showed that middle-aged exercised rats had significantly (P{\textless}0.05) better short- (24 h) and long-term (72 h) memory than aged-matched control rats. Conditioned pole-jumping avoidance learning was improved markedly in both age groups by exercise. Brain thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine content in the DNA did not change significantly, while the protein carbonyl levels decreased significantly (P{\textless}0.05) in both exercised groups. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in the chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasome complex in the exercised groups, whereas trypsin-like activity did not differ significantly between all groups. The DT-diaphorase activity increased significantly (P{\textless}0.05) in the brain of young exercised animals.

In three studies, children (aged 3-9, N = 124) viewed only within-category harm as violating intrinsic obligations; in contrast, they viewed between-category harm as violating extrinsic obligations defined by explicit rules. These data indicate that children view social categories as marking patterns of intrinsic interpersonal obligations, suggesting that a key function of social categories is to support inferences about how people will relate to members of their own and other groups.},

Several epidemiologic studies have attempted to address this issue by using widely varying definitions of physical activity as well as differing methods to assess cognitive function or dementia. Despite the variability in study design, longitudinal studies report that the risk of dementia, cognitive impairment, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease is lower among persons engaging in high levels of physical activity, relative to those engaging in low levels of physical activity. There is also evidence of a dose-response relationship between physical activity and preservation of cognitive function, even though small increases in physical activity from a sedentary state can reap comparatively large incremental benefits. Reductions in the relative risk of vascular dementia associated with physical activity were weaker and more variable. Although many studies had a follow-up duration of around 5 years, at least one study has found evidence that exercise in midlife reduces the risk of dementia in late life. How interactions between physical activity and the APOE e4 allele affect the risk of cognitive impairment is inconsistent. The available epidemiologic studies support the concept that physical activity might prevent or delay the onset of cognitive decline. Whether that effect will translate into a reduction in the prevalence of dementia is unknown. ?? 2007 The Alzheimer's Association.},

We review the literature documenting these structural changes and explore exactly where in the brain these changes occur as well as the underlying substrates of the changes including neural, glial, and vasculature components. Aerobic activity has been shown to produce different types of changes in the brain. The presence of novel experiences or learning is an especially important component in how these changes are manifest. We also discuss the distinct time courses of structural brain changes with both aerobic activity and learning as well as how these effects might differ in diseased and elderly groups.},

evolutionary repurposing involving oxytocin pathways (i.e., oxytocin, vasopressin, and their receptors [15]).

Humans and other primates routinely form non-reproductive bonded relationships of a type that are only observed between pair-bonded mates in other taxa [24]. Human social networks are particularly vast, stable, and complexly organized [14]. Our interac- tions with others are shaped both by our direct social ties with others and by relationships between third parties (e.g., our trust in others is intensified if they are friends with our friends [25]).

To successfully navigate our complex social world our brains must track and encode the psychological space between ourselves and others. A growing body of research suggests that representing distance from the self in social ties relies on mechanisms also involved in representing distance from the self in physical space [26,27], suggesting that phrases such as ‘close friend' and ‘distant relative' may be symptomatic of how the brain itself is organized (Box 1).

Social and temporal egocentric distances may have come to be encoded using mechanisms already involved in egocentric spatial distance encoding partly because the characteris- tics of aRTPJ connectivity and structure afford encoding information in self-centered coordinates [29], as well as switching between internally directed attention to empha- size decontextualized representations, and externally di- rected attention to emphasize current contextual details

Throughout primate evolution, PPC circuitry for encoding, tracking, and manipulating objects in the environment may have been repurposed to perform similar operations on objects and abstract concepts in working memory [7,8,31]

Second, because living in complexly bonded groups likely drove human brain evolution [24], many neuronal niches likely have pre-existing social functions. For example, reading co-opts circuitry for face and object recognition

It has also been suggested that cultural traditions that define non-kin in familial terms (e.g., fraternal orders) repurpose and reshape individuals' mental conceptions of natural relatedness [57]

Using brain systems that evolved for predicting the behavior of other people to make sense of our physical environment may shape how many cultural belief systems explain, and often anthropomor- phize, natural forces [63–65], Similarly, mechanisms involved in mentalizing may be co-opted to deal with large-scale, anonymous social structures (e.g., financial markets), with sometimes advantageous and sometimes deleterious consequences [66,67].},

abstract = {Learning a novel motor skill is associated with well characterized structural and functional plasticity in the rodent motor cortex. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies of visuomotor learning in humans have suggested that structural plasticity can occur in white matter (WM), but the biological basis for such changes is unclear. We assessed the influence of motor skill learning on WM structure within sensorimotor cortex using both diffusion MRI fractional anisotropy (FA) and quantitative immunohistochemistry. Seventy-two adult (male) rats were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (skilled reaching, unskilled reaching, and caged control). After 11 d of training, postmortem diffusion MRI revealed significantly higher FA in the skilled reaching group compared with the control groups, specifically in the WM subjacent to the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the trained limb. In addition, within the skilled reaching group, FA across widespread regions of WM in the contralateral hemisphere correlated significantly with learning rate. Immunohistological analysis conducted on a subset of 24 animals (eight per group) revealed significantly increased myelin staining in the WM underlying motor cortex in the hemisphere contralateral (but not ipsilateral) to the trained limb for the skilled learning group versus the control groups. Within the trained hemisphere (but not the untrained hemisphere), myelin staining density correlated significantly with learning rate. Our results suggest that learning a novel motor skill induces structural change in task-relevant WM pathways and that these changes may in part reflect learning-related increases in myelination.},

abstract = {Understanding the fundamental patterns and determinants of human cooperation and the maintenance of social order in human societies is a challenge across disciplines. The existing empirical evidence for the higher levels of cooperation when altruistic punishment is present versus when it is absent systematically ignores the institutional competition inherent in human societies. Whether punishment would be deliberately adopted and would similarly enhance cooperation when directly competing with nonpunishment institutions is highly controversial in light of recent findings on the detrimental effects of punishment. We show experimentally that a sanctioning institution is the undisputed winner in a competition with a sanction-free institution. Despite initial aversion, the entire population migrates successively to the sanctioning institution and strongly cooperates, whereas the sanction-free society becomes fully depopulated. The findings demonstrate the competitive advantage of sanctioning institutions and exemplify the emergence and manifestation of social order driven by institutional selection.},

Consistent with CST, torch fishing is observed by the predicted audience (women), energetically costly to perform, and a reliable indicator of the frequency a man fishes during the trade wind season. Contrary to expectations of who should benefit from torch fishing and consequently participate, torch fishers are not primarily young and unmarried. Torch fishers, however, are predominately from the matriline that owns the canoe on which they fish, suggesting that torch fishing also signals the productivity of a matriline. Although these results support the possibility that torch fishing is a handicap, no data are presented which demonstrate that torch fishers achieve any gains from sending the costly signal.

Predictions of a cognitive appraisal model and a communicative perspective on pain expression were compared. Participants (N = 67) received 5 electric pain stimuli administered by a confederate. They were led to believe that 5 pain stimuli were the minimum, a fixed amount, or the maximum number of pain stimuli allowed, thereby varying the social threat posed by the confederate. Reported pain and facial pain expression were recorded during the delivery of pain stimuli. Increased perceived social threat led to an increase of reported pain, specifically for high pain catastrophizing participants, while it led to a reduction of facial pain expression. This is the first study to demonstrate that a social threat manipulation has opposite effects on reported pain and facial expression, suggesting differences in adaptive function for both forms of pain expression. Perspective: This is the first demonstration showing an increase in verbal pain report and a decrease in nonverbal pain expression at the same time during social threat.

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect of acute aerobic exercise on self-reported positive-activated affect (PAA). Samples from 158 studies from 1979 to 2005 were included yielding 450 independent effect sizes (ESs) and a sample size of 13,101. Method: Studies were coded for moderators related to assessment time, exercise variables such as intensity, duration, and dose (combination of intensity and duration), and design characteristics. The analysis considered multiple measures of affect and corrected for statistical artifacts using Hunter and Schmidt [(1990). Methods of meta-analysis: Correcting error and bias in research findings. Newbury Park: Sage; (2004). Methods of meta-analysis: Correcting error and bias in research findings (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks: Sage] meta-analytic methods. Results: The overall estimated mean corrected ES (over(d, -)corr) and standard deviation (SDcorr) were .47 and .37, respectively. Effects were consistently positive (a) immediately post-exercise, (b) when pre-exercise PAA was lower than average, (c) for low intensity exercise {\textless}15-39{\%} oxygen uptake reserve ({\%}VO2R), (d) for durations up to 35 min, and (e) for low to moderate exercise doses. The effects of aerobic exercise on PAA appear to last for at least 30 min after exercise before returning to baseline. Dose results suggest the presence of distinct zones of affective change that more accurately reflect post-exercise PAA responses than intensity or duration alone. Control conditions were associated with reductions in PAA (over(d, -)corr = - . 17, SDcorr=.25). Conclusion: The typical acute bout of aerobic exercise produces increases in self-reported PAA, whereas the typical control condition produces decreases. However, large SDcorr values suggest that additional variables, possibly related to individual differences, further moderate the effects of exercise on PAA. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Acutely, emotional effects of exercise remain confusing, both positive and negative effects being reported. Results of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are more consistent in indicating that aerobic exercise training has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and protects against harmful consequences of stress. Details of each of these effects remain unclear. Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been demonstrated most clearly in subclinical disorder, and clinical applications remain to be exploited. Cross-sectional studies link exercise habits to protection from harmful effects of stress on physical and mental health, but causality is not clear. Nevertheless, the pattern of evidence suggests the theory that exercise training recruits a process which confers enduring resilience to stress. This view allows the effects of exercise to be understood in terms of existing psychobiological knowledge, and it can thereby provide the theoretical base that is needed to guide future research in this area. Clinically, exercise training continues to offer clinical psychologists a vehicle for nonspecific therapeutic social and psychological processes. It also offers a specific psychological treatment that may be particularly effective for patients for whom more conventional psychological interventions are less acceptable.

abstract = {Controlled interpersonal affect regulation refers to the deliberate regulation of someone else's affect. Building on existing research concerning this everyday process, the authors describe the development of a theoretical classification scheme that distinguishes between the types of strategy used to achieve interpersonal affect regulation. To test the theoretical classification, the authors generated a corpus of 378 distinct strategies using self-report questionnaires and diaries completed by student and working samples. Twenty participants then performed a card-sort of the strategies. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine how well the theoretical classification represented spontaneous understandings of controlled interpersonal affect regulation. The final classification primarily distinguished between strategies used to improve versus those used to worsen others' affect, and between strategies that engaged the target in a situation or affective state versus relationship-oriented strategies. The classification provides a meaningful basis for organizing existing research and making future conceptual and empirical distinctions.},

Here we review the key physiological systems implicated in the link between social ties and health and the neural mechanisms that may translate social experiences into downstream health-relevant physiological responses. Specifically, we suggest that threats to social connection may tap into the same neural and physiological 'alarm system' that responds to other critical survival threats, such as the threat or experience of physical harm. Similarly, experiences of social connection may tap into basic reward-related mechanisms that have inhibitory relationships with threat-related responding. Indeed, the neurocognitive correlates of social disconnection and connection may be important mediators for understanding the relationships between social ties and health.},

abstract = {The effects of physical exercise stress on the endocannabinoid system in humans are almost unexplored. In this prospective study, we investigated in a crossover design and under field conditions at different altitudes the effects of physical exercise on the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in 12 trained healthy volunteers. For determination of alterations on the ECS three different protocols were analyzed: Protocol A (physical exercise at lower altitude) involved strenuous hiking below 2,100 m, whereas Protocol B (physical exercise by active ascent to high altitude) involved hiking up to 3,196 m, an accommodation at the cottage and a descent the next day. Protocol C (passive ascent) included a helicopter ascent to 3,196 m, an overnight stay at this altitude and a flight back to the base camp the following day. The cumulative hiked altitude in Protocol A and B was comparable ({\~{}}1,650 m). The blood EC concentrations of anandamide increased significantly in Protocol A/B from baseline (T0) 0.12 ± 0.01/0.16 ± 0.02 (mean ± SEM) to 0.27 ± 0.02/0.42 ± 0.02 after exercise (T1) (p {\textless} 0.05). Anandamide levels in Protocol C remained stable at 0.20 ± 0.02. We conclude that the ECS is activated upon strenuous exercise whereas the combination with hypoxic stress further increases its activity. The reduced partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude alone did not affect this system. In summary, physical exercise activates the endocannabinoid system, whereas the combination with high altitude enhances this activation. This discloses new perspectives to adaptation mechanisms to physical exercise.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) In the study of synaptic transmission, the field of endocannabinoid research is flowering. A wealth of recent findings has revealed critical molecular underpinnings of endocannabinoid generation and signal transduction, and the subcellular localization of these processes within neurons has been mapped with increasing detail. Sophisticated techniques of neuronal imaging and electrophysiological recording have combined to yield new insights into the timing and regulation of endocannabinoid signaling at synapses throughout the brain, and these discoveries are beginning to influence models of synaptic computation and plasticity on a profound level. Triggered by membrane depolarization, intracellular Ca2+ elevation, and/or activation of Gq/11-coupled metabotropic receptors, postsynaptically released endocannabinoids act at presynaptic CB1 receptors to mediate retrograde synaptic inhibition at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and on timescales that are either transient (on a scale of seconds) or long lasting. By dynamically modulating synapse reliability, synaptic suppression mediated by endocannabinoids provides a means for postsynaptic neurons to "tune" the sensitivity of their synaptic inputs to afferent patterns of stimulation. This may in turn help to regulate burst firing, or to generate or maintain synchronous membrane oscillations in interconnected neuronal populations. Endocannabinoid-dependent long-term synaptic depression (LTD) has also been recently demonstrated to underlie multiple forms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STOP) in the cerebral cortex, long thought to regulate the neuronal representation of sensory maps. In this chapter, I briefly survey updated concepts and mechanisms of endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity, and discuss the possible functional relevance of these processes to perception and behavior.

abstract = {The anatomical distribution and density of cannabinoid receptors in the human brain was studied in one fetal (33 weeks gestation), two neonatal (aged three to six months) and eight adult (aged 21-81 years) human cases using quantitative receptor autoradiography following in vitro labelling of sections with the synthetic cannabinoid agonist [3H]CP55,940. Cannabinoid receptors were distributed in a heterogeneous fashion throughout the adult human brain and spinal cord. The allocortex contained very high concentrations of cannabinoid receptor binding sites in the dentate gyrus, Ammons's horn and subiculum of the hippocampal formation; high concentrations of receptors were also present in the entorhinal cortex and amygdaloid complex. Cannabinoid receptor binding sites were also present throughout all regions of the neocortex, where they showed a marked variation in density between the primary, secondary and associational cortical regions: the greatest densities of receptors were present in the associational cortical regions of the frontal and limbic lobes, with moderate densities in the secondary sensory and motor cortical regions, and with the lowest densities of receptors in the primary sensory and motor cortical regions. Relatively high concentrations of cannabinoid receptors were consistently seen in cortical regions of the left (dominant) hemisphere, known to be associated with verbal language functions. In all of the cortical regions, the pattern and density of receptor labelling followed the neocortical laminar organization, with the greatest density of receptors localized in two discrete bands--a clearly delineated narrow superficial band which coincided with lamina I and a deeper broader, conspicuous band of labelling which corresponded to laminae V and VI. Labelling in the intervening cortical laminae (II-IV) showed lower densities, with a well delineated narrow band of label in the middle of laminae IV in the associational cortical regions. The thalamus showed a distinctive heterogeneous distribution of cannabinoid receptors, with the highest concentration of receptors localized in the mediodorsal nucleus, anterior nuclear complex, and in the midline and intralaminar complex of nuclei, i.e. in thalamic nuclei which have connectional affiliations with the associational cortical areas. The basal ganglia showed a distinctive heterogeneous pattern of receptor binding, with the very highest concentrations in the globus pallidus internus, moderate concentrations in the globus pallidus externus and ventral pallidum, and moderately low levels of binding throughout the striatal complex. In the midbrain, some of the highest levels of cannabinoid receptor binding sites in the human brain were present in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, with very low levels of labelling in all other midbrain areas. The highest densities of cannabinoid receptor binding in the hindbrain were localized in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, with moderate densities of receptors in the nucleus of the solitary tract. The spinal cord showed very low levels of receptor binding. Studies on the distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the fetal and neonatal human brain showed similar patterns of receptor distribution to that observed in the adult human brain, except that the density of receptor binding was generally markedly higher, especially in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. The pattern of cannabinoid receptor labelling in the striatum showed a striking patchy pattern of organization which was especially conspicuous in the fetal brain. These results show that cannabinoid receptor binding sites in the human brain are localized mainly in: forebrain areas associated with higher cognitive functions; forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain areas associated with the control of movement; and in hindbrain areas associated with the control of motor and sensory functions of the autonomic nervous system.

Although few data exist to assess trends for participation in sport, there is little evidence of change in the past decade among adults. Large cohort studies suggest that such participation in sport is associated with a 20-40{\%} reduction in all-cause mortality compared with non-participation. Randomised trials and crossover clinical studies suggest that playing sport is associated with specifi c health benefi ts. Some sports have relatively high injury risk although neuromuscular training programmes can prevent various lower extremity injuries. Clinicians can infl uence a large number of patients through brief interventions that promote physical activity, and encouragement toward participation in sport for some physically inactive patients qualifi es as evidencebased therapy.

abstract = {The public health problem of physical inactivity has proven resistant to research efforts aimed at elucidating its causes and interventions designed to alter its course. Thus, in most industrialized countries, the majority of the population is physically inactive or inadequately active. Most theoretical models of exercise behaviour assume that the decision to engage in exercise is based on cognitive factors (e.g. weighing pros and cons, appraising personal capabilities, evaluating sources of support). Another, still-under-appreciated, possibility is that these decisions are influenced by affective variables, such as whether previous exercise experiences were associated with pleasure or displeasure. This review examines 33 articles published from 1999 to 2009 on the relationship between exercise intensity and affective responses. Unlike 31 studies that were published until 1998 and were examined in a 1999 review, these more recent studies have provided evidence of a relation between the intensity of exercise and affective responses. Pleasure is reduced mainly above the ventilatory or lactate threshold or the onset of blood lactate accumulation. There are pleasant changes at sub-threshold intensities for most individuals, large inter-individual variability close to the ventilatory or lactate threshold and homogeneously negative changes at supra-threshold intensities. When the intensity is self-selected, rather than imposed, it appears to foster greater tolerance to higher intensity levels. The evidence of a dose-response relation between exercise intensity and affect sets the stage for a reconsideration of the rationale behind current guidelines for exercise intensity prescription. Besides effectiveness and safety, it is becoming increasingly clear that the guidelines should take into account whether a certain level of exercise intensity would be likely to cause increases or decreases in pleasure.},

abstract = {In the current revival of interest in the emotional and mental lives of animals, many investigators have focused attention on mammalian infants that emit distress vocalizations when separated from the home environment. Perhaps the most intensively studied distress vocalization is the ultrasonic vocalization of infant rats. Since its discovery, this vocalization has been interpreted both as a communicatory signal for the elicitation of maternal retrieval and as the manifestation of emotional distress. In contrast, the authors examined the cardiovascular causes and consequences of the vocalization, and on the basis of this work, they hypothesized that the vocalization is the acoustic by-product of the abdominal compression reaction (ACR), a maneuver that results in increased venous return to the heart. Therefore, the vocalization may be analogous to a sneeze, serving a physiological function while incidentally producing sound.},

abstract = {An online survey was used to explore emotion regulation strategies used by runners (N = 506, mean age = 37.69 years, SD = 8.84 years) in the hour prior to training or competition. Content analysis of responses identified 28 categories of emotion regulation strategy, with the most popular being goal setting (23{\%}), distraction (12{\%}), recall of past performance accomplishments (12{\%}), and anticipated pleasant emotions after running (10{\%}). Participants reported greater use of cognitive strategies than behavioural ones, with responses suggesting that emotion regulation and performance management are closely related. Given this cognitive focus, and given the performance aspect inherent to running, it is suggested that individuals' approaches to emotion regulation in sport and exercise contexts differ somewhat from those involved in general daily activities reported in the social psychology literature.

Mood linkage was greater when players were happier and engaged in collective activity. An intraperson analysis of data from these teams and 2 other teams showed that mood linkage was also greater for players who were older, more committed to the team, and more susceptible to emotional contagion.

We conducted four studies (two correlational, one experi- ence-sampling, and one intervention study) to determine outcomes associated with activ- ities motivated by hedonic and eudaimonic aims. Overall, results indicated that: between persons (at the trait level) and within persons (at the momentary state level), hedonic pursuits related more to positive affect and carefreeness, while eudaimonic pursuits related more to meaning; between persons, eudaimonia related more to elevating experience (awe, inspiration, and sense of connection with a greater whole); within persons, hedonia related more negatively to negative affect; between and within persons, both pursuits related equally to vitality; and both pursuits showed some links with life satisfaction, though hedonias links were more frequent. People whose lives were high in both eudaimonia and hedonia had: higher degrees of most well-being variables than people whose lives were low in both pursuits (but did not differ in negative affect or carefreeness); higher positive affect and carefreeness than predominantly eudaimonic individuals; and higher meaning, elevating experience, and vitality than predominantly hedonic individuals. In the inter- vention study, hedonia produced more well-being benefits at short-term follow-up, while eudaimonia produced more at 3-month follow-up. The findings show that hedonia and eudaimonia occupy both overlapping and distinct niches within a complete picture of well- being, and their combination may be associated with the greatest well-being.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical work in cognitive science and neuroscience is brought into contact with the concept of the flow experience. After a brief exposition of brain function, the explicit-implicit distinction is applied to the effortless information processing that is so characteristic of the flow state. The explicit system is associated with the higher cognitive functions of the frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe structures and has evolved to increase cognitive flexibility. In contrast, the implicit system is associated with the skill-based knowledge supported primarily by the basal ganglia and has the advantage of being more efficient. From the analysis of this flexibility/efficiency trade-off emerges a thesis that identifies the flow state as a period during which a highly practiced skill that is represented in the implicit system's knowledge base is implemented without interference from the explicit system. It is proposed that a necessary prerequisite to the experience of flow is a state of transient hypofrontality that enables the temporary suppression of the analytical and meta-conscious capacities of the explicit system. Examining sensory-motor integration skills that seem to typify flow such as athletic performance, writing, and free-jazz improvisation, the new framework clarifies how this concept relates to creativity and opens new avenues of research. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that these anxiety-transfer processes may be exploited strategically when attempting to regulate relationship partners' emotion. More generally, anxiety may serve as either a warning signal to other people about threat (alerting function) or an appeal for emotional support or practical help (comfort-seeking function). Tensions between these two interpersonal functions may account for mutually incongruent interpersonal responses to expressed anxiety, including mistargeted interpersonal regulation attempts. Because worry waxes and wanes over time as a function of other people's ongoing reactions, interpersonal interventions may help to alleviate some of its maladaptive consequences.},

These FPFS loyalty (FPFSL) metaperception components as third-eye party are seen to be highly sensitive and vigilant with regard to transgressions of the cultural maxim-based norms. Then these metaperception components are supposed to help prompt the transgressor to generate emotions of guilt and shame in his/her reflection.},
annote = {Chinese maxims of guilt and shame

guilt and shame conceived and experienced differently in different cultures

Guilt and shame in China: Bedford, 2004; Ho, Fu {\&} Ng, 2004; Hong, 2004

Emotions such as guilt and shame arise from reflective judgments about the transgression of cultural norms and are closely connected with ‘the evaluative standards jointly set by cultural ideals and personal transformations of them' (Hong, 2004, p. 60）

the responsibility of helping keep the stability of the state through developing the individual's awareness of loyalty in interpersonal relationships in general and toward the ruler in particular (will this lead to a bias in responses in order to keep harmony? will the variance of "individual" responses diminish? How to ilicit the responses I am looking for re social bonding and dissonance?)



This cultivation of personhood would lead to the regulation of families, in turn to the regulation of states, and ultimately to the regulation of the whole empire




These evaluative standards are fundamentally fostered by and embedded in cultural norms.

CHINA: human self–other relational morality replaces religion (Bodde, 1946; Liang, 1998).

loyalty-based metaperception

filial piety and fraternal submission loyalty (FPFSL) metaperception

(1) a relational conception of emotions and their significance in social interactions, 
which underlie the public-outward and the private-inward facets of social behavior in Confucian societies

(2) other-consciousness for the emergence of selfhood as necessary a condition as self-consciousness, both needing to be conceived together, with the role of metacognition as a central factor for the development of the social self.

‘Above, there are the old; below, there are the young.'
上有老，下有小


This reflects their awareness of responsibilities to be assumed by parents and by children. This also reflects the general case of Chinese family life in terms of responsibilities to perform

above a couple (or a self) there are parents to take care of, and below the couple (or the self) there are children to support. That is to say, they have responsibilities to support their parents and their children at the same time

the couple must try their best to
offer everything possible to satisfy their parents，materially and spiritually。

obey the parents for their happiness and not to lead them to be angry in terms of filial piety

In turn, the sons and daughters, younger brothers and sisters and younger brothers- and sisters-in-law are submissive to them in terms of love and respect

all the family members are instructed to follow the rule of living in harmony through showing respect for the old and showing love for the young in and outside of family.

Instructions in family life take very seriously such mis- behaviors as dishonesty, quarreling, stealing, indolence, and require all family members to prevent these. If any of these occurs, relevant members are seriously criticized (as if they were part of the one self!)

Thus, in the Chinese family-clan-based society, each individual is viewed as connected at least with two other generations. Thus, the three immediately connected generations, the father, the self (each individual), and the son, form the most basic family clan, with the self as its core.

The cultivation of personhood starting in the family through ‘the collective cultural voices (cultural forces) exert[ing] pressures intended to produce individual members (cultural products) who “fit” extant cultural ideals'


Confucianism and moral codes are the most important factor contributing to the cohesiveness of Chinese civilization (Stavrianos, 1971)

They focus on the establishment of a happy and well-organized society as cultural ideals.

Loyalty in interpersonal relationships is deemed as indispensable

The origin of this feeling of loyalty is the sentiment of grati- tude shown to parents by the children or the sentiment of gratitude shown for the favor of bearing them and bringing them up or the sentiment of love shown to the elder brother by the younger brother for his support in the early years of growth

(recall Xuanzi reminding me about connecting with mum on my birthday, its not my day, it should be a day for thanking my mum and dad for raising me!)

Confucian thinking on the development of FPFSL is concerned with the prevention of individuals' offending against their superiors for the social order

The philosopher You said, ‘There are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission!—Are they not the root of all benevolent actions?' (The Confucian Analects, p. 65)

The structure of family relationships is seen as the political hierarchy of the state. Actually, a family is seen as a small state, and the state as a large family (guojia—the state family in its literal translation).

Family members and the sovereign of the state are assumed to take responsibility for each other.

The Confucian belief is that the proper governing of states is contingent on 
the cultivation of persons (personhood or selfhood) in families

They are expected to become sincere in their thoughts and rectified in their hearts in terms of ‘mutual loyalty to relationships' and observe the three fundamental principles

This loyalty is embodied in the design of the three principles of
benevolence, (loving others)
righteousness, and 
propriety,
which are interrelated requirements for individuals in Chinese cultural ideals.

Benevolence: one should do righteous deeds for one's neighbor in a proper, good, polite, and honorable manner

characteristic of taking responsibilities for others without directly requiring one's own rights. This is the essence of the Confucian construct of filial piety and fraternal submission

Loyalty in basic interpersonal relationships, incubated in family life in the form of FPFS, is deduced from the biological responsibilities and obligations an individual assumes for other blood-related members of the family


The Collection of Sages' Maxims (CSM)
major cultural-historical voices and establishes ‘the evaluative standards' of loyalty, against which trans- gression and violation of social normative maxims would arouse such emotions as guilt and shame (Ho et al., 2004)

The CSM is taken, in this respect, as performing the task of implementing Humboldt's idea of education on the individual level as the goal of humans, and for the purpose of broader humanity of reaching an ideal. 

The CSM can also be used to reveal psychical laws in V{\"{o}}lkerpsychologie by understanding ‘the historical forces that underlie collective life', and by ‘discovering the very nature of collective mental life' (Diriw{\"{a}}chter, 2004, p. 92).

History:
Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). It circulated widely among the people in the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) and in the period of the Republic of China (1912–1949).

Content:
rhyming maxims, taken either from classical works, or directly from everyday vernacular expressions of common people, were so easy to read and memorize that their influence was no less than that of the classics of Confucius and Mencius

They had and still have a profound and lasting impact on China's politics, economy, ideological culture, people's customs and their psychological qualities (Guo {\&} Zhang, 1999; Wu, 1989; Yuan, 1988).

They are still often heard cited in daily communication today, orally or in written form, by common people as well as by intellectuals. For example, they are used as dicta, proverbs, mottos, and so on, or as themes in novels, movies, TV programs, news commentaries, textbooks, operas, paintings, calligraphies, couplets, posters, poems, songs, ads, and so on.

culture-bound nature of loyalty metaperception in the culturally constituted relational worlds

These maxims and embedded cognitive construals determine the shades of the characteristics of loyalty metaperception. The editions of the CSM used for this research were taken from the books annotated by T.-D. Yuan and by C.-Q. Wu and republished in 1988 and 1989, respectively.

Each cluster net has been made to reflect an actual integrative discourse for children's actual facilitated internalization of metacognition components in learning, and their actual development of metaperception in values or worldviews as a result.

1. AM: which is parents' suggestion, taken as the moral/ethical code underlying cultural ideals and collective and personal meanings.

2. IM: which is concerned with using the specific examples to illustrate the code of AM to family members.

3. RM: which serves as the more practicable requirement of people in the family for their daily behavior.

‘culturally expected, appropriate, “normative” behavior, at both collective and personal levels.' 

In RM, transgressions of personally interpreted ideals in social events and contexts are likely to be detected, and the meanings and consequences ascribed to the transgressions (including metaperception) can be reflected and typically represented

Eg:
AM: Harmony begets auspices, while disharmony begets perversities. (514)

IM: A family cannot be ruined as long as there is a harmony between father and sons; family properties cannot be divided up for theirliving apart as long as there is a harmony among brothers; lawsuit contesting would cease as long as there is a harmony among fellow villagers; familial fortunes can thrive as long as there is a harmony between husband and wife. (18)

"RM: If two persons are of one mind, they will have enough money to buy bullions of gold; if each of the two persons has a different mind, they will have no money to buy a needle. (53)" !!!! FUSION

CCMF 1: [two persons of one mind/enough money to buy bullions of gold, each of a different mind/no money to buy a needle].

a happy and well- organized society in this world require harmony among people and result in their development of a relational self-conscious selfhood characteristic of other-consciousness

This harmony-seeking self–other consciousness is, first and foremost, developed among the four basic culturally significant family-based relations: father and son, elder brother and younger brother, family members with other villagers, husband and wife

The significance of this harmony-seeking lies in the need to support each other for shared interests or in terms of the convenience of neighbors available (non-family members)



(2) To Show Filial Piety to Parents and Respect for Elder Brothers (Filial Piety and Brotherly Love)

AM: The first thing we should do is to show filial piety to our parents, and show love and respect to our elder brothers, which is the radical to be established for practical courses to grow up. (5)

IM: A crow has the filial duty of feeding parents in return; a lamb has the knowledge to kneel down to express gratitude to its mother when sucking milk. (12)

RM: To keep in mind parents' remaining days and make them feel happy to show filial piety without delaying doing that till their portraits are engraved for the memorial ceremonies, as in case of Ding Lan; to kill an ox for sacrificial offerings to lay before the parents' tombs is not so good as to offer them chickens and pork when they are alive. (14)

CCMF 2: [making them feel happy by offering chickens {\&} pork when they are alive {\textgreater}|{\textless} engraving their portraits for memorial ceremonies by killing a cow for sacrificial offerings when they are dead].



The harmony building of one mind of two persons in the four most basic relationships is realized through the construct of filial piety and fraternal submission (FPFS).

particularly focusing on the prohibition of offending against superiors

(3) To Pay Adequate Attention to the Education of Children (Educating Children)

(1) To encourage parents to attach great importance to the education of children:

AM: If one is rich, but fails to instruct the children, the money and grain will certainly drain away; if one is a noble, but fails to instruct the children, his official costume and hat cannot be kept long. (389)

IM: If one is able to follow Mencius's mother's example and move house three times for her son's education, he can surely expect all his sons to be successful as Yanshan's five sons. (390)

RM: You should know that young children are worth instructing, and you should not say that they know nothing. (191)

(2) To motivate children to study hard:

AM: You should set up your aspiration for erudition, and you should ask relevant questions and make relevant reflections. (188)

IM: Your names are to be the first on the list of successful candidates overnight; you are to be invited to royal posts after ten years' efforts. (192)

RM: You must concentrate on what you are reading; each word is worth a thousand pieces of gold. (29)

In order for FPFSL to prevail, scholarly education is necessary as part of the concern of loyalty to self–other interpersonal relationship. A basic concern of parents is to prevent the family from being ruined, and this prevention is directly seen to be based on the education of their children

If parents neglected the education of their children, they would feel ashamed or guilty, because they would lose their money and grain or official positions symbolized by ‘official costume and hat.'

CCMF 3 (1): [children worth instructing {\textgreater}|{\textless} saying they know nothing].

CCMF 3 (2): [concentration on reading {\textgreater}|{\textless} each word worth 10,000 pieces of gold].


4. Strong WIll: Stoicism? 

AM: Not until the sheaths have fallen off can a bamboo shoot become a bamboo; not until it has rushed about can the fish become a dragon. (146)

IM: As long as there are green poplar trees to attach the horse, there are roads everywhere leading to the capital city of Chang'an. (309)

RM: If Heaven wants to set misfortune on a person, it is bound to conceit him with trifling fortune—when the fortune comes you should not feel happy, but learn to bear it; if Heaven wants to bless a person, it is bound to warn him with trifling misfortune—when the misfortune comes, you should not feel worried, but learn to get relieved of it. (616)

to maintain confidence when meeting with misfortunes. Children are expected to endure and overcome difficulties and chal- lenges before they become mature and successful in reaching their life goals. Two metaphors, ‘a bamboo shoot's becoming a bamboo' and ‘a fish's becoming a dragon', refer to maturity and success in the development of a strong will. Grit, 

CCMF 4: [fortune coming {\&} not feeling happy but learning to bear {\textless}|{\textgreater} misfortune coming {\&} not feeling worried but learning to get relieved of it].



(5) To Develop Moral Integrity (Moral Integrity)

AM: Flowers showing off the spring scenery—a gale of raining and wind blowing presses them to go back to the dust; bamboos firm with elegant sentiment—days of frost and snow make them lofty- and proud-looking stems of jades. (283)

IM: Irises and orchids (symbolic of noble character, true friendship, or beautiful surroundings), growing in the deep forest, send off their fragrance even when there are no people; men of cultivation, culti- vating their morality, do not abandon their personal integrity even when they are poor and distressed. (660)

RM: An honest official may dare to drink water from the greed-making spring; a person with noble aspirations would not eat the humiliating food. (668)

CCMF 5: [an honest official drinking water from greedy spring ?|? a person with noble aspirations not eating humiliating food].



Tt is because of this third-eye party that the same emotion takes on two interchangeable forms, FPFSL guilt and shame. These components of the FPFSL metaperception may be seen as the sensitive perception from which to generate the three types of guilt, nei jiu, zui e gan, and fan zui gan, and the basis on which to generate the four types of shame, diu lian, can kui, xiu kui, and xiu chi, as Bedford (2004) distinguishes them. 

The FPFSL metaperception components as the third-eye party are the outcome of the cultivation of the cultural metacognition components in learning. The instruction of sages' maxims in family on the part of parents is actually the process of cultivating the capacity and capability of the cultural metacognition in learning.

These components help generate the emotions of guilt and shame in order to terminate and eliminate the misbehavior by meeting the following requirements:
1. two persons/parties involved; 2. obligations and responsibilities assumed between them; 3. something wrong/transgression of expectations in relation; 4. serious consequences; 5. other-consciousness; 6. negative self-reflection; 7. negative self-perception; 8. other people's possible negative comments.

Their regulating function is performed through generating emotions of guilt and shame

The metaperception components help prescribe the order of society and develop people's sense of right and wrong

Here other people's negative comments in his mind's eye in reflection are essential to the negative feelings of guilt and shame.

Conclusion:From Maxims to Meta-Reflection

In China, the cultivation of a person's sense of metacognition/metaperception as the third-eye party in terms of mutual or collective expectations begins to be fostered from an early age by being told ‘Shame, Shame' accompanied by quickly touching the face upon the unexpected behavior, such as crying, urinating in public, or blaming someone by saying ‘You don't know shame.' So the sense of cultural metaperception determines a person's disposition, personality, and his/her general worries or concerns

The FPFSL metaperception as the third-eye party is semiotically rooted in common sense and language.

So all people have emotions of guilt and shame, yet the underlying invisible reasons for these emotions can be different from culture to culture. These reasons are different because the cultural metaperception that determines or justifies them is differ- ent in terms of its cultural constituents},

abstract = {Are people more likely to be cooperative if they must act quickly or if they have more time to mull it over? The results of a recent series of studies suggest that peoples' initial impulse is to cooperate, but that with more time and reflection they become more selfish.},
annote = {In a recent series of studies, Rand et al. [4] used the currently popular dual-process model of human decision-making to ask: are humans intuitively altruistic or selfish, and does more time and reflection change this initial tendency?

Method:
10 experiments
In most of the studies, groups of four anonymous participants played a public goods game with one another online

Prisoner's Dilemma (2012):
cooperation benefits everyone, if everyone does it, whereas selfishness benefits the subject even more, regardless of what the others do (Figure 1)

1st study Results:
participants who responded fastest in a public goods game were also the ones who were most cooperative

2nd studies: 
In the first set, participants were required either to act quickly or else to delay their response. 
Results: manipulation caused participants to respond differentially: acting more quickly led to more altruistic responses, whereas delaying led to more selfish responses

In a second set of experiments, participants were primed either for quick, intuitive action or thoughtful, reflective action:
Results: participants acting after an intuitive prime were more cooperative, whereas those acting after a reflective prime were more selfish

Validated by other findings:
1. when humans play a public goods game repeatedly, they start off being mostly cooperative; however, over time, with different partners, they tend to become more selfish ? possibly because they have more time to think over the costs and benefits to themselves (Fehr {\&} Gachter 2000)

2. people make all kinds of moral decisions based more on intuition and emotion than on rational reflection (Haidt 2012)
----{\textgreater} "moral dumbfounding": subjects intuitively judge that something such as brother–sister incest is disgusting, even if they cannot justify this decision rationally

3. hypothesis that early in ontogeny, one- year-olds help and share with others quite readily, almost indiscriminately, and only over the next couple of years do they become more cautious and selective in targeting their altruism to those who will not take advantage of them (Warneken {\&} Tomasello 2009)

Pinker's Puzzle: 
Evidence that humans have become less violent and more cooperative over the past few thousand years...
This is almost certainly not because humans' intuitive impulses for cooperation have been strengthen- ing. Rather, what is happening is that over historical time individuals are reasoning together and creating social norms to promote cooperation in situations that are often plagued by non-cooperation.
Norm creation is thus a cul- tural–historical process driven mainly by reason, not by intuition.

Children are socialized into a world of historically created social norms to which they are expected to conform, and their intuitive impulse is indeed to conform (Haun {\&} Tomasello 2011). 

The outcome is that most humans, most of the time, have the intuition that their first best choice is either to cooperate or else to conform to the expectations of others – which also means, most often, to cooperate.},

@article{Haidt2015,
annote = {Two competing narratives about modernity: individuals and groups and institutions

the individualist narrative has achieved near-total dominance and that an important next step in moral psychology will be to revive the lost narrative and study morality as the glue that binds together cooperative groups and suppresses selfishness within them.

1. Morality in our intellectual history: 

- The very first writing in Mesopotamia appears to have been used to help merchants record who owed what to whom

- Or note that the Bible begins with a creation story in which the long, strange trip of human exile from Eden was launched by a moral transgression and that the transgression itself was obtaining knowledge of good and evil (65)

- Greek philosophy: Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics - extended inquiries into the nature and origins of good persons and good societies

- Aristotle's emphasis on habit, Hume's critique of reason, Kant's categorical imperative, and J.S. Mill's ideas on liberty and utility all crop up in modern discussions of moral education and moral psychology

2. Two stories about modernity:

- sociologist Christian Smith (2003) has argued that humans are moral, believing, narrating animals.We need to live in a moral order that is created by shared stories and that offers beliefs about who we are, what we ought to do, and what is sacred.

implicit metanarratives of communities:

1. Liberal-progress narrative:

traditional societies were reprehensible because of their deep-rooted inequality, exploitation, and irrational traditionalism...But the noble human aspiration for autonomy, equality, and prosperity struggled mightily against the forces of misery and oppression, and eventually succeeded

2. community-lost narrative:

Once upon a time, folk lived together in local, face to face com- munities where we knew and took care of each other . . . . life was securely woven in homespun fabrics of organic, integrated culture, faith, and tradition . . . But then a dreadful thing happened: Folk community was overrun by the barbarisms of modern industry, urbanization, rationality, science, fragmentation, anonymity . . .

Smith: this metanarrative has dropped out of the academic imagination (with a few notable exceptions, e.g., Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, {\&} Tipton, 1985; Putnam, 2000)

Tocqueville, Tonnies, Marx, andWeber all warned, in different ways, of the alienating effects of the loss of social connection and animating purpose as people's lives became ever more governed by an industrial economy and a bureaucratic legal and political system

Durkheim grasped the essential truth that is now known as the hedonic treadmill (Brickman {\&} Campbell, 1971). In his analysis of suicide, Durkheim (1897/1951) wrote, ‘‘The more one has, the more one wants, since satisfactions received only stimulate instead of filling needs'' (p. 248).

Durkheim believed that people need constraints to flourish and that a cohesive society provides a regulative force that plays ‘‘the same role for moral needs which the organism plays for physical needs'' (p. 248).

society is like an organism that has an internal structure and a division of labor that allows it to function properly when it achieves a high enough level of cohesiveness (66).

Durkheim on Schools and morality:
Schools would have to cultivate a spirit of disci- pline (the cold, authoritarian part of morality), an attachment to groups (the warm part that makes one want to fit in), and a sense of autonomy in subjecting oneself to the rules of valued groups

3. The Main line in Moral Psychology:

Piaget's work was a direct response to Durkheim

Durkheim's emphasis on the value of discipline, constraint, and bending the will of the child fits closely with the strict father view of the family that Lakoff (1996) said is the foundational metaphor of conservative thought (67)

Piaget's child-centered and antiauthoritarian views harmonize with the nurturant parent ideal that Lakoff said is the foundational metaphor of liberal thought. In

Kohlberg (1969): found a stage-like progression from preconven- tional responses, in which actions are considered right or wrong on the basis of anticipated punishment, through conventional responses, in which actions are considered right or wrong de- pending on their fit with the rules of society. The highest moral stages, which many adolescents never reach, require postcon- ventional responses, in which one goes beyond one's society and justifies rules with references to abstract and universal princi- ples of justice.

-- Corrections thereafter from Gilligan (1982), Nucci {\&} Turiel (1978) : Moral development does not follow a single trajectory from conventionality to true morality; knowl- edge in each domain develops in parallel

Kohlberg and his cognitive-developmental approach became the main line in moral psychology in part by defeating the twin dragons that had long dominated psychology: psychoanalysis and behaviorism. (67)

Freud: His topographic model of the mind (conscious, precon- scious, unconscious; Freud, 1900/1976) and his later structural model of the mind (id, ego, superego; Freud, 1923/1962) were both attempts to explain how people can know what is right and yet act or think in ways that cause them to feel shame.

The great puzzle is how children come to reign in their desires—why they feel badly when they hurt (some) people and violate (some) rules. Freud's developmental model of psychosexual stages (e.g., theOedipal/Electra complex, followed by identification with the same-sex parent) was an effort to solve this puzzle.

Kohlberg (1969) criticized Freud fiercely, pointing to the
consistent failure of empirical attempts to relate children's early family environments to later personality outcomes, including moral ones. 

Kohlberg agreed with Freud that children go through an invariant sequence of stages, but these, he argued, were the Piagetian stages of cognitive development, which en- abled new ways of representing and transforming social knowledge. 

Kohlberg had good timing; in the 1960s and 1970s, the cognitive revolution was replacing behavioral and psycho- analytic approaches with a new emphasis on information processing (67)

Behaviourism: 
Learning theorists had always placed the emphasis on moral behavior (see Skinner, 1971) rather than on moral emotions (Freud) or moral reasoning (Kohlberg). The famous Bobo doll study (Bandura, Ross, {\&} Ross, 1961) showed that children will imitate aggressive be- havior without regard to Oedipal attachments, Piagetian struc- tural change, or even reinforcement.

behaviorism had two lasting influences on moral psychology: one through Bandura, and the other through automaticity research.

Bargh and Ferguson (2000) ex- plicitly credit behaviorism for showing how profoundly and unconsciously human behavior is shaped by subtle cues in the environment (68)

The cognitive-developmental approach to morality is the
‘‘main line'' of moral psychology. The line runs from Piaget to Kohlberg to Gilligan, Turiel, and Nucci and then on to their students and many other researchers who have analyzed children's reasoning and the development of cognitive structures related to morality

4. The new synthesis in moral psychology:

E.O. Wilson (1975: 562) ‘‘ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers and biologicized''

Wilson predicted that evolutionary and neural approaches would meet in the study of the moral emotions:

". . . ethical philosophers intuit the deontological canons of mo- rality by consulting the emotive centers of their own hypotha- lamic-limbic system. This is also true of the developmentalists [such as Kohlberg], even when they are being their most severely objective. Only by interpreting the activity of the emotive centers as a biological adaptation can the meaning of the canons be de- ciphered" (p. 563).


Two shifts occurred in the 1980s that laid the groundwork forWilson's synthesis to begin in the 1990s. 

The first was the affective revolution—the broad new interest in emotions that followed the cognitive revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. 

The second was the rebirth of sociobiology as evolu- tionary psychology

Social Psychology:

Social psychologists developed a variety of dual-process ex- planations of behavior in which affective and cognitive, or ‘‘hot'' and ‘‘cool''systems, worked in tandem—andsometimes at cross- purposes—and the entire architecture was explained in evolu- tionary terms (Metcalfe {\&} Mischel, 1999; Zajonc, 1980)

In the 1990s, John Bargh (1994) proposed that mental processes fell along a continuum from fully automatic to fully controlled. Automatic processes are what brains have been doing for hun- dreds of millions of years: fast, effortless, and efficient mental processing that is closely linked to the perceived world. 

Automatic processes cause cognitive and behavioral changes in response to the environment without any need for conscious reflection or awareness

Controlled processes, in contrast, are made possible by the evolutionarily recent human acquisition of language and the capacity for private reflection. They are mental processes that occur more slowly, with conscious awareness, and that are more easily separated from perception

Bargh and his colleagues have shown that many morally relevant behaviors (e.g., altruism, racism, or rudeness) can be caused by automatic processes triggered by subtle environmental cues (Bargh, Chen, {\&} Burrows, 1996)


Around the same time that Bargh (1994) published an early
major statement on automaticity, two books were released that made complementary developments in neuroscience and pri- matology accessible to many psychologists.

1. Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, Antonio Damasio (1994) described his studies of people who had sustained damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
-These patients retained a basic knowledge of moral and social rules, yet they had great difficulty incorporating this knowledge into their behavior.
- somatic marker hypothesis. He suggested that brain areas that are involved in bodily reactions to real events are activated when we merely imagine similar events. These activations provide us with gut feelings—visceral flashes of positive or negative affect.
- In essence we use our bodies—as represented in the brain—as sounding boards that tell us instantly, without the need for reflection, that a certain course of action is repulsive or attractive (69).


2. Frans de Waal (1996) published Good Na-
tured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals.

four areas of primate sociality: 
1. sympathy and caring behaviors, 
2. rank and social order, 
3. reciprocity, 
4. community concern—the ways that chimpanzees seem to care about and regulate conflict within their groups

--{\textgreater} apes show most of the psychological building blocks that humans use to construct moral systems and communities (69)

These building blocks are primarily emotions—such as feelings of sympathy, fear, anger, and affection—that motivate animals to behave in ways that are adaptive and context-dependent.

The ideas of Bargh (automaticity), Damasio (embodied cognition), de Waal (primate moral emotions), and others (e.g., Frank, 1988; Gib- bard, 1990; Kagan, 1984) converged so well that they inspired me to formulate the social intuitionist model (SIM) of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001)

SIM posits that moral judgment is much like aesthetic judgment—a rapid intuitive process—and defines moral intuitions as:

‘‘the sudden appearance in consciousness, or at the fringe of consciousness, of an evaluative feeling (like-dislike, good-bad) about the character or actions of a person, without any conscious awareness of having gone through steps of search, weighing evi- dence, or inferring a conclusion'' (Haidt {\&} Bjorklund, 2008, p. 188).

moral reasoning is frequent, but given the speed and ubiquity of moral intuition, moral reasoning rarely has a chance to play out in an open and unbiased way, as is often assumed by cognitive-developmental researchers (69)

Rather, consistent with research on motivated reasoning (Kunda, 1990) and everyday reasoning (Kuhn, 1991) people engage in moral reasoning primarily to seek evidence in support of their initial intuition and also to resolve those rare but difficult cases when multiple intuitions conflict

most of the action in moral judgment is in the automatic, affectively laden intuitions, not in conscious verbal reasoning (for reviews, see Haidt, 2007; Haidt {\&} Bjork- lund, 2008) (70)

Greene (in press) has even combined his fMRI research with philosophical arguments to support Wilson's debunking thesis; he argues that deontological philosophy is at its heart a post hoc justification of gut feelings about rights.

5. Future Directions: Broadening the definition of morality

Haidt's definition of morality:

"Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, practices, insti- tutions, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work to- gether to suppress or regulate selfishness and make social life possible"

morality arises from the coevolution of genes and cultural in- novations (Richerson {\&} Boyd, 2005), and it assumes that cul- tures have foundmany ways to build on the broad potential of the human mind to suppress selfishness and form cooperative communities:

One of those ways was laid out by John Stuart Mill and the rationalist traditions that lead up through Kohlberg! 

We might call it an individualist approach to morality because individuals are the fundamental units of moral value. In this ap- proach, selfishness is suppressed by encouraging individuals to empathize with and care for the needy and vulnerable (Gilligan) and to respect the rights of others and fight for justice (Kohlberg) (70)

Most of the world, however, does not take this approach to
suppressing selfishness. 

cultural psychology suggests that, outside of Western nations, issues related to ingroup loyalty, authority, respect, and spiritual purity are often important parts of the moral domain (Haidt, Koller, {\&} Dias, 1993; Jensen, 1998; Shweder, Much, Mahapatra, {\&} Park, 1997)

Many moral systems do not strive to protect the welfare and autonomy of individuals above all else. Traditional moralities more often aim to suppress and regulate selfishness by binding people into larger collectives, such as families, guilds, teams, and congregations.

These societies, which exemplify the Durkheimian virtues of cohesiveness, in- terdependence, and limitations on choice and acquisitiveness (up to a point), exemplify what we might call a binding approach to morality because they treat the group as the fundamental source of moral value and they expect individuals to limit their desires and play their roles within the group (70)

In these communities, the moral domain appears to in- clude at least three additional clusters of issues: 
1. ingroup/loyalty, 
2. authority/respect, 
3. purity/sanctity (Haidt {\&} Graham, 2007)

People in such communities, particularly in rural areas, do
poorly on Kohlbergian measures of moral development (Snarey, 1985).

They cannot seem to transcend traditions and think for themselves about justice.Western conservatives also seem to be morally challenged, although their scores mysteriously rise when they are told to respond to questions in a politically liberal way (Emler, Renwick, {\&} Malone, 1983)

But what happens when people judge stories about treason, disrespect, gluttony, or li- centiousness? Are there additional brain systems contributing to binding moralities?

the dominance of the liberal-progress narrative among academics has obscured parts of the moral domain held dear by most of the world's in- habitants, including those who are hostile to the liberal societies of the West},

abstract = {In this study, a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm originally employed by Takahashi et al. was adapted to look for emotion-specific differences in functional brain activity within a healthy German sample (N = 14), using shame- and guilt-related stimuli and neutral stimuli. Activations were found for both of these emotions in the temporal lobe (shame condition: anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus; guilt condition: fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus). Specific activations were found for shame in the frontal lobe (medial and inferior frontal gyrus), and for guilt in the amygdala and insula. This is consistent with Takahashi et al.'s results obtained for a Japanese sample (using Japanese stimuli), which showed activations in the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, middle occipital gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. During the imagination of shame, frontal and temporal areas (e.g. middle frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus) were responsive regardless of gender. In the guilt condition, women only activate temporal regions, whereas men showed additional frontal and occipital activation as well as a responsive amygdala. The results suggest that shame and guilt share some neural networks, as well as having individual areas of activation. It can be concluded that frontal, temporal and limbic areas play a prominent role in the generation of moral feelings.},

In this review, we explore these positive biological, psychological, and social consequences of pain. We highlight three different domains in which pain may be considered to have positive consequences. First, pain facilitates pleasure by providing an important contrast for pleasurable experiences, increasing sensitivity to sensory input, and facilitating self-rewarding behavior. Second, pain augments self-regulation and enhancement by increasing cognitive control, reducing rumination, and demonstrating virtue. Third, pain promotes affiliation by arousing empathy from others, motivating social connection, and enhancing group formation. Drawing on evidence scattered across a range of academic fields, we provide for reflection on how pain is represented, generate insights into pain-seeking behavior, and draw attention to the role of painful experiences in maximizing positive outcomes.},
annote = {Pain may be evident during intense exercise (O'Connor {\&} Cook, 1999), in some extreme sports (Le Breton, 2000), ice-swimming (Zenner, De Decker, {\&} Clement, 1980), the consumption of chili pepper (Rozin {\&} Schiller, 1980), or various forms of therapy such as deep tissue massage

pain's capacity to produce positive consequences, thereby decoupling the experience of pain from the experience of suffering (cf. Turk {\&} Wilson, 2009).

This effect of pain is often exploited in initiation ceremonies in which the explicit purpose is to provide a passage for the individual into a new identity (e.g., passage into adulthood or a new social identity)

Pain Facilitates Pleasure
pain and pleasure are perhaps better understood as interrelated hedonic states as opposed to polarized experiences

Pain enhances subsequent pleasure. Pain may provide an important contrast for the experience of pleasure:
"Discourse on the Nature of Pleasure and Pain", Verri (1781, cited in Guidi, 1994) argued that pleasure is limited by the amount of pain it removes

It is well known that contrast, comparison, or framing effects determine the relative value of a stimulus (Kahneman {\&} Tversky, 1979; Seymour {\&} McClure, 2008) and that positive (and even negative) stimuli may be experienced as rewarding in the context of (more) negative stimuli (Breiter, Aharon, Kahneman, Dale, {\&} Shiz- gal, 2001; Zellner, Allen, Henley, {\&} Parker, 2006)

The view of pain as a homeostatic drive (A. D. Craig, 2003) provides an important framework for understanding contrast effects.

his process of restoring balance is often expe- rienced as pleasurable and the more effective a stimulus is in restoring bodily homeostasis, the more that stimulus is experienced as pleasant

Leknes, Brooks, Wiech, and Tracey (2008) demonstrated that relief from pain itself (i.e., the lack of stimulation following the offset of pain) is a positive hedonic experience:

(1) the sudden termination of a painful sensation elicits self-reported positive affect, (2) relief increases with the intensity of pain, and 
(3) the pleasantness of relief increases with the efficacy and speed of return to homeostatic balance (i.e., when cooling of the skin facilitated relief)


opponent process theory (Solomon 1980)—requires an immediate termination of pain as contrast: pain produces subsequent pleasurable experiences that arise in response to the relief of pain. Importantly, this oppo- nent “overshoot” would be apparent only when the experi- ence of pain ends abruptly. Pain that recedes slowly (like a headache) would camouflage detection of the opponent process

(Like pain that is self-inflicted, exercise etc)

A proposed mechanism underlying the pleasurable relief from pain or threat of pain is the activation of the brain's reward circuitry (Leknes et al., 2013; Leknes et al., 2008; Leknes, Lee, Berna, Andersson, {\&} Tracey, 2011)

the brain's reward circuitry may under certain conditions be acti- vated by painful stimulation (e.g., Becerra, Breiter, Wise, Gonzalez, {\&} Borsook, 2001; Gear, Aley, {\&} Levine, 1999; Zubieta et al., 2001)

This could help to explain why people in some circumstances repeatedly seek out painful experi- ences (Fields, 2007; Roth, Ostroff, {\&} Hoffman, 1996; although see Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2013, for evidence that self-harm may not be motived in these ways). 

Pain elicits release of dopamine and endogenous opioids, which have been linked to learning, motivation, and the experience of pleasure (e.g., Leknes {\&} Tracey, 2008; Zubieta et al., 2001)

Opioid system remains activated after the cessation of pain (e.g., Sprenger et al., 2006). the ongoing release of opioids after the cessation of pain may explain why the relief of pain is pleasant.

Endogenous opioids underpin a positive shift in affect across the hedonic spectrum (i.e., decreasing pain and increasing pleasure; Leknes {\&}
Tracey, 2008)

activation of the opioid system, which may be caused by either pain or plea- sure (Smith {\&} Berridge, 2007; Zubieta et al., 2001, 2002), causes positive stimuli to be experienced as more pleasant and negative stimuli as less unpleasant

Exercise and Pain: 
The state of euphoria experienced by some people after (? during??) intense exercise, often referred to as “runner's high,” is also underpinned by endogenous opioid release. Specifically, in two studies, perceived euphoria was related to opioid release in the brain's reward system (Boecker et al., 2008), and the “runner's high” was blocked by opioid antagonist treatment (Daniel, Martin, {\&} Carter, 1992). This research demonstrates that endurance running can produce subsequent positive experiences through activation of opioid receptors

Pain is a central feature of intense aerobic exercise (O'Connor {\&} Cook, 1999) which places limits on intensity and performance (Anshel {\&} Russell, 1994; Mauger, Jones, {\&} Williams, 2010; O'Connor, 1992). It may be that nociceptive stimulation is related to the euphoric experiences arising from intense aerobic exercise.


Opioid reward system for analgesia and antinociception:
Activation of the reward system has also been linked to
the production of analgesic states (Benedetti, Mayberg, Wagner, Stohler, {\&} Zubieta, 2005; Dum {\&} Herz, 1984; Forsberg, Wiesenfeld-Hallin, Eneroth, {\&} Sodersten, 1987).

Gear and colleagues (1999) showed that sub-dermal injection of capsaicin (a skin irritant made from chilies) or paw immersion in hot water activated antinociception in rats, and this nociceptive control depended both on opioid and dopamine in the nucleus accumbens

Research on human participants also supports pain-induced analgesia
(e.g., Piche, Arsenault, {\&} Rainville, 2009). Experimentally induced pain has been shown to attenuate sensory and pain-specific affective responses through activa- tion of the opioid system (Zubieta et al., 2001; although see Gilchrist, Allard, {\&} Simone, 1996, regarding cases of sec- ondary hyperalgesia).


Physical Pain and Emotion regulation:
Disruptions in opioidergic brain activity have also been linked to sadness and depression (Kennedy, Koeppe, Young, {\&} Zubieta, 2006; Prossin et al., 2011; Zubieta et al., 2003), suggesting that physical pain may help regulate emotional pain by activating endogenous opioid release.

This is analo- gous to thrill-seeking behavior (Franken, Zijlstra, {\&} Muris, 2006), which may alleviate emotional numbness through activation of the endogenous opioid system. 

Likewise, a common motivation for the act of self-harm, which itself is known to activate the endogenous opioid system (Nock, 2010a, 2010b; Symons, Thompson, {\&} Rodriguez, 2004), is the relief of emotional numbness and regulation of negative affective states (Franklin et al., 2010; Franklin, Lee, et al. 2013; see also Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2013, for an account of how pain offset relief may regulate negative affect by commandeering shared neural substrates and thereby incidentally relieving emotional pain)

Although the reduction of emotional pain is not, strictly speaking, the same thing as the production of pleasure, relief from emotionally painful states may be pleasurable in the same ways that relief from pain has been found to be (Franklin, Lee, et al., 2013; Leknes et al., 2008).

Whether these effects may translate to pain aris- ing from other sources, such as social pain, remains an open question and suggests a fruitful future research direction. To the extent that the experience of social pain activates the endogenous opioid system (MacDonald {\&} Leary, 2005) and would provide a contrast for subsequent pleasure, it may also be linked to the production of pleasant states


Distraction is an effective emotion regulation strategy (Gross, 1998) and pain fulfills this function very effectively.

Nock (2010a, 2010b), physical pain associated with self-harm serves as a distrac- tion from emotionally distressing thoughts and feelings, thereby reducing the tendency to ruminate on these mental states

Although self-harm regulates undesirable affective states, pain in the context of self-harm is complicated by self- destructive tendencies. Thus, people sometimes replace self- harm with non-harmful but painful methods such as holding ice, snapping one's wrist with a rubber band, or intense physical exercise (Klonsky {\&} Glenn, 2008).

case evidence suggests that physical exercise may be an effective replacement behavior for self-injury (Wallenstein {\&} Nock, 2007), pre- sumably because this activity also has the capacity to regu- late undesirable affective states

bringing people's awareness into the present moment appears to be a particularly good strategy for regulating unwanted emotion states. Physical pain serves this purpose ruthlessly, capturing attention and reducing awareness of mental content.

Franklin and colleagues found that participants who were exposed to pain (cold-pres- sor task) showed increased affect regulation (startle-alone reactivity) compared to a no-pain control group. The study also provided evidence for enhanced quality of information processing in response to pain (measured as prepulse inhibi- tion, which has been associated with greater executive functioning, Bitsios {\&} Giakoumaki, 2005) in a self-harming clinical sample.





Pain heightens sensory sensitivity:
Pain is ontogenetically and evolutionarily disposed to recruit resources aimed at action and escape (Eccleston {\&} Crombez, 1999; Shackman et al., 2011). Pain increases arousal (Pfaff, 2006; Price, 2000) and awareness of the immediate physiological condition of the body (A. D. Craig, 2002, 2003, 2009)

Much like mindfulness/flow activities 

Full immersion:
pain interrupts other goal pursuits by directing attention to the immediate pain event (Crombez, Eccleston, Baeyens, {\&} Eelen, 1996; Legrain et al., 2009)

This is because the body remains in a vigilant state after pain, serving to maintain increased arousal and awareness of further physiological and environmental threat

the arousal-inducing effect of pain may serve to enhance sensory perception

Under conditions of high arousal, participants are faster to respond to goal-relevant stimuli and are better able to ignore irrelevant stimulus characteristics when asked to classify stimuli on a focal dimension (Chajut {\&} Algom, 2003; Cornsweet, 1969).

Pain's capacity to capture attention and focus awareness on the immediate physiological condition of the body can also increase sensory engagement. This effect of pain is sometimes used to increase sexual enjoyment and excite- ment (Baumeister, 1988). Work by Masters and Johnson (1970) in the area of sex therapy promotes the use of a “sen- sate focus” which involves directing attention to immediate bodily sensations. The notion that shifting awareness to bodily sensation, and away from evaluative self-awareness, increases the intensity of sensory experience is also sup- ported by the use of mindfulness-based interventions for eating disorders which, among other things, aim to increase physical sensations such as taste (Kristeller, Baer, {\&} Wolever, 2006)

Evidence suggests that the offset of acute pain enhances the capacity to savor and enjoy positive sensory experiences (Bastian, Jetten, {\&} Hornsey, 2014).
Sensititvity to taste

we would expect that these effects are
largely limited to painful experiences that are physical in nature. For example, research has provided evidence that social pain causes cognitive deconstructive states, emotional numbness, and a loss of time perception (Twenge, Catanese, {\&} Baumeister, 2003). It is unlikely that increased sensory awareness would correlate with these outcomes.


Pain facilitates pleasure seeking.

Pain and Justice: unfair pain and "guilty pleasures"
Pain is not only adverse, but is also often associated with concepts of justice and fairness. People often report feeling punished by their pain (Glucklich, 2001; Koffman, Morgan, Edmonds, Speck, {\&} Higginson, 2008), and the link between pain and punishment is evident across a range of contexts: parents spank their children, crime has historically had torturous consequences, and pain is often used as an effective negative reinforcement for behavior (Skinner, 1938)

the Latin word for pain—poena—is literally translated as “to pay the penalty.” As such, experiences of pain may also acti- vate concepts associated with punishment and justice (L. E. Williams, Huang, {\&} Bargh, 2009), and “unfair” pain may allow people to feel justified in their indulgence of “guilty pleasures.”

only “unfair” pain leads to self-indulgence 

Indeed, participants who experienced pain were more likely to take the chocolate. Furthermore, the effect was evident only for people who were especially sensitive to being the victims of injustice (i.e., high in justice sensitivity, M. Schmitt, Gollwitzer, Maes, {\&} Arbach, 2005). As such, both studies provided sup- port for the role of justice-related cognition in determining responses to pain, a response that was found to shape pain- related self-indulgent behavior.

Self-indulgence: 
In one study, participants who experienced acute pain (laser induced heat to the hand) accepted more unfair offers in an economic ultimatum game, but this occurred at the expense of altruistic punishment of unfair proposals (a response which serves to reinforce social norms for fair behavior; Mancini, Betti, Panasiti, Pavone, {\&} Aglioti, 2011)

a study on chronic pain patients whose decisions in a gambling game were motivated by maximizing immediate gains, but which resulted in larger future losses (Apkarian et al., 2004)

After an episode of social pain, participants engage in increased entitlement behaviors (Poon, Chen, {\&} DeWall, 2013), indulge in unhealthy but rewarding snacks (Twenge, Catanese, {\&} Baumeister, 2002), and focus on immediate rewards versus longer term goals (Twenge et al., 2003).

people are more responsive to immediate rewards after pain, albeit at the cost of longer term benefits

Hedonic basis of pain? 


Pain Enables Self-Regulation and Enhancement


Pain increases cognitive-affective control

Environments in which physical pain is present are commonly defined by uncertainty, substantial risk, and competing behavioral responses. 

Optimal instrumental behavior in such threatening environments requires cognitive control (J. A. Gray {\&} McNaughton, 2000; Norman {\&} Shallice, 1986).

For this reason, the primitive flight/fight response to pain requires that cognitive resources are brought on line to determine an optimal course of action

adaptive control hypothesis (Shackman et al., 2011). Drawing from observations that the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) makes a similar functional contribution to negative affect, pain, and cognitive control, Shackman and colleagues have argued that all three tend to engage the same processes to solve conceptu- ally similar problems (see also Yeung, Botvinick, {\&} Cohen, 2004). By triggering this neural system, pain therefore increases the capacity for cognitive control and behavioral inhibition (Botvinick, 2007; Cisek {\&} Kalaska, 2010)

In everyday life, people are often exposed to contexts that reduce self-regulation (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, {\&} Tice, 1998) and pain may be one avenue through which this resource can be bolstered.


Pain enables identity management:

By pulling attention to a real or potential injury site, pain grounds people within an immediate bodily awareness of themselves (cf. Nolen-Hoek- sema, Wisco, {\&} Lyubomirsky, 2008)

This effect of pain not only distracts people from emotional content, but it also reduces high-level awareness of a symbolically mediated, temporally extended identity (i.e., thoughts about oneself in the past or future).

Baumeister (1988) proposed that the practice of masochism (generally involving the experience of controlled and injury free pain) reduces the individual's high-level awareness of him- or herself, replacing this with a low-level awareness of oneself as a mere body experiencing sensations and movements.

bodily pain supersedes high-level aware- ness. In such cases, reflective awareness is temporarily unavailable, and attention is narrowed to the immediate pres- ent, both spatially and temporally

This effect of pain may allow people to “escape the self” as experienced at higher levels of awareness

pain leads people to focus on immediate, low-level aspects of themselves, thereby relieving the adverse effects of high-level self-awareness.

Pain provides a vehicle through which the individual becomes open to novel higher level represen- tations made available within the immediate context

Initiation ceremonies often involve beatings, exposure to cold, withdrawal of food and water, bodily mutilation, and flagellation (Aronson {\&} Mills, 1959; Whitehouse, 1996). van Gennep (1977) described this process as separating oneself from one's current status as a member of one group (e.g., children, lower status) and tran- sitioning to a new status as a member of a new group (e.g., adults, higher status).

By disrupting high-level awareness, painful initiation rites facilitate a shift in identity, allowing for redefinition of the self and therefore personal alignment with new roles or memberships.

As such, we would expect these benefits to arise in cases where people feel challenged, rather than threatened and traumatized, by these initiation experiences.


Pain demonstrates virtue

Enduring pain may be understood as a challenge in some contexts (Blasco- vich {\&} Tomaka, 1996), highlighting qualities of the individ- ual relevant to the particular challenge. For example, enduring pain (such as through self-flagellation) within reli- gious contexts can highlight positive spiritual qualities (Glucklich, 2001)

In sporting contexts or war, enduring pain highlights heroic or perhaps masculine qualities, and in childbirth, feminine qualities.

Morris (1991) noted that tolerance of pain fosters a per- ception that a person is noble and heroic (see also Nietzsche, 1882/1974)

Virtue revealed through the toler- ance of pain is also evident in many contemporary sporting contexts, where injured players are praised for continuing to compete regardless of their pain. Demonstrations of bravery and heroism through the tolerance of pain are often motivat- ing to others, persuading those others to join the hero's cause

Pain is a particularly visceral challenge. Overcoming pain requires that people moderate their responses to a primary defense system that has the capacity to interrupt all other goal pursuits and to overwhelm complex thought and emo- tion. Maintaining composure and alternative goal pursuits in the face of pain is a clear demonstration of self-mastery and determination

This finding is consistent with work on challenge and threat theory (Blascovich {\&} Mendes, 2010; Blascovich {\&} Tomaka, 1996) showing that when the demands of pain are experienced as a challenge, they will promote an approach-like state where people experience a sense of pride and increased self-esteem

Other work focusing on a sector of the lesbian population in China found that the tolerance of pain associated with tattoo- ing was used as evidence of “butch” or masculine qualities (Liu, Liu, {\&} Elliott, 2010)

Pain, it seems, is the embodiment of atonement. That is, pain may be understood as having the capacity to re-balance the scales of justice through processes akin to retributive jus- tice (Darley {\&} Pittman, 2003; Freud, 1916/1957)


Pain promotes affiliation:
1. Pain expression arouses empathy in others. One way in which pain may promote affiliation is through the expression of pain to others within one's immediate environment.

well documented that people express pain to facilitate assistance from others to escape threat, recover, and heal (for a review of pain communication see Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2011)

evolved a distinct and specific facial expression of pain (A. C. Williams, 2002)

Automatic and controlled expression of pain: 
Interestingly, facial expressions of pain are more easily detected by observers when the individual attempts to suppress rather than amplify or simulate their pain. This find- ing indicates that people have poor voluntary control over their expressions of pain (A. C. Williams, 2002). Even so, pain expressions can be adjusted to some degree through suppression or exaggeration (Crombez {\&} Eccleston, 2002; Larochette, Chambers, {\&} K. D. Craig, 2006), and these expressions are sensitive to the presence of others (Sullivan, Adams, {\&} Sullivan, 2004; Vervoort et al., 2008). In sho},

ones found in religions, will best proliferate when expressed by prestigious individuals performing CREDs.

Introduction

how natural selection might have shaped our cognitive processes for cultural learning so as to give salience to certain kinds of displays or actions

the implications of such cognitive processes for cultural evolution

cultural learners are potentially exploitable by manipulators who can convey one mental representation but actually believe something else, or at least misrepresent their depth of commitment to a particular belief:

natural selection addressed the emergent problem of Machiavellian manipulators, not by suppressing the use of symbolic communication in cultural learning, but by constructing a kind of cultural immune system

I propose that learners have evolved to attend to credibility enhancing displays (CREDs) along- side the verbal expressions of their models (i.e., those individuals from whom people learn)

reliable measures of the model's actual degree of commitment to (or belief in) the representations that he has inexpensively expressed symbo- lically (e.g., verbally)

Learners should use such displays in determining how much to commit to a particular culturally acquired mental representation such as an ideology, value, belief or preference. After laying this out, I summarize supporting findings from psychology.

stable cultural evolutionary states are interesting because they show how particular displays or acts, which appear costly to one who does not hold the relevant corresponding belief, can be sustained by cultural evolution

sustain costly practices that elevate the commitment of group members to beliefs that promote group benefits, larger-scale cooperation and solidarity, and — in particular—favor success in competition with other social groups (or institutions)

(e.g. rituals) that maximize participants' commitment to those beliefs.

(1) belief-practice (ritual) combina- tions are spread by cultural group selection (CGS); 

(2) participation in costly rituals is associated with prosocial in- group behavior, because costly rituals transmit commitment to group-beneficial beliefs/goals to participants;

(3) institutions requiring costly displays are favored by cultural evolution because costly displays bymembers transmit higher levels of belief commitment and thereby promote cooperation and success in intergroup or interinstitution competition

a process, initiated by an evolved learning bias, that connects costly, even extravagant, displays to cooperation and commitment to a group's beliefs and ideology (245)

(1) religions are often associated with prestigious paragons of virtue who make (or made) costly sacrifices; 
(2) martyrdom is so persuasive; 
(3) religions and rituals are loaded with sacrifices of various kinds; 
(4) gods and ancestors want costly acts; and 
(5) religious leaders often take costly vows, such as those involving poverty and celibacy

Evolution of social learning: 
how selection has shaped our cultural learning processes in order to more effectively acquire ideas, beliefs, values, preferences and practices from others in our social world:

Hypotheses
1) context (cues about a model's prestige or success) 

cognitive mechanisms, often glossed as prestige-biased transmission (Henrich {\&} Gil-White, 2001), proposes that learners use model-based cues to figure out who, among their potential models, is most likely to possess adaptive information suitable to the learner's situation

pay attention to and learn from others based on cues of 
prestige, 
success, 
skill, 
age, 
ethnicity (marked by dialect, dress, etc.) 
sex 
(Henrich {\&} Henrich, 2007: chapter 2).

Moreover, these biases appear to operate across domains of expertise, as those with skill or knowledge in one field (e.g., basketball) are granted influence in other arenas (e.g., fashion or politics). Given this, and anticipating what is to come below, a highly prestigious individual motivated by self-interest could express a degree of commitment to a belief or opinion different from her own, which—once adopted by others— could yield benefits to her and costs to the learners.



2) content of mental representations:

learners should pay particular atten- tion to and remember representations likely to contain adaptive information:
(1) fitness relevant: fitness relevant information may spark more positive or negative emotional responses, thus biasing memory storage and recall

(2) potentially actionable: readily influence subsequent actions, including additional inferences

(3) plausible or compatible:

compatibility bias: information must accord with a learner's expectations, 

based on evolved intuitions, including cognitive processes in such domains as mechanics and biology.

eg. electrons that exist only probabilistically at any point in space, violate intuitive expectations from folk mechanics and thus do not readily transmit

culturally acquired: possession of one mental representation biases the acquisition of others. That is, having acquired a particular idea via cultural transmission, a learner may be more likely to acquire another idea or practice, because the two “fit together” in some cognitive or psychological sense

dangerous animals (Barrett, 2007), 
meat taboos (Fessler, 2003), 
the disgustingness of urban legends (Heath, Bell, {\&} Sternberg, 2001) 
and gossip (Mesoudi, Whiten, {\&} Dunbar, 2006)

The the mnemonic advantages of counterintuitive representations:
presence of some counterintuitive content in concepts or narratives can bias memory in a manner that would favor such concepts or narratives in cultural evolution (Barrett {\&} Nyhof, 2001; Lisdorf, 2004):

The presence of a few counterintuitive concepts in a narrative, even within a list of otherwise ordinary concepts, improves memory for the entire narrative or list (Norenzayan, Atran, Faulkner, {\&} Schaller, 2006)

"immune system is designed to assess a potential model's “degree of belief or commitment” to a symbolically communicated belief using the model's displays or actions"

...displays that are most consistent with the expressed representation(s) and—more importantly—look for actions that would not be performed by a model believing something different from what the model expressed symbolically

E.g. Giving to Charity:

A model might express the view that donating to charity is important, but not donate when given the opportunity. 
The action, not donating, should indicate to a learner that while the model may believe in some sense that giving to charity is a good idea, he is probably not deeply committed to it.
As we will see, cultural learners under such conditions would simply acquire the practice of talking about how good it is to give to charity, without actually giving

Cultural learners are using these actions to more accurately assess the models' degree of commitment or beliefs in the expressed representation. Such diagnostic actions are credibility-enhancing displays (CREDs).


Since context and content transmission biases do not disappear in the absence of CREDs, cultural learners will still recall the verbal statements of, for example, prestigious indivi- duals better than the statements of others (Henrich {\&} Gil- White, 2001).
The key is that, in the absence of CREDs, learners are not committed to those recalled representations in a manner that propels behavior beyond simply repeating the expression itself (246)

if identical models verbally express the same belief, preference or opinion, learners should be — ceteris paribus — more likely to learn from models who perform accompanying CREDs

Food preference and consumption:

learners actually shift their intrinsic food preferences toward those of their models, especially when those models are same-sex, older children (Birch, 1980, 1987; Duncker, 1938)

Harper and Sanders (1975) report experimental findings in which a female experimenter went to the homes of children (ages 14 to 48 months), spent at least 20 min playing with the child until he or she seemed comfortable, and then presented the child with a novel food. In the baseline treatment, the experimenter merely placed the novel food out (within reach of the child) and declaratively stated “something to eat” to the child. In the CRED treatment, the experimenter said the same thing as she sampled some of the food. In the baseline, only 25{\%} of children tasted the food, while in the CRED treatment 75{\%} sampled (pb.05).

What about the variance according to age?

Opinion Transmission:
subjects shift their opinion substantially more when the model is more prestigious. This same work also shows evidence of CREDs, although in a more nuanced manner than with food.

The evidence also suggests that the influence of high-
prestige individuals is damaged more when they advocate for their own interests than when low-prestige individuals advocate for their own interests


Cultural transmission of altruism requires costly acts:

Donation: Actually donating is a CRED because it would be unlikely to be observed if the model held beliefs or preferences about charitable giving substantially dif- ferent from those he expressed verbally

Bowling Game: Experimental paradigm in developmental studies: 
2x2: Preaching (giving/selfishness) x practice (giving/selfishness):

a child is brought to the experimental area to get acquainted with the experimenter. Then, the child is introduced to a miniature bowling game and shown a range of attractive prizes that can be obtained with tokens won during the bowling game. The subject is also shown the charity jar for “poor children” where they can put some of their winnings, if they want. A model, who could be a young adult or another peer, demonstrates the game by playing 10 or 20 rounds. On winning rounds the model donates (or not, depending on the treatment) to the charity jar. After the demonstration, the model departs and the child is left alone to play the bowling game

learners seem to “switch off” unless verbal statements about what one ought to do, when and why are accompanied by a CRED (249)



Counterintuitive concepts:
need for CREDs in beliefs about intangible entities, such as God or germs (Harris {\&} Koenig, 2006; Harris, Pasquini, Duke, Asscher, {\&} Pons, 2006).

Adults in this subculture pray to God, attend rituals and tell children to pray. Adults also refuse to eat dropped food and force children to wash their hands, while expressing a concern for germs. To the learner, these are CREDs indicating adults actually hold beliefs in God and germs

Meanwhile, entities that do not inspire CREDs in adults, such as mermaids, are not strongly believed in by children

Santa Clauss: what about these ideas that have no material signs of existence? It wouldn't make sense to physically point to the existence of germs, i.e., behaviourally interact with germs, but it does make sense to act around their existence. I can't talk to God but I know he's there, etc.



Part 2: Cultural Transmission and a model for a genetically evolved reliance on CREDS

this model adds a cognitive cognitive mechanism that weighs CREDs to the usual assumption of success-biased transmission

Cultural learners, in figuring out who to learn from, consider both a model's success and whether the model's expressed belief is also supported by a CRED

coevolution of two different kinds of mental representations, a belief ($\theta$ - 0 or 1) and practice/display (x - 0 or 1).

Example: 
Suppose people with $\theta$=1 deeply believe in, and are committed to, the idea that eating high-protein vegetable foods will improve long-term health and fitness.

- Those with $\theta$=0 do not believe this or are substantially less committed to it

- those with x=1 eat lots of unpalatable high-protein tofu instead of mouth-watering steak, and those with x=0 eat mostly steak

With regard to acquiring x (deciding what to eat), individuals who believe $\theta$=1, will find the practice of eating lots of tofu (x=1) more attractive than those who believe $\theta$=0 (who experience only the bland mushy taste).

If the model expresses variants that are the same as those already possessed by the learner, the learner does not modify his mental representations. 

...if the learner and model differ, the learner changes his variants with a probability proportional to the difference in the learner's own weighting and that of the model

Models with x=1 have a success weighting in the cultural learning process of 1−c, where c is the cost of the practice x=1. 
Models with x=0 have a success weighting of 1. Since weightings must be greater than 0, we stipulate that 0≤cb1.


The effect of the CRED enters as the learner
adjusts the success weighting of the model depending on the model's observed practices (x):

(1) If the model holds the belief/practice ($\theta$/x) combinations of 1/0 or 0/1, the weight of the model is adjusted by a factor of (1−$\sigma$).

-- The parameter $\sigma$ captures a generalized skepticism
towards acquiring beliefs that are cheaply expressed symbolically

(2) If the model holds a belief/practice combination of 1/1, the weight of the model is adjusted by a factor of (1−$\sigma$+$\psi$), where 0≤1−$\sigma$+$\psi$≤1.
(3) If the model possesses a belief/practice combination of 0/0, the weight of the model is adjusted by a factor of (1−$\sigma$+$\delta$), where 0≤1−$\sigma$+$\delta$≤1

-- while $\psi$ and $\delta$ respectively capture the extra credibility evidence provided by the presence of x=1 for acquiring $\theta$=1 and for x=0 for acquiring $\theta$=0. Since x=1 is costly, we should expect $\psi${\textgreater}$\theta$

Model assumes that the learner is less skeptical about their own beliefs compared to those of models...

For the transmission of x, all individuals with x=1 will experience the same cost, c, as above, but those learners with belief $\theta$=1 will also experience an attractiveness, b, for the content of the practice x=1

giving models holding the belief/ practice combination 1/1 a weight of 1−c+b

three stable situations:
1. no-cost state, there is only one stable equilibrium point, and it occurs at ϕ=q=0, everyone believes $\theta$=0 and no one is doing the costly practice
If b≤c or $\psi$=$\delta$=0, without CREDs, costly practices do not have a stable equilibrium — we ought not to observe them in the world.

2. two simultaneously stable equilibria: (1) the no-cost equilibrium (ϕ=q=0; as above) and a costly one at which ϕ=q=1.

the critical threshold for the frequency of those that believe in $\theta$=1, ϕt.
If ϕ exceeds the ratio of the cost of the practice to the effect of the content bias (the degree to which having $\theta$=1 makes doing x=1 more attractive),

Additional work is needed on at least three fronts:

1. the model should be reconstructed using continuous traits
2. introduce an epistemic skepticism that would directly make learners less likely to accept $\theta$=1. The logic here is that beliefs (as mental representations) do not matter unless they affect actions, so all the effects on $\theta$ come in through actions
3. The model represents a content bias. There are other ways to incorporate the causal impact of holding a particular belief (like $\theta$=1) on acquiring or performing a practice or action (that could deliver a CRED):
- The practice x=1 might not be a culturally transmitted behavior but a behavioral decision evoked under rare cir- cumstances by weighing the costs and benefits of alternative outcomes.
EG: believing in God and salvation ($\theta$=1) might make one substantially more likely to martyr one's self (x=1), given the choice between renouncing God (and losing salvation) and biological death. Here performing x=1 (dying instead of renouncing) is a CRED for commitment to $\theta$=1, even though most people with this belief will not then actively seek martyrdom.

Part III: Cultural Group Selection favors interlocked belief–display combinations that increase cooperation:

showing that a reliance on CREDs can stabilize costly practices, opens the door to the possibility that such costs could be directed, in some fashion, to supply group benefits and increase group competitiveness

1. the practice (x=1) could be a cooperative or prosocial act in itself, and this could increase the success and competitiveness of the group or institution. E.g., giving alms to the poor could be a CRED for a belief in Allah and a group beneficial act
2. punishment that penalizes noncooperators (this could stabilize cooperation and similarly benefit the group)
punishment that penalizes noncooperators (this could stabilize cooperation and similarly benefit the group)
3. it is possible that the costly practice in and of itself delivers nothing to the group (scarification or tattooing) but that it elevates and stabilizes a strong commitment to a group ideology ($\theta$=1) that itself favors other group-beneficial contributions related to coop- eration in war, self-sacrifice, bravery, etc
Eg, Costly ritual sacrifices may favor the transmission of high degrees of commitment to beliefs in a lovely afterlife. Strong commitments to beliefs in God and an afterlife could permit individuals to charge an enemy, aid the sick during a plague (Stark, 1997) or help build a community member's house after a storm

Social groups with costly acts that generate CREDs for beliefs that promote in-group cooperation and out-group competitiveness can spread more effectively—via competition among cultural groups—than those that do not.

Henrich and Boyd (2001)show how culturally transmitted forms of punishment can stabilize costly norms
Panchanathan and Boyd (2004) show how reputation can stabilize costly norms by linking them to behavior in a dyadic helping game

cooperative equilibria represent only a tiny fraction of the stable states for costly behaviors, thus none of these models alone can explain the prevalence of prosocial norms or large-scale cooperation

This kind of CGS, involving competition among stable states, suffers none of the problems typically associated with application of genetic group selection to the evolution of altruism (Henrich, 2004)

the most straightforward form of CGS occurs when social groups— due to superior institutions for cooperation that create technological, military or economic advantages — drive out, eliminate or assimilate groups at alternative equilibria (Soltis, Boyd, {\&} Richerson, 1995)

"Institutions” here refers to the integrated sets of beliefs, values and practices that organize social interactions in groups

cultural learning may cause people in groups stuck at less group-beneficial equilibrium to preferentially imitate the beliefs and practices of people from groups at more group-beneficial equilibrium because they show higher payoffs (Boyd {\&} Richerson, 2002)

Empirical support for CGS:
ethnography (Atran, Medin, Ross, Lynch, Vapnarsky, Ek, et al., 2002; Soltis et al., 1995)
archeology (Bettinger {\&} Baumhoff, 1982; Flannery {\&} Marcus, 2000; Spencer {\&} Redmond, 2001; Young {\&} Bettinger, 1992)
ethno-history (Kelly, 1985; Sahlins, 1961)
and even laboratory experiments (Gurerk, Irlenbusch, {\&} Rockenbach, 2006)


CGS favors rituals that exploit evolved learning mechanisms:

annote = {postulate the existence of a nascent running spirituality in the genus Homo (Lower to Middle Pleistocene hominins, including Homo erectus, {\~{}}40kya)

endurance running featured prominently in the formation of a Homo-specific Paleolithic horizontal consciousnes

- Exercise and biophilia:
deep play, such as rock climbing, biking, hang gliding, scuba diving, and so on, is characterized by feelings of rapture and ecstasy, which ultimately create an intimate bond between the player and the environment.

...our ancestors would have developed a heightened aware-
ness of their environment that was characterized by an intimate and trusting bond that may have been the antecedent of Homo sapiens' spirituality (553)

- Exercise and neurobiological reward mechanisms:
many of the neurochemicals and brain regions stimulated during endurance running. These regions are tied into the reward pathway, a critical neurobiological component for developing and maintaining behaviors that are required for human survival and evolution.

- Exercise and spirituality:
speculate here that the existing biological reward system would have been enhanced through endurance running, driving the development of spirituality, since an expanding savanna and fluctuating climate presented Homo with a paleoenvironment that selected for running (553)

humans of all ages, both males and females, are wired, both in body and mind, to be runners.

(besides the contemporary running cultures of the Tarahumara and East African runners (specifically the Nandi of Kenya's Rift Valley), the ultra running movement today is only a pale reflection of what would have been an essential part of Homo lifeways)

What about play and children here? Is anaerobic exercise the key component that distances us from other primates, in that there is a spiritual component involved? 

Endurance Running and Homo:

Carrier (1984), Heinrich (2001), and Bramble and Lieberman (2004) that humans are uniquely constructed (as opposed to non-human primates and cursorial mammals) for endurance running

'running many kilometers over extended time periods using aerobic metabolism' (Bramble and Lieberman 2004:345)

footprints similar to those of modern humans were recently found in Kenya and dated to 1.5 million years ago (Bennett et al 2009). The footprints indicate a human-like footstrike and push-off of the big toe and the development of an arch, and according to Lieberman suggest that the owner of this foot was capable of running like modern-day humans (Joyce 2009).

Running and subsistence: scavenging and hunting
defining behavior of the evolution of Homo was the increased intake of animal-based food into their diet

- a means to increase energy availability to adapt to a more open horizontal environment (Bobe and Behrensmeyer 2004), 
- to enable locomotion over larger areas, 
- to acquire protein as fuel for an expanding brain (Shipman and Walker 1989; Milton 1999; Bunn 2001,2006).
In particular to these general ideas, Bramble {\&} Lieberman (2004) emphasised scavenging from carcases: 
endurance running developed in early Homo as a means to scavenge effectively protein-rich carcasses in an increasingly open and 'semi-arid' late Pliocene/Lower Pleistocene East African environment. 
Pickering and Bunn (2007) question if hunting and scavenging selected for endurance running in African Homo.

Horizontal Consciousness distinct from vertical spirituality
Berman (2000) defines horizontal consciousness as a peripheral or diffused sense of ego through an implicit trust in the intuitive 'laws' of nature


'Consciousness' includes exploration and cataloging of the natural environment and the establishment of an intimate environmental 'trust', elsewhere referred to as biophilia (Wilson 1984,1993; Kellert 1993,1997,2007)

This horizontal consciousness is similar to Berman's (2000) comparison of hunting and gathering awareness differentiating early Homo sapiens from a more vertical spirituality and religion best corresponding to humanity after the adoption of more sedentary lifestyles about 10,000 years ago

"defined an inclusive intimacy that would have featured no distinction between sacred and the lived present that would have characterized Homo's lifeways. In essence, running, along with physical movement patterns of play, developed into ritual infused with awareness, or heightened consciousness, that reinforced Homo's need to capture the essence of its natural resources for adapting and surviving in a changing environment" (556)

A biological artifact or legacy of running in early Homo can be found in the so-called runner's high expe- rienced by many endurance runners, from ancient Native Americans (Nabokov 1981) to contemporary ultramarathoners (556)

The Neurobiology of Play:
a discussion of running as play and corresponding effects of endorphins, monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), and endocannabinoids (556)

Work on apes produces a picture of play that spans all four play categories: motor, object, predatory, and social play—with movement patterns that intimately feature running

The importance of play in human ontogeny:
play is a critical component providing new and necessary stimulation during a critical period of rapid brain growth and develop- ment, when synapse generation and neural wiring is at its most flexible (Byers and Walker 1995; Burghart 2001, 2005; Lewis 2000; Lewis and Barton 2004

Play is also posited as training for the unexpected through 'kinemtic and emotional responses' (Spinka, Newberry, and Bekoff 2001)

Play enhances learning and stress relief, since neuronal connections increase in intensity following each play experience (Siviy 1998).

Siviy: 'dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin are involved in the various aspects of play behavior'

play behavior in its expression and frequency through the juvenile period would 'alter the future sensitivity of these [monoaminergic] systems' (1998: 235)

running and play would have been behaviorally coupled through self-expression and interactive bouts with playmates and the environment (557)

Play is also suggested to enhance the brain's ability to learn, as play can help build new neuronal connections. In this respect, play would promote creativity and ultimately provide a behavioral vehicle for increasing cognition (Siviy 1998)

social play, the more complex of play behaviors, seems to correlate well with neocortex size (Lewis 2000).

co-evolutionary relationship exists between the cerebellum and social play (Lewis and Barton 2004) specifically in primates.

Faced with a large array of environmental stimuli in such a risk-filled setting, Homo would have f ound cooperative play to be adaptive, serving to create, strengthen, and preserve social ties

play was that
running was a direct and sensuous way to develop an intimate familiarity with the landscape and its inhabitants.

Heinrich on the hunt:
movement activity in hunting important in providing a necessary 'long term vision that both rewarded us by the chase itself and that held the prize in our imagina- tion even when it was out of sight, smell and hearing' (Heinrich 2001: 178)

The neurobiology of endurance running:

The runner's high: 
'euphoric sensation experienced during running, usually unexpected, in which the runner feels a heightened sense of well-being, enhanced appreciation of nature, and transcendence of barriers of time and space' (Pargman et ah, as cited in Dietrich and McDaniel 2004:537).

In more than a few runners, this experience includes spiritual feelings and even altered states of consciousness (Ackerman 2000; Dietrich 2003; Battista 2004; Cooper 2004; Dietrich and McDaniel 2004; Colmant 2005; Jones 2006)

due to the private and ephemeral nature of the experience, rigorous experimentation about the phenomena has been lacking (559)

[The Runner's High: Illumination and Ecstasy in Motion (2004), a popular 'ethnographic' collection of runners' tales of their experience with runner's high, Ackerman's Deep Play (2000), Kotler's attempt to link surf- ing to neuroscience, West of Jesus (2006), and Cooper's Playing in the Zone (2004) create and reinforce a public construction of this emotive state]

The mechanisms: "The body releases endorphins during episodes of stress or pain. Upon release, endorphins bind to specific neural receptor sites (also the sites that exogenous opioids such as morphine bind), thereby blocking the release of neurotransmitters sending pain signals to the brain" 

There seems to be a time delay (perhaps as much as 30 minutes or more, depending on context, location, reason for exercise, and perhaps goal attainment) in endorphin release, which in recent studies has been related to blood pressure

Recent work has also established connections between monoamine release (serotonin and dopamine) and spiritual experiences (Winkelman 2000, this issue; Dietrich 2003; Dietrich and McDaniel 2004; Hamer 2004; Jones 2006; Winkelman and Baker 2008)

Extreme states of activity or stress, such as endurance running, release endorphins, but also flood the brain with mood-enhancing and performance-enhancing serotonin and dopamine

perhaps the endorphin hypothesis may not account for all biochemical inconsistencies 'between the endorphin hypothesis and the physiological and biomechanical responses to endurance exercise' (Dietrich and McDaniel 2004:536).

by running, the Lewis rat activated the same neurological circuits as those activated by drugs of abuse (Werme et al.1999) (560)

chronic running and addictive drugs increase endorphins and 'modulate turnover' of central brain monoamines (where dopamine is suggested to be the mediator of a central reward mechanism) resulting in less aggressive behavior and less 'hyperexplorative' behavior when allowed to run

Forced withdrawal from running in Lewis rats leads to aggressive behavior that is similar to forced withdrawal from addictive drugs (Kanarek et al. 1998; Mathes and Kanarek 2006)

Dopamine:
It seems that dopamine is responsible for regulating the motivational aspect of the reward system (Rhodes, Gammie, and Garland 2005).

serotonin and the endogenous opioids (Kelly and Ber- ridge 2002) are also involved in this complex reward system by regulating dopamine release and act to promote a cumulative effect on the dopamine reward pathway (560)

Endocannabinoids:

(Dietrich {\&} McDaniel 2004): Endocannabinoids moderate or reduce pain sensations for both the peripheral and central nervous systems and produce similar psychoactive effects to THC, a constituent of marijuana

effects include time distortion, enhanced euphoria, transcendence, reduced anxiety, and intense sensory perception, and for some, 'touching' the sacred or divine

enhance dopamine expression (Gardner 2005)

Raichlen et al (2008) corroborate the importance of endocan- nibinoids in the neural pathways engaged during running, and Raichlen himself has found in mice bred to run elevated amounts of endocan- nabinoids after exercise, compared to non-running mice.

Runner's High:
Jones (2006) explains runner's high as being an example of a 'mystical (mythical) state of consciousness called Absolute Unitary Being (AUB)' (2006: 39).

a 'profound experience': P Jones (2004) Ultrarunners
D'Aquila and Newberg theorize that mystical states (and there is a gradient or continuum of such states in emotive experience) are the result of either the human sympathetic ergotropic system or parasympathetic trophotropic system reaching saturation levels during 'hyperactivation' and spilling over and activating the other system.

Different kinds of movements activate each system:
Meditation or slow, rhythmic movement activates the parasympathetic system and frenzied, excitable movement activates the sympathetic nervous system

Simultaneous activation and saturation produce 'chance encounters' such as 'religious awe' or glimpses of emptiness (2006: 42)

Ratcheting up the experience to an AUB depends on achieving these maximal levels (chance encounters) repetitively and for longer durations, 'progressively reaching more expanded states of consciousness through continual reinforcement of the practices' (2006: 43)

what can be agreed upon is that endogenous neurochemicals, in the form of pain-inhibiting endorphins and a number of other neurotransmitters, are released during rhythmic and repetitive activities such as long-distance running (562)

In a typical evolutionary unfolding, as hap- pened with play, running hijacked the existing neural hardware and associated releases, and engineered the development of a Paleolithic runner's high

utilizing rats, have produced behaviors that may have underlying behavioral correlates with humans. This suggests not only antiquity for the releases but similar neural pathways, and seems also to indicate that the origins for this reward system are far back in the phylogenetic history of mammals (561)

Addiciton and conditioning via the monoamine neural pathway:

"There's nothing like your first high"

Over time, as exercise intensity increases, the number of opioid receptors on a cell's surface are reduced, therefore more running (hence activation) is needed to produce the same reward (Smith and Yancey 2003). Work by Koltyn and Umeda (2006) indicates that activation of the endogenous opioid system occurs when blood pressure is elevated during extended physical exercise, which in turn decreases the perception of pain

Emergent Biophilia:
Heinrich's suggestion of the development of a symbiotic relationship between the environment and the runner matches well with the develop- ment of a more advanced neural reward system providing interludes of experience as the runner moved through the horizontal landscape

Movement, especially intense running, would have generated emotive feelings similar to feelings of separation from ego and connection with a larger, more transcendent force that would have reinforced the need to become as knowledgeable about the workings of the ecosphere as possible.},

Conversely, immoral acts increase the appeal of physical cleansing (Zhong {\&} Liljenquist, 2006).

annote = {scaffolding as a process through which humans readily integrate incoming information with extant knowledge structures:

the structure of the developmentally earlier, primary concept is retained in the newly constructed concept.


two streams of scaffolding processes have deep, pervasive influences upon the human mind: 
1. Ontogenetic scaffolding processes occur either deliberately or automatically, during the course of infants' development. 

2. Phylogenetic scaffolding processes are built into the human cognitive architecture as a result of natural selection pressures operating during the course of hominid evolution

(From the conclusion):
Embodied cognition is an example of how scaffolding occurs in human development (ontogeny), such that priming people with fundamental sensory and perceptual experiences (e.g., physical distance cues or touch) has downstream effects on higher-order judgments. Additionally, scaffolding occurs in evolution as well (phylogenetically), where goal structures such as physical cleanliness or bodily self-protection serve as the foundation for newer, more abstract goals (cleanliness, pain, etc).



"natural tendency to obtain new information from what has previously been experienced (e.g., Fiske, 2002)
...
without involving a person's explicit intent or awareness, the mind uses perceptual, body-based information as the scaffolding for the development of abstract concepts" (3).


higher mental processes are intimately related to perceptual and motor processes, such that the mind's activities cannot be divorced from the physical, bodily context in which they occur 

mental activity is inextricably based on bodily activity. When a concept is called to mind, neural activity associated with the initial formation of that concept is simulated, and thought is based upon these simulations

Infant Development:

"in Mandler's view (1992), language itself is scaffolded onto these preverbal image-schemas; before children can understand the words ‘in' and ‘out', they must first be able to perceptually process those words' meanings via image-schemas"


Clark (1973):
humans develop an understanding that “forward is good, backward is bad” because of the nature of the human body and its perceptual apparatus. Humans' sensory and perceptual apparatus (eyes, ears, nose) are oriented almost exclusively toward the front of the body, and motor movements occur more naturally when the body moves forward. From these constraints of the human body, the notion that forward is the positive direction naturally arises because that is the direction of information gain about the uncertain environment (H. Clark, 1973)

Cognitive scaffolding: 
representational structures designed for specific functions can be used to process other information for which they were not originally designed

"structures in the mind responsible for conscious methods of goal pursuit made use of the existing (unconscious) goal pursuit structures in the brain (Bargh {\&} Morsella, 2008)"

involves not only cognitive representations but also the neural mechanisms and specific adaptive actional tendencies useful for reaching the desired end-state

--Eisenberger (2012) and physical/social pain:

Scaffolding of specific goal structures (4):

Evolutionary Problem: 
Genetic change occurs slowly over generations, but organisms themselves must react to changes in a world that operates far more quickly (e.g.,

Motivations provide the crucial link between genetic influences and adaptive behavior

"...genes can influence behavior through general and specific motivations, which are translated into the nervous system as ‘goal programs' (4)

Ernst Mayr (1976: 389): “the occurrence of goal-directed processes is perhaps the most characteristic feature of the world of living organisms.” In this way, organisms can exhibit adaptive behavior that is flexible enough to react when situations change in the blink of an eye"

What then are the foundational human motivations? 

- "human biological characteristics including sexual reproduction, safety, and bodily comforts (Baumeister, 2005; Brown, 1991) (4)

E.g.: 
the evolutionarily adaptive goal of mate selection increased the chances that a person might perceive and approach goal-facilitating stimuli such as an attractive potential partner

"...the goals and concepts that support perception and motor action are prime candidates for serving as the foundation for a fundamental set of scaffolded concepts in the human mind" (4)

Scaffolding at Work: empiricial investigation into scaffolding

Boroditsky- demonstrated that people's spatial orientations influence their understanding of temporal relations (5)

time as one of the earliest scaffolded concepts, founded upon people's early understanding of physical space (H. Clark, 1973; Lakoff {\&} Johnson, 1980

This demonstration empirically validates H. Clark's (1973) and Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) propositions that temporal concepts (which are abstract and intangible) are scaffolded onto people's perceptually-derived understanding of physical space.

Physical distance and emotional affect: 
the abstract concept of psychological distance (i.e., interpersonal, emotional) is scaffolded upon the perceptually-derived concept of physical, spatial distance.

- physical-distance cues have also been shown to influence people's feelings and affect- based judgments (Williams {\&} Bargh, 2008) (6)

Physical temperature: preference for warmth

Harlow (1958) demonstrated that macaque monkeys preferred a warm (via a 100 watt lightbulb) cloth surrogate mother to a cold wire mother, even when the wire mother was their exclusive source of sustenance (6)

Susan Fiske and her colleagues have identified warmth as being one of two central components of all of the world's stereotypes (the other being competence; Fiske et al. 2002, 2007)

recent investigations have shown that when people feel socially excluded, they also feel that their surroundings are physically colder

and report a stronger desire for warm, comforting products such as hot soup and coffee (Zhong {\&} Leonardelli, in press)

Brief exposure to physical warmth or coldness alters people's social perceptions and behaviors as well (Williams {\&} Bargh, in press)
Participants who briefly held a cup of hot coffee judged an ambiguous person as having a warmer personality (e.g., more generous, sociable, and friendly), compared to participants who held a cup of iced coffee, and people who briefly held a warm object (compared to a cold object) were more likely to choose a gift for a friend over a gift for themselves

Metaphor and goal scaffolding:

a person who has an academic success goal scaffolded on top of an athletic competition goal might then implicitly apply an understanding of a footrace (e.g., only one finish line exists, first to cross that line wins) to academics areas, such that she might be more likely to perceive fellow classmates as competitors instead of collaborators; or conceptualize academic success as a zero-sum game where only one person can 'win.'

Disgust has been implicated in both physical reactions to objects (Rozin {\&} Fallon, 1987; Haidt, McCauley, {\&} Rozin, 1994) and reactions to more abstract moral spheres (Rozin, Lowery, Haidt, {\&} Imada, 1999; Wheatley {\&} Haidt, 2005; Schnall, Haidt, Clore, {\&} Jordan, 2008).


physical cleanliness and moral purity (7):

physical cleanliness is a foundational goal which developed from human concerns with the natural environment

When people speak of moral reputations as “dirty” or of “washing away their sins,” they are doing more than merely importing terminology from physical cleanliness pursuits to describe transgressions in the moral domain; they are demonstrating how the goal of achieving moral purity (avoiding association to morally damaging events such as sins) is structured by the goal of staying physically clean (Haidt, 2007; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, {\&} Haidt, 1999).

To the extent that an understanding of physical cleanliness preceded and structures an understanding of moral purity, the way people achieve one goal should resemble their pursuit of the other.

react similarly to violations in both goal domains. Moll and colleagues (2005) found that experiences of moral disgust activated neural systems that overlapped with the neural systems implicated in physical disgust—specifically, the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices (OFC)

The actions to maintain physical cleanliness have been shown to directly affect how people pursue behaviors in the moral domain

Specifically, priming participants with the physical cleanliness goal activates the means to attaining purity in the more abstract moral domain. Research suggests that when participants are primed with core disgust, their subsequent moral judgments become more severe (Wheatley {\&} Haidt, 2005).

Further, this relationship between disgust and moral judgment became more pronounced if participants were especially sensitive to their own bodily sensations (Schnall et al., 2008), thus suggesting the direct role of bodily feedback in influencing judgments in the more abstract goal domain (see also Tetlock et al, 2000).

Core goal and scaffolded goal completion/fulfillment:
after an individual completes a goal, that goal is no longer as accessible as it was during the pursuit stage (Atkinson {\&} Birch, 1971; Forster, Liberman, {\&} Higgins, 2005; Forster, Liberman, {\&} Friedman, 2007). If scaffolding produces associative links between two desired end-states, completing a foundational goal may inadvertently mark the completion of the scaffolded goal

Zhong and Liljenquist's (2006) 
- activated participants' moral purity goals by asking them to recall a time they performed an unethical behavior; 
- Participants made to feel unsuccessful in maintaining moral purity nonconsciously increased their compensatory behaviors in the physical domain, such that cleanliness related words more readily came to mind, and cleaning products were more desirable (8)

In another study, participants who were primed with the moral purity goal were given the opportunity to complete their physical cleanliness goals by performing the motor actions of washing their hands, while some participants were not given this opportunity. Those who performed motoric cleansing behaviors turned off the moral purity goal—and were less likely to reaffirm their moral status by helping a stranger, compared to participants who had not washed their hands (8)


Social and physical pain: 

the evolved goal of bodily self-protection provides the foundation for a psychological self-protection goal:

multiple models posit associations between physical pain and social pain systems (e.g., Eisenberger, Lieberman, {\&} Williams, 2003; MacDonald {\&} Leary, 2005a, 2005b; Panksepp, 2003, 2005).

When the psychological self-protection goal is violated, people experience noncorporeal, 'psychological pain' (i.e., social loss). Protective goal-congruent behaviors that may not directly address the source of the threat are prime sources of evidence for the view that psychological protective goals are scaffolded upon the fundamental goal of maintaining self-integrity.

people who are made to feel rejected while playing a computerized ball-toss game ostensibly with other participants exhibited increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (dACC), an area also implicated in the body's pain response system (Eisenberger, Lieberman, {\&} Williams, 2003)

people who were more chronically sensitive to physical pain reported greater levels of psychological distress after being socially rejected compared to control participants (Eisenberger, Jarcho, Lieberman, {\&} Naliboff, 2006)

research suggests that priming the psychological self-protection goal (via rejection-related feedback) activates bodily self-protective means. DeWall and Baumeister (2006) measured the effects of psychological distress on physical pain sensations

The experimenters theorized that if psychological pain is tethered to the experience of physical pain, socially painful experiences might trigger the body's pain system, which would then act defensively to minimize distress from physical injury by going numb.

Participants were told they were predisposed to have a future filled with either social acceptance or loneliness, or they were not informed of any predispositions. Afterwards they put their fingers into a pressure algometer that measured their sensitivity to and tolerance for physical pain. Participants who were exposed to psychological pain via social rejection were more physically numb afterwards—less sensitive to and able to tolerate more physical pain.

Conclusions:

The subtlety of these effects of the physical environment and hardwired goals on higher-order cognition calls into question how much control human beings actually have over their mental lives},

abstract = {The impact of school-based Tae Kwon Do training on self-regulatory abilities was examined. A self-regulation framework including three domains (cognitive, affective, and physical) was presented. Children (N = 207) from kindergarten through Grade 5 were randomly assigned by homeroom class to either the intervention (martial arts) group or a comparison (traditional physical education) group. Outcomes were assessed using multidimensional, multimodal assessments. After a 3-month intervention, results indicated that the martial arts group demonstrated greater improvements than the comparison group in areas of cognitive self-regulation, affective self-regulation, prosocial behavior, classroom conduct, and performance on a mental math test. A significant Group ?? Gender interaction was found for cognitive self-regulation and classroom conduct, with boys showing greater improvements than girls. Possible explanations of this interaction as well as implications for components of martial arts training for the development of self-regulation in school-age children are discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The study of well-being is hampered by the multiplicity of approaches, but focusing on a single approach begs the question of what “well-being” really is. We analyze how well-being is defined according to the three main kinds of theories: “Liking” approaches (generally adopted by psychologists), “Wanting” approaches (predominant among economists), and “Needing” approaches (used in both public policy and psychology). We propose an integrative framework, the engine model of well-being, drawing on Seligman (Seligman, M. E. P., 2011, Flourish. New York, NY: The Free Press) and Sen's (Sen, A. K., 1999, Development as freedom. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press) emphasis on the plurality of this construct by distinguishing among (a) inputs (resources that enable well-being), (b) processes (internal states of mechanisms influencing well-being), and (c) outcomes (the intrinsically valuable behaviors that reflect the attainment of well-being). We discuss implications for research, measurement, and interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

We tested two hypotheses relating to when and why people are likely to be motivated to experience pain—that people should be more motivated to subject themselves to a painful experi- ence when they are reminded of their own immoral deeds, and that the experience of pain should reduce feelings of guilt.},

It will consider the extent to which different forms of information justify attributions of virtue, suggest a triangulation approach, and consider the prospects for a virtue-focused test of moral response. Can virtues be measured? Should they be measured? If so, in what ways and to what ends? On the face of it, the possession of virtues can be judged within limits, and taking the measure of others' virtues is so important to human social functioning that it is unavoidable and to some extent automatic and unconscious. It will be useful to note some aspects of informal, out-of- school judgments of persons' qualities, including moral virtues, before considering the prospects for conducting more formal assessments in schools.},

Using functional imaging, we assessed brain activity while volunteers experienced a painful stimulus and compared it to that elicited when they observed a signal indicating that their loved one--present in the same room--was receiving a similar pain stimulus. Bilateral anterior insula (AI), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated when subjects received pain and also by a signal that a loved one experienced pain. AI and ACC activation correlated with individual empathy scores. Activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the sensorimotor cortex (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC was specific to receiving pain. Thus, a neural response in AI and rostral ACC, activated in common for "self" and "other" conditions, suggests that the neural substrate for empathic experience does not involve the entire "pain matrix." We conclude that only that part of the pain network associated with its affective qualities, but not its sensory qualities, mediates empathy.},

abstract = {Pain is a negative emotional experience that is modulated by a variety of psychological factors through different inhibitory systems. For example, endogenous opioids and cannabinoids have been found to be involved in stress and placebo analgesia. Here we show that when the meaning of the pain experience is changed from negative to positive through verbal suggestions, the opioid and cannabinoid systems are co-activated and these, in turn, increase pain tolerance. We induced ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers, who had to tolerate the pain as long as possible. One group was informed about the aversive nature of the task, as done in any pain study. Conversely, a second group was told that the ischemia would be beneficial to the muscles, thus emphasizing the usefulness of the pain endurance task. We found that in the second group pain tolerance was significantly higher compared to the first one, and that this effect was partially blocked by the opioid antagonist naltrexone alone and by the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant alone. However, the combined administration of naltrexone and rimonabant antagonized the increased tolerance completely. Our results indicate that a positive approach to pain reduces the global pain experience through the co-activation of the opioid and cannabinoid systems. These findings may have a profound impact on clinical practice. For example, postoperative pain, which means healing, can be perceived as less unpleasant than cancer pain, which means death. Therefore, the behavioral and/or pharmacological manipulation of the meaning of pain can represent an effective approach to pain management. ?? 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

However, an influential observational study of children's moral behavior, conducted by Hartshorne, May, and colleagues in the 1920's, suggested that consistency in morality-related behavior was lower than many people expected. Some psychologists interpreted such results to mean that there was no consistency in moral behavior, and thus that there were no stable, meaningful individual differences in moral behavior – character did not exist. Recent years have witnessed a reinvigoration of character, ethics, and morality as objects of psychological study. Our purpose in this paper is to contribute to this reinvigoration by reviewing the use of the concept of “character” within psychology, considering whether the evidence supports the notion of moral character as a psychological construct, and suggesting new prospects for research on moral character.},

annote = {Algosity: moving beyond the view of pain as simply unpleasant (59)

Pain is a cultural technology...

The pain arising from your muscles can render an experience aversive, as when a headache ruins an otherwise pleasant enoughmeeting. But pain from themuscles can also tip the scales in a favourable direction, for instance adding meaning (‘I'm building new muscles')to an otherwise uninspiring gym session, or by increasing attention to other sensory signals that add to our pleasure. Sometimes people enjoy pain because we are proud of our ability to endure it. (58)

Other times we choose to experience pain that is unpleasant at the time, because we believe it will be worth it in the long run. Perhaps we will feel better for it afterwards. Perhaps other people will feel better about us when they find out what we have endured

a range of activities may involve a detectable quality of pain without rendering the overall experience aversive (58)

although there are numerous health benefits associated with pushing oneself beyond the pain threshold during endurance sports, over time these behaviours also increase the risk of injury due to strain (e.g. Verrall et al. 2006)

TISSUE DAMAGE --{\textgreater} NOCICEPTION --{\textgreater} PAIN

(pain can also occur through non-noxious stimuli)

Eg. Eating a hot curry:
Some (with preference and tolerance for it) will find it pleasurable, whereas those without the preference and tolerance will find it painful to the obliteration of pleasure...

Explanations:
1. Repeat exposure may have produced "hypoalgesia" - by reducing the number of heat sensitive nociceptors in the mouth area
2.the nociceptive signal reaches the brain, but is interpreted as non-threatening and non-painful

Mixed emotions: experiencing pleasure and pain??
pain and pleasure are mutually inhibitory: Pain reduces pleasure and reward signals decrease pain.

the opposite of pleasure is not pain, it is displeasure, aversion (60). 

"sweet {\&} sour" and "bittersweet" - combining pain and pleasure together in one experience... (60)

"We propose that pain, inmanageable quantities, may similarly integrate with other factors to form a whole that is sometimes evaluated, overall, as positive and likeable. Indeed, a bit of pain may enhance the pleasure of other sensory experiences" (60)

Function of willingly enduring pain:
1) Reconceptualizing pain from threat to challenge can give you a sense of accomplishment, partly because your choice demonstrates...(61)

- your pain experience may seem better in retrospect.

- Engaging with challenges that can be mastered and overcome is an important component of living a satisfying life. Pain represents a particularly visceral challenge (61)

- after pain, self-harmers' level of negative emotion was reduced

- "mood-boosting effect of pain" (62): relief, contrast, and the link between pain and personality traits

- Experimental studies often involve pain as a challenge and not as a threat: pain is a challenge for pain tolerance participants: there i a cultural identity component at play, "I" can handle this pain...(61)



2) positive qualities such as strength and self-control to ourselves and to others (62):

-praise you for your demonstration of strength, self-control and determination

-The perception of positive personality traits in those who stoically endure pain is not limited to others: we also value the opportunity of proving to ourselves that we possess these qualities

-tolerance of pain breeds a percep- tion that a person is noble and heroic

-Belonging to a group known for high pain tolerance is associated with social status.

Key modulators of pain in experimental settings: 
men report less pain when the experimenter is an attractive female (Levine and De Simone 1991). The professional status of the experimenter (Kallai et al. 2004).
mood (Berna et al. 2010), 
anxiety levels (Arntz et al. 1994), 
and attention (McCaul and Malott 1984;Traceyetal. 2002) (62)

-EMPATHY {\&} SOCIAL SUPPORT by expressing pain (Danziger et al. 2006;Singeretal. 2004)

Humans have evolved a distinct and specific facial expression of pain observable from infancy to old age. Easily detectable (62)


3) Because pain is generally aversive, it also represents a possibility for atonement and redemption after a transgression. These positive social effects represent an addition of resources available to meet subsequent threats. 

Pain as the embodiment of Atonement, Redemption:
-Transgressions must be paid for, redeemed, at a cost to the person responsible.

P: cleansing effect of the painful experience (63)

F1: Students who had spent ten minutes focusing on a previous immoral act endured the cold-pressor test for longer, and felt better afterwards than students in the non-guilt condition (Bastian et al. 2011).

F2: people also perceive us as less guilty when they know we have endured pain (Gray and Wegner 2010)

P: Social exclusion or loss of freedom through incarceration are other common ways that can lead to redemption in the eyes of others

level of pain or suffering necessary for atonement appears to hinge on the gravity of the transgression.

pain can be seen as a payment: "money in the bank!"

"some good things in life can only be achieved through large or long-lasting efforts" (63)

painful efforts are typically the most demanding, and undergoing these exertions is thus associated with greater subsequent benefits

NO PAIN, NO GAIN; 

Benedetti et al. 2013: Pain as a Reward
participants performed an effortful motor task. A subgroup were led to believe that the ensuing pain was a sign of achievement. Specifically, the pain was an indication that they were building up muscle tissue (Benedetti et al. 2013). The task thus closely mimicked the role pain can play in sports or fitness. Benedetti and coauthors concluded that understanding pain in this way reduced the aversiveness of the experience through co-activation of the opioid and cannabinoid systems of the brain. The effects of pain on motivation and perception of task performance were not assessed, however.

You have paid the price (pain) and therefore the results should appear (expectation)

Visible pain as key mediator of belief in placebo effect: 
Many medical treatments involve pain and discomfort, and these produce larger placebo benefits than ‘milder' non- painful treatments. For instance, placebo injections reduce pain more effec- tively than placebo pills (Moerman and Jonas 2002). (64)



4) Similarly, pain may motivate the accumulation of resources such as social support and calorie-rich foods, which can strengthen our defence systems

revealing your pain to others can elicit empathy, social support and reduce their perception of your guilt. However these benefits must be weighed against a potential loss of social status (64)

Attracting Social support (64)
- From infancy, humans learn that expressing pain leads to social support, and that social support is necessary for survival (retroactive sanctioning of crying, for example...)
- social support helps us cope with pain (Dunbar et al. 2011; Eisenberger et al. 2011; Panksepp 2005)


Indulgence in resources:
the price you paid – in pain – is what entitles you to a subsequent reward
F: (Bastian et al. 2012) participants were more likely to choose to eat sweets and chocolates after they had endured pain, effect was stronger when the pain was perceived to be unfair. 

Over time, indulging in guilty pleasures due to unfair pain may cause numerous problems for chronic pain patients, such as obesity and substance abuse.

5) Pain enhances attention to signals from the body and may thereby enhance pleasant sensations:

Pain's attention-grabbing quality can lead to enhanced senosry acuity:

F1: Bastian et al. (2014a): tastes were more intense and more pleasurable following cold-pressor test.
F2: enhanced taste perception in patients with chronic back pain (Small and Apkarian 2006).

E: could this be an explanation of the link between pain and performance in an interactional sport like rugby? Painful warm-up versus non-painful warm up? followed by performance task...




6) Pain's offset gives rise to relief, which can add a pleasant gloss to pleasures and pains alike (60)

Contrast mechanism: the relief of ending hunger, giving in to tiredness, vommitting, shitting, etc...

Relief hinges on the real or imagined existence of pain, and the pleasantness of relief is closely related to the aversive- ness of the event that has been reduced or avoided (Leknes et al. 2008).

pessimism increases the pleasantness of avoiding pain (Leknes et al. 2011)

optimism decreases relief pleasure...

"we found that relief from avoiding very intense pain was able to render pleasant the expe- rience of moderate heat pain (Leknes et al. 2013). Thepositivefeelingselicitedby safety from intense pain caused a ‘hedonic flip' of the otherwise aversive experi- ence of moderately painful heat. Participants felt the heat as painful but neverthe- less rated the overall experience as pleasant" (66). 


7)the ability of pain to inhibit other unpleasant experiences, notably itch and pain (66):

fighting fire with fire: scratching a mosquito bite, etc


The Benefits of Pain: 

What contexts allow for the "hedonic flip" from aversive to pleasant pain...? 

When we reconceptualise pain from threat to challenge or find pain meaningful in other ways

Pain's attention-grabbing ability

Pain as a social strategy of resource management: social, resource, and other forms of capital need to be accumulated and managed, and pain is a currrency in this process...

There is a balance and art to pain as a virtue: pain is part of a practical wisdom operating in a certain cultural milieu},

abstract = {Protestant Christianity has been growing very fast in China under communist rule. This article shows that the converts are not all marginalized individuals deprived of material and social resources. An increasing proportion of the converts are well-educated young people in urban China. To explain this conversion to a nontraditional religion, the micro-level factors of individual crisis, individual choices, and personal bonds are inadequate. The meso-level institutional factors of organizational strengths and competitiveness are important, but religious organizations are severely constrained by restrictive regulations in China. I argue that the macro-level contextual factors are very important to understand the phenomenon of large-scale conversion to Christianity in China today. The crucial contextualfactors are the increasingly globalized market economy under political repression. Christianity provides peace and certainty in facing wild market forces. The Christian faith is liberating amid a stifling political atmosphere. McDonald's is a prominent symbol of the globalized market, which, like Christianity, is perceived as modern and cosmopolitan within the Chinese context.},

abstract = {Over the years, these pages have featured many essays devoted to analyzing the prospects for democracy in China. Such analyses have focused on studying the resiliency (or fragility) of the current Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime, and on weighing the significance of various protest movements or other actual and potential sources within China of pressure for democratic change. Among the latter, attention has been devoted to workers, rural dwellers, the middle classes, and online activists. But very little note has been taken of what may turn out to be the biggest threat of all to the CCP's ability to maintain its control— namely, the extraordinary growth of religious belief and religious move- ments in Chinese society. Unlike liberal democracies, which generally accord their citizens the right to complete freedom of religious belief and practice, the People's Republic of China claims that it needs to control religion in order to pre- serve social harmony and economic modernization. The government has a bureau that is officially in charge of religious affairs—the State Adminis- tration for Religious Affairs (SARA). The state claims the prerogative of determining what counts as “true” and “false” religion, and uses its police power to attempt the eradication of “false” religion (often termed, in the parlance of Chinese officialdom, “evil cults” or “feudal superstition”). The state also chooses the leaders of approved religions and monitors many religious activities.},

Rejection appears to cause a significant shift toward a more negative emotional state. Typically, however, the result was an emotionally neutral state marked by low levels of both positive and negative affect. Acceptance caused a slight increase in positive mood and a moderate increase in self-esteem. Self-esteem among rejected persons was no different from neutral controls. These findings are discussed in terms of belongingness motivation, sociometer theory, affective numbing, and self-esteem defenses.},

This is because concepts of punishment and justice are embodied within the experience of pain, allowing for a sense of atonement from one's wrongdoings. Two thirds of the participants were induced to feel that their performance in a two player game was unfair. Half of those participants were then asked to engage in a physically painful task, and were afterwards less likely to make amends for past poor performance compared to players who completed a similar, but non-painful task. This effect was only evident for participants who are particularly sensitive to personal injustices and therefore sensitive to the justice restoring qualities of pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},
annote = {For some [i.e., the justice-sensitive] , engaging with physical limits, and therefore pain, through intense exercise or other forms of physical exertion provides for a sense of justice. These experiences are the embodiment of atonement, serving to rebalance our psychological scales of justice, and as such may reduce the felt need to repair for past misdeeds.




Method: 
n=69 (40 female) 
(Mean age = 18.61, SE = 0.25)
three conditions: 
1. ‘unfair- pain' (n = 25)
2. ‘unfair-no pain' (n = 23)
3. ‘fair-pain' condition (n = 21)

Proceedure: 
performance task: ostensibly with another participant:
fair/unfair outcome

Pain manipulation: 
Cold water task involving retrieving ball-bearings. Room temperature control

Repair opportunity:
allocate additional points to partner that they would receive for correct answers (1-10)

Self-report measures:
Justice sensitivity: 10 items of the Victim subscale of the Justice Sensitivity Scale, (1-6 Likert?)
sensitivity to being treated unfairly by others, e.g., ‘‘It makes me angry when I am treated worse than others''; ‘‘It bothers me when others receive something that ought to be mine''
Isn't this very much state dependent? 

Manipulation Checks:
fairness scale 
pain (1-5)


RESULTS:
-ANOVA revealed an effect of condition on pain
ratings such that pain ratings were higher in the pain conditions

- pain experienced in the context of unfair interpersonal behavior generally leads to a reduction in the will to engage in reparative action

there was no main effect of condition on added points, F(2, 66) = 0.28, p = .76. Thus, participants in the unfair-pain (M = 7.04, SE = 0.60), the unfair-no pain (M = 7.52, SE = 0.61) and the fair-pain (M = 6.91, SE = 0.64) conditions did not differ from each other in the amount of extra points they assigned to the other player 

interaction between condition and justice sensitivity on compensatory action:
In order to examine whether justice sensitivity interacted with the experience of pain we coded for a pain vs. no pain condition contrast (unfair- pain = 0, unfair no-pain = 1, fair-pain = 0). In order to compare this with whether justice sensitivity interacted with the experience of prior behavior we coded for an unfair vs. fair condition contrast (unfair-pain = 0, unfair no-pain = 0, fair-pain = 1).

a significant interaction of justice sensitivity with pain vs. no-pain (b = .42, SE = 1.23, t = 2.31, p = .02), whereas the interaction of justice sensitivity with unfair vs. fair past behavior was not significant (b = 0.31, SE = 1.15, t = 1.49, p = .14).

a significant interaction (b =-.47, SE = 1.14, p = .02, R2 = .12). Simple slopes analysis showed that for those higher in Justice Sensitivity (?1 SD from the centered mean) there was a significant effect of condition on added points (b =-.45, SE = -1.11, p = .03), however for those lower on Justice Sen- sitivity (-1 SD from the centered mean) there was no comparable effect of condition on added points (b = .27, SE = 1.10, p = .19)

pain only led to a decrease in adding points for those higher in Justice Sensitivity





physical pain provides a convenient grounding for abstract concepts of justice (Williams et al. 2009) 
and is routinely paired with punishment, given its negative reinforcement value (c.f. Skinner 1938). 

pain may be experienced as the embodiment of atonement for immoral behavior. 

physical pain may serve as psychological currency in re- balancing the scales of justice. 

Bastian et al. 2013: guilty pleasures
justice-related responses to pain are moderated by individual differences in sensitivity to personal injustice (Justice Sensitivity: Schmitt et al. 1995, 2005):
those who are sensitive to personal injustices rewarded themselves more after experiencing pain due to the feeling that they were unfairly punished (i.e., the pain was not deserved).


Discussion:
Findings show that engaging in an experience of physical pain (compared tono-pain) reduces compensatory behavior (adding fewer points) for people who are especially sensitive to personal injustice

the experience of physical pain not only influences intrapersonal processes (i.e., restoring a sense of justice within the individual; Bastian et al. 2011; Inbar et al. 2013) but has interpersonal consequences as well (i.e., pain reduces the motivation to engage in interpersonal justice restoration)

that the experience of physical pain interacts with justice-related cognition in reducing interpersonal justice motivations. This provides support for the justice restoring qualities of physical pain

it varies from previous research showing a main effect of pain on justice restoraion within the individual (i.e., resolves guilt), independent of individual orientations to justice (Bastian et al. 2011; Inbar et al. 2013). 

One reason for this may be that the justice restoration effect of pain is somewhat weaker in affecting interpersonal processes compared to intrapersonal processes.

Although the experience of pain may restore justice in any context, when it is not connected to an observable act that signals remorse, its interpersonal cur- rency may be reduced

the perception that one's behavior has been unfair leads to a preference for stronger electric shocks (which were never actually delivered) in an unrelated task. Critically, how- ever, this was only evident when the victim of that unfair behavior was present, compared to when it was not (Ne- lissen 2012).

This suggests that people view the endurance of pain as a sign of interpersonal remorse.

interpersonal effects of pain may be most evident when pain endurance is observed by others, and especially one's victims. That is, enduring public pain may not only lead people to believe they have already paid their dues, but also that others should recognize this fact, thereby serving as a public signal of remorse and reducing costly reparation behavior.

it could be argued that the Justice Sensitivity Scale is limited in its capacity to measure actual justice- related cognition.

previous research showed that people who are prone to personal injustices are preoccupied with justice and fairness in relation to their own egoistic out- comes (e.g., Mohiyeddini and Schmitt 1997; Schmitt and Do
¨rfel 1999; Schmitt and Mohiyeddini 1996)

Limitations:
we did not directly demonstrate that pain restored personal justice. As such, there may be other potential pathways, for example pain may induce negative mood and thereby reduce a willingness to repair.

But this is inconsistent with Bastian et al. (2011) who found that pain did not induce negative mood

distraction effects? Pain distracted from need to make reparations? 

We would expect that this same pattern of results would be evident even in contexts where people had not behaved unfairly, and where they therefore expe- rienced their pain, not as just punishment for past deeds, but as unjust punishment.

we would predict that unjust pain (i.e., pain experienced in the context of prior moral deeds) may reduce pro-social behavior towards others, especially when this requires sacrificing one's own personal rewards as was the case in the current study.},

Playing with a single friend and a group of friends, relative to playing alone, is more motivating, and can increase physical activity when given the option for additional time


What is the significance of the bonus 10min play, especially with regard to the solo versus dyadic and group conditions?

-Firstly, the bonus component is supposed to be a meausre of motivation (Barkley et al. 2014). 33{\%} of alone children participated, wehreas 92{\%} of dyadic and 100{\%} of group condition participated.

"These results coincide with findings from Jago et al. [8] who suggested that being physically active with friends can improve one's enjoyment of that activity and enjoyment of an activity is an essential component needed for children to maintain their physical activity" (99)

What about the (normative) ethical dynamics involved in interacting as a group? could the motivation for activity in the group conditions also be motivated by ethical dynamics? could part of the enjoyment be due to the fact that group conditions involves more ethical negotiation?

Greater numbers of people in the group allows for the generation of more physical and ethical information within the group: "more options"},

annote = {the function argument states that a creature's good is found in the excellent enactment of its natural functions. 

Because there is ample evidence for the proposition that group membership is a natural function, we must consider whether it is plausible that there are better and worse forms of group membership

the ostracism detection heuristic is very easily activated and it has a powerful effect - signs of an evolved cognititive architecture...

"The experience of pain and depressed affect is conducive to more submissive, compliant behavior, which is, in general, a good bet to reduce the chances of exclusion"

experience of social disruptions has been incorporated into the circuitry associated with the affective response to pain, meaning that emotional pain can occur without tissue damage (17)

Sommerville, Heatherton, and Kelley (2006) further localized the experience of social exclusion to the ventral ACC (17)

Norms are adaptive because they make behavioral expectations public knowledge, which makes actions such as cooperation cheaper because one can anticipate cooperation (19)

relationships and the esteem of others are vital, once again making punishment inexpensive because simply withdrawing social esteem and interaction are powerful sanctions (19)

"Social categorization is extremely ancient (at least 25 million years old), and is therefore automatic, simple, and pre-linguistic (Mahajan et al., 2011) (19)

The ubiquity and potency of group membership clarifies that the fully separate individual is an abstraction. Recognizing oneself as a group member is basic to human psychology, not an add- on to an already complete person (19)

Group Norms:
"ubiquity of norms and sanctions suggests that
this aspect of human nature is aimed at producing stable social groups capable of coordinating their activity in ways that mutually benefit group members. This is a highly desirable state of affairs for a group-living species that depends on a reliable division of labor for its success" (20)

This makes it possible for us to inquire into what the excellent expression of norms and group membership would be

The best kind of group membership would seem to include the individual having is a clearly acknowledged place in the group, an understanding of how to participate in the group well, active participation, a strong sense of fellowship with other group members, shared intentionality with other group members regarding what is important and how to pursue the group's goals, and a wholehearted endorsement of those goals. Unsurprisingly, this set of characteristics seems to describe a socially integrated, coherent life, one that has many important elements of what it means to flourish as a human being.

Kononia: communion (21)

Cooper (1980) eloquently expressed this: “only by merging one's activity and interests with those of others can the inherent fragility of any human being's interests be overcome” (p. 329). Belonging gives scope, continuity, meaning, and staying power for our activities, all of which are essential to the successful pursuit of all human goods (22)

There's no room for deceipt or bullshit:
"...one can obtain tokens of belonging such as membership cards or uniforms through instrumental actions such as purchasing or stealing them, but these artifacts are meaningless without the mutually recognized participation that constitutes belonging to a group" (23)

I do want to acknowledge, however, that happiness, health, and longevity could be construed as hedonic indicators of well-being. The richer kinds of indicators comprising eudaimonia include many characteristically human goods in addition to belonging, such as meaningful activity, purpose in life, personal growth, justice, and knowledge (Fowers, 2005, 2012). Research investigating the relationship between high quality group membership and these features of a eudaimonic life remains to be done. 


Loyalty:
When one follows group norms, one can be said to express a behavioral form of loyalty by acting in the way that demonstrates one's group membership. Loyalty is also expressed by sticking with one's group, even when the chips are down, by benefitting the group and its members, and by standing up for one's group (27)

Van Vugt {\&} Hart (2004):"group identity as social glue". 
used a social dilemma paradigm wherein participants could remain in a relatively unsuccessful group or to act as independent individuals with better prospects of monetary success. There were two conditions in the study. In one condition, they activated a sense of group membership with a minimal group paradigm. This means that the experimenters provided an artificial, temporary group identity for the participants, such as an ostensible preference for the same type of abstract art as other participants in the study

Loyalty is a virtue is a patterned practice:
problematic. One could act as a “loyal” automaton or comply with norms or expectations that are, in fact, heinous. Such behavior could not possibly qualify as virtuous action. One response to these worries is to recognize that loyalty, like all virtues, is flanked by a vice of deficiency and a vice of excess. Excessive compliance is not virtuous, it is a vice because it is a form of blind allegiance that allows one to follow any social expectation, no matter how reprehensible or ridiculous. The deficiency associated with loyalty is fickleness—the inability to remain faithful to a group when it counts. The proper degree of fidelity that constitutes loyalty is recognized through practical wisdom, through which one can recognize the good of group belonging, and the specific group norms and collaborative pursuits that foster other human goods, such as justice and social order(29)},

SETTING: Framingham Heart Study social network. PARTICIPANTS: 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. RESULTS: Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people's happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one's friends' friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 1{\%} to 57{\%}). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8{\%}, 0.2{\%} to 16{\%}), siblings who live within a mile (14{\%}, 1{\%} to 28{\%}), and next door neighbours (34{\%}, 7{\%} to 70{\%}). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation. CONCLUSIONS: People's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected.

abstract = {The quickening of interest in the virtues across multiple disciplines and the very important real-world implications of virtues have increased the urgency of developing valid and useful assessments. There have been many scattered attempts to measure various virtues, and these attempts have met with varying success (e.g., Cawley, Martin, {\&} Johnson, 2000; Peterson {\&} Seligman, 2004). I have a qualified answer to the question that animates this conference, can virtues be measured? I believe that several important developments suggest that we can be relatively optimistic that a dedicated community of scholars can measure virtue in meaningful ways if we adopt a multi-method approach. I qualify my answer because, as I hope to make plain, measuring virtue is a very complex and daunting task. The successes to date suggest, however, that it is no longer so much a question of whether virtue can be measured, but how well and for what purposes it can be measured. The time has come for a more programmatic approach to virtue assessment that can pave the way toward a fruitful science of virtue and flourishing. This presentation focuses on four major challenges for the measurement of virtue and suggests proven approaches to addressing addressing these challenges. One primary theme of the presentation is the importance of recognizing that no single study or single research method can address all of the challenges for even a single virtue. Success in virtue assessment will require the systematic effort of many researchers over an extended period of time. This project is much more likely to succeed if 2 investigators can work from a shared understanding of the concept of virtue. Collaboration among researchers in developing virtue constructs and conducting research using a variety of coordinated methods is also a key to success. This presentation will provide one possible starting point for such an endeavor, and indicate how some of the key challenges can be addressed. Inasmuch as Aristotle has been the predominant touchstone for recent work on virtue, this presentation will have an Aristotelian bent. Yet I will address virtue in a way that is substantially compatible with any eudaimonistic viewpoint (e.g., Platonic or Stoic). Eudaimonistic theories take virtues as the character strengths that make it possible for human beings to flourish (Brewer, 2009; Fowers, 2012). The value of a eudaimonistic perspective is that virtue has a specifiable and systematically important role in the good life rather than being isolated as specific traits whose desirability is limited to a presupposed, but unarticulated moral scheme.},

Eudaimonistic theories take virtues as the character strengths that make it possible for human beings to flourish (3)

There are two distinct levels of construct definition that must be considered in virtue measurement—the general construct of virtue and the elements that are specific to each virtue (4)


virtues have the following features: 
1. Virtues are enacted for the sake of some good (e.g., justice or knowledge). 
2. Virtues always show up in behavior. 
3. Virtues are accompanied by congruent emotions and motivated spontaneously.
4. Virtues are habitual and therefore consistent over time. 
5. Virtues are based on knowledge of how best to act. 
6. Practical wisdom is evident in virtues. 
7. Virtues are enacted in situations specific to the virtue (i.e., courage is important in situations involving risk).
Comprehensive
(5)


Although it is clear that not every study can encompass all of these elements of virtue, the fewer features there are in a measurement approach, the weaker the assessment of virtue will be.

It is important to conceptualize virtues in terms of the goods that they help to bring about

A research approach to the human goods can be framed in terms of goal pursuit because goals are concrete versions of a human good (e.g., the goal of a college degree can be part of the pursuit of the good of knowledge) (5).


"Is winning everything?" 

Goal pursuit accords with the ubiquity of shared intentionality, the need for a shared goal or investment before any action becomes meaningful.

five types of overall character:
1. The virtuous individual: who is able to act consistently in a way that is fitting, given the circumstances. Virtuous character is guided by a clear vision of what is good and admirable, and the individual is spontaneously motivated to act consistently in the service of those goods.
"a clear harmony between the individual's desire and what he or she sees as the proper action or duty"

This emotional harmony differentiates the virtuous character from the continent and incontinent, who live in perpetual conflict between duty and desire
This is the "click" 

Another pair of character virtues: the continent and incontinent: 
the individual knows what is admirable and good, but the individual's understanding of the best kind of action and his or her desire to follow through with admirable action are often at odds with each other. Thus, continent and incontinent individuals struggle with a conflict between duty and desire
2. The continent: The extrinsically motivated followers 
Continent individuals are those who know how to act well and decide to do so, even though this decision is contrary to their desires and involves inner conflict (6)

3. The incontinent: the cowards
Individuals who know what they should do but frequently cannot bring themselves to do it have incontinent characters. Incontinent individuals frequently feel guilt, remorse, and shame about their inability to act in the ways they think are fitting

4. The Vicious Character:
one consistently chooses to act ignobly, such as a characteristically greedy, deceitful, exploitive, or self-indulgent person. The vicious person feels entirely justified in their ignoble actions because they have a misguided sense of what is good. Vicious individuals pursue ends such as acquisitiveness, domination of others, and self- indulgence as goods in themselves. They do this by construing themselves and the world in a way that makes their actions seem appropriate and justified to them (7)

5. the beastly character:
individuals who have become
enslaved to desires or habits that suppress or destroy their basic human capacities to reason, make choices, and participate in good relationships with others. The prototype of beastliness is a drug addict whose entire being is devoted to serving the addiction.


Situations of virtues:
"A focus on the situations that call for particular virtues may be especially helpful to virtue researchers as arranging such situations experimentally or focusing on the situations in non-experimental research may prove more enlightening than less targeted studies"

Trait/Situation Issues: whether behavior is primarily
influenced by traits or situations (8)

both traits and situations are important influences (Fleeson, 2001, 2007; Molenaar {\&} Campbell, 2009). Both the institutional positions and emobodied dispositions nteract to produce behaviour. 


common arguments against the existence of virtues is that behavior is primarily situationally determined (9)

likeliest explanations for non-situationally encouraged helping are the there is simply a statistical likelihood of helping behavior among humans by nature or that there is a subset of people who have the trait of helpfulness; that is, as a matter of character


Measuring virtues as traits:
"Of course, the items can be written in such a way that they reflect stable traits, but no one-time assessment can document a trait unambiguously. True traits must show up across time and situations." (11)

EXPERIENCE SAMPLING provides a much stronger method for assessing the stability of traits across time and situations:

important in the assessment of virtues, a key feature of which is a habitual inclination to act according to the virtue that is often referred to as “second nature.” (11)

In experience sampling methods, research participants are prompted to respond to questions on at least five occasions to allow the individual assessment of change or stability of a particular time interval (Bolger {\&} Laurenceau, 2013). Experience sampling studies typically sample at least daily for one to three weeks

Why this is important:

1. ability to demonstrate the stability of a virtue over time and across situations.

2. individual is the unit of analysis, which is the appropriate unit for virtue measurement

"situationist research commits the ecological fallacy, in which group differences are interpreted as individual differences" (12)

Self-report measures and the challenge of veridicality: 
The most obvious challenge to the truth value of self-report questionnaires is the social desirability response bias. When individuals respond to questionnaire items about themselves, there is a common tendency to give the most socially desirable response (13)

1. impression management (performing to the crowd) and self-deception (genuine belief in holding a socially-deisred characteristic) (13)

2. the self-enhancing positive illusions that appear to be widespread in normal cognition: There is a great deal of evidence that normal individuals tend to see themselves in unrealistically positive ways (Fowers {\&} Lang in press) (13)

seeing oneself as having very positive attributes, being unrealistically optimistic about one's personal future, and having more control over life circumstances than is reasonably possible. These positive illusions are relatively mild and appear to contribute to individuals' psychological and physical well-being (e.g., Dufner et al., 2012; Why {\&} Yuang, 2011). To the extent that individuals have positive illusions, self-reports of virtues are likely to be inflated. 

3. Confirmation Bias:
tendency to seek, interpret, and retain information that confirms what one already believes or that one would prefer to believe (Greenwald, 1980). This process is generally conceived as an unwitting selectivity in seeking information, searching memory, and responding to memory
(When individuals think of themselves as honest or courageous, there is a tendency to recall only those actions that confirm this self-perception)...

GLOBAL SELF-REPORT:
the big problems are social desirability biases:
Five approaches to addressing impression management (the most problematic of the social desireability biases)
1. test the degree to which the scale is vulnerable to the social desirability biases by examining the relationships between the virtue scale and measures of social desirability.
2. Statistical control: influence of social desirability can be removed statistically by including measures of social desirability in studies of virtue and partialing them out of the trait measure
3. Ipsative format: choose
between responses that are comparable in terms of desirability. This is a method that addresses social desirability through item construction
4. scale items can be phrased so that they do not have the positive or negative valence that induces people high in social desirability to respond in a biased way. This has the advantage of reducing social desirability without giving up the content of the scale items B{\"{a}}ckstr{\"{o}}m, Bj{\"{o}}rklund, and Larsson (2009) dramatically reduced the relationships between impression management and measures of the Big Five Personality traits.
5. balanced the social desirability of a
virtue description with euphemism/dysphemism statements (16)

Confirmation biases will be difficult to remove from self-report indices of virtue because self-report measures are based on recall, which is the primary cognitive process where confirmation bias emerges. Similarly, distortions due to summarizing one's actions over a significant time period are inherent in self-report scales of traits.


OTHER-REPORT:
- Barranti, Hawkins, Helzer, Fleeson, and Furr (2013) found that ratings from other people (friends, family members, and co-workers) indicated some consensus on the virtue traits of fairness, compassion, honesty, and temperance. Consensus was stronger for adults in the community than for university students. In another study, Hawkins, Fancuillo, and Furr (2013) found that other-reports successfully differentiated between two people on traits of altruism and tender-mindedness
- A German language version of the Virtues in Action Inventory was correlated with peer ratings on the 24 strengths it contains (Ruch et al., 2010). The correlations of these two forms of measurement were substantial, ranging from .29 to .69, with a median of .40
- individuals reporting on their spouse's virtues: Marital Virtue Profile also predicts good relationship problem solving (Veldorale-Brogan, Lambert, Fincham, {\&} DeWall, 2012) and that marital virtues mediate the relationship between individual well-being and relationship quality (Veldorale-Brogan, Bradford, {\&} Vail, 2010)
- emains some question about the degree to which such other reports are subject to social desirability and positive illusions because research has indicated that both factors are active in relationship measurement (e.g., Fowers, Lyons, Montel, {\&} Shaked, 2001)

Other reports could also be obtained from friends, family members, co-workers, supervisors, and so forth, with increasing interpersonal distance reducing the likelihood that social desirability and positive illusions would influence the reports (18)

EXPERT RATING:
eliminate the influence of all four challenges to veridicality
would be to develop a rating system with which one could train experts in rating virtues
This method has two significant challenges, however. The development of expert rating scales and training in them are very time-consuming and difficult endeavors. In addition, the opportunity for observing individuals sufficiently to rate them on virtues would be difficult to arrange (18):
Behavioral rating scales are generally used with relatively short samples of behavior, and this practice would likely be insufficient to assess virtues

EXPERIENCE SAMPLING ASSESSMENT:
participants respond to questions about virtuous behaviors multiple times per day for nine or more days (e.g., Meindl et al., 2013).

Fleeson and his colleagues use to reduce veridicality biases is that they ask participants to respond to behavioral statements that are indicators of the virtue trait, and the descriptions typically refer only to the previous three hours. The short period of time assessed in these reports helps to reduce the problem that emerges in global self-reports: integrating and simplifying a great deal of information. Using this method, they have been able to reliably measure honesty, compassion, and fairness (Meindl et al., 2013)

EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH:
particularly by experimental conditions that instantiate the situational factors that call for the virtue (e.g., risk and courage)
honesty was assessed by providing an opportunity to cheat for financial gain (Greene {\&} Paxton, 2009). The investigators found that a significant proportion of their participants did not take the opportunity to cheat, and that the honest individuals made their decisions more quickly than those who cheated. Moreover, they found that the control network of the brain was not activated in the honest individuals, but it was in those who cheated (assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging). The fact that honest individuals responded more quickly and without apparent thought suggests that the honest responses were spontaneously motivated, one of the seven key features of virtue

Construct Validity Issues:


Content Validity:
When developing a measure of a virtue, it is important to have a panel of experts in that virtue examine the items to evaluate the content validity of the new scale. This is at least as important in virtue measurement as in any other area because the make-up of virtues is not well-established at this point

Criterion Validity:
Virtue and Eudaimonia:
eudaimonic theory suggests that virtue traits should predict the degree to which an individual experiences eudaimonia. A number of scales in The Virtues in Action Inventory correlate with eudaimonic well-being (Peterson, Ruch, Beermann, Park, {\&} Seligman, 2007):

- the Psychological Well-Being Scale (Ryff, 1989), 
- the meaning scale from the Orientations to Happiness Scale (Peterson, Park, {\&} Seligman, 2005) 
- the Eudaimonic Motivation scale (Huta {\&} Ryan, 2010), 
- Questionnaire for Eudaimonic Well-Being Scale (Waterman et al., 2010).

Convergent validity:
the degree to which a measure correlates with
measures with which it is theorized to relate.

There are many studies of pro-social behavior, including helping behavior (e.g., Eisenberg et al., 2002), and virtues should be positively related to relevant pro-social behaviors

It is also reasonable to expect virtues such as generosity, justice, and friendship to be positively related to measures of relationship quality in friendships, family relationships, and romantic relationships. Individual differences in authenticity (Wood, Linley, Maltby, Baliousis, {\&} Joseph, 2008) and moral identity (Aquino {\&} Reed, 2002) should be related to virtues as well. Virtues should also be related to hedonic well- being scales such as life satisfaction and happiness. Some virtue measures have been found to correlate with hedonic well-being scales, including the Virtues in Action scales (e.g., Park, Peterson, {\&} Seligman, 2004) and a kindness scale (Otake, Shimai, Tanaka-Matsumi, Otsui, {\&} Fredrickson, 2006)

measures that could indicate inclinations to vicious behavior, such as Machiavellianism (Christie {\&} Geis, 1970), could reasonably be expected to have negative associations with virtues, particularly with honesty and justice. (23)

Discriminant Validity: 
gauging whether they are independent from
measures of constructs with which they should be unrelated

Incremental Validity: 
the degree to which a measure captures some aspects of a phenomenon above and beyond other potential explanations for it. E.g.: measure of courage can account for risk taking above and beyond impulsiveness or thrill-seeking. One question common to many virtue traits are whether they can be shown to have incremental validity with respect to personality scales.

Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this basic finding and tested several explanations. The results suggest that high identifiers' group loyalty is better explained by an extremely positive impression of their group membership (group perception) than by a justification of previous investments in the group (self-perception) or their adherence to a nonabandonment norm (norm perception). Hence, social identity seems to act as social glue. It provides stability in groups that would otherwise collapse.},

abstract = {With an interest in origins, it is proposed that conflict within the group can be taken as a natural focus for exploring the evolutionary development of human moral communities. Morality today involves social control but also the management of conflicts within the group. It is hypothesized that early manifestations of morality involved the identification and collective suppression of behaviours likely to cause such conflict. By triangulation the mutual ancestor of humans and the two Pan species lived in pronounced social dominance hierarchies, and made largely individualized efforts to damp conflict within the group, exhibiting consolation, reconciliation, and active pacifying intervention behaviour. It is particularly the active interventions that can be linked with social control as we know it. It is proposed that when this process became collectivized, and when language permitted the definition and tracking of proscribed behaviour, full-blown morality was on its way. Because early humans lived in egalitarian bands, a likely candidate for the first behaviour to be labelled as morally deviant is not the incest taboo but bullying behaviour, of the type that egalitarian humans today universally proscribe and suppress},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights recent work evaluating the relationship between exercise, physical activity and physical and mental health. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, as well as randomized clinical trials, are included. Special attention is given to physical conditions, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease and sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, studies relating physical activity to depression and other mood states are reviewed. The studies include diverse ethnic populations, including men and women, as well as several age groups (e.g. adolescents, middle-aged and older adults). RECENT FINDINGS: Results of the studies continue to support a growing literature suggesting that exercise, physical activity and physical-activity interventions have beneficial effects across several physical and mental-health outcomes. Generally, participants engaging in regular physical activity display more desirable health outcomes across a variety of physical conditions. Similarly, participants in randomized clinical trials of physical-activity interventions show better health outcomes, including better general and health-related quality of life, better functional capacity and better mood states. SUMMARY: The studies have several implications for clinical practice and research. Most work suggests that exercise and physical activity are associated with better quality of life and health outcomes. Therefore, assessment and promotion of exercise and physical activity may be beneficial in achieving desired benefits across several populations. Several limitations were noted, particularly in research involving randomized clinical trials. These trials tend to involve limited sample sizes with short follow-up periods, thus limiting the clinical implications of the benefits associated with physical activity.},

Placebo factors have neurobiological underpinnings and actual effects on the brain and body. They are not just response biases. Other placebo responses result from less conscious processes, such as classical conditioning in the case of immune, hormonal, and respiratory functions.

No between-condition differences in power (F = 0.129, p = 0.720) or time to completion (F = 1.011, p = 0.338) were observed. Positive feedback was associated with higher glucose (F = 25.988, p {\textless} 0.01), happiness (F = 6.097, p = 0.015) and calmness (F = 4.088, p = 0.045). Positive feedback was also associate with lower oxygen uptake (F = 8.830, p = 0.004), anxiety (F = 5.207, p = 0.024), gloominess (F = 6.322, p = 0.013), sluggishness (F = 11.650, p = 0.001), downheartedness (F = 15.844, p = 0.001), effort required to regulate emotion (F = 13.798, p = 0.001), and a trend towards lower lactate production (F = 3.815, p = 0.053). Data suggest that positive emotions and reduced metabolic cost of performance were associated with positive feedback.},
annote = {Method:

Seven cyclists (Age; M = 34.14 years, SD = 7.40) vol- unteered for the study
Participants were informed that the study aimed to examine physiological and psychological responses during a 10-mile time trial,

Emotions were assessed using a 9-item measure with
items drawn from previously validated measures (Mat- thews et al. 1990; Terry et al. 2003). Emotions measured were ‘Calm', ‘Happy', ‘Energetic', ‘Gloomy', ‘Guilty', ‘Sluggish', ‘Downhearted', ‘Anxious' and ‘Angry', repre- senting a range of pleasant/unpleasant and high activation/ low activation emotions

Discussion

- No statistically significant differences in mean power or time to completion between the two conditions were observed. 

However, consistent with previous research (Beedie et al. 2006; Foad et al. 2008), different levels of false belief were associated with different physiological responses; 
positive feedback condition:
- significantly lower levels of oxygen uptake
- higher levels of blood glucose
- in which there was also a strong trend towards lower blood lactate production (p = 0.053). 
- Furthermore, self-report data indicated that false positive feedback was associated with significantly higher scores for happy and calm, with lower scores for anxious, downhearted, sluggish and gloomy, and with lower effort required to regulate emotion

- data indicates that a lower metabolic cost of movement (i.e., lower oxygen and glucose consumption,2 as well as arguably lower lactate production) was associated with positive feedback

negative feedback:
- higher levels of anxiety
- higher levels of oxygen uptake (ventilation?)
- trend to blood lactate
- more downhearted
-effort required to regulate emotion



higher levels of anxiety observed in the negative feedback condition might have also been associated with muscle tension, increased ven- tilation and heart rate (LeDoux 1998), which might reduce the overall metabolic energy available for performance, and in the case of muscle tension, require further energy to overcome.},

Among athletes reporting neg- ative emotions, ventilation increased during the middle section, whereas among athletes reporting positive emo- tions, ventilation increased shortly before completion.

Introduciton
Research indicates that the ability to control emotions is an important aspect of endurance performance (Baron et al. 2009).

During intense exercise, athletes receive ongoing feedback on how hard the exercise feels (Baron et al. 2009; Crewe et al. 2008; Eston et al. 2007; Marcora et al. 2009), and emotions provide information on how well they are performing (Baron et al. 2009).

Positive emotions associate with actual or anticipatory goal attainment, whereas neg- ative emotions associate with goal-failure (Carver and Scheier 1990).

Emotion regulation has been defined as ‘‘the process of initiating, maintaining, modulating, or changing the occurrence, intensity, or duration of internal feeling states'' (Eisenberg et al. 2000, p. 137)

Although regulating emotions is associated with desirable
outcomes, the process is proposed to be an effortful one that can involve using physiological resources such as glucose (Muraven and Baumeister 2000)

Research has demonstrated that regulating emotion uses energy and influences physiological functioning including heart rate variability and oxygen consumption (Gailliot and Baumeister 2007).

Emotion regulation in goal-directed athletes - two problems:
Downward spiral triggered by negative emotions: The first problem is that experiencing unpleasant emotions alongside fatigue could signal goal attainment is unlikely, which in turn could lead to increases in other unpleasant emotions

The cost of regulation: The second problem is that attempts to regulate emotions could deteriorate performance directly by using physiological resources required for performance.

Hypothesis: that experiencing unpleasant emotional states during performance would concurrently tax physiological resources due to unsuc-cessful regulatory efforts.

Method:
- Participants performed a 2-h (approximately 50-mile) cycle ride on a stationary cycle ergometer rig.
- The relative intensity of cycling was fixed to prevent cyclists from reducing the intensity of the ride as a strategy to regulate emotion. 
- Emotion during exercise: brunel mood scale (BRUMS: (Terry at al. 2003). The BRUMS assesses anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, tension, and vigor, hence is a derivative of the profile of mood states (McNair et al. 1971)
- Anger items include ‘‘Bad-tempered'' and ‘‘Angry'', Confusion items include ‘‘Muddled'' and ‘‘Uncertain'', Depression items include ‘‘Depressed'' and ‘‘Miserable'', Fatigue items include ‘‘Sleepy'' and ‘‘Tired'' Tension items include ‘‘Anxious'' and ‘‘Panicky'', and Vigor items include ‘‘Lively'' and ‘‘Energetic''. Items are rated on a five-point scale anchored by ‘‘not at all'' (0) and ‘‘extremely''
- The BRUMS was completed immediately before cycling, after the first hour, and again after the second hour before stopping. Partici- pants completed the BRUMS using the ‘‘How do you feel right now?'' instructional

In the latter case, the athlete would need to initiate efforts to regulate emotions. In the context of this study, and arguably competitive sport in general, participants cannot behaviourally disengage by dropping out.

Reductions in vigour and increases in fatigue are most likely index to usage and replenishment of physiological resources (Baron et al. 2009).

RESULTS:
Analysis of changes in physiological variables indicated
heart rate and ventilation increasingly significantly during cycling. A repeated measures factorial (time vs. emotion) ANOVA to assess the relationship between unpleasant emotions and changes in physiological variables indicated a significant interaction effect for increases in ventilation (F6,21 = 3.09, P = .03, Partial Eta2 = .47).

unpleasant emotions associated with a significant increase in ventilation during the middle and later stages and reduction shortly before completion

By contrast, the pleasant emotion group showed a marked increase in venti- lation before stopping. Repeated measures ANOVA results show with no significant effects for heart rate (F6,21 = 1.09, P[.05, Partial Eta2 = .11), oxygen consumption (F6,21 = 1.12, P[.05, Partial Eta2 = .13) and perceived exertion (F6,21 = 2.09, P[.05, Partial Eta2 = .21).

unpleasant emotions concurrently increased breathing rates, possibly as a behavioral strategy to maintain performance. 

Of the physiological variables assessed, venti- lation is the most readily available to change. Individuals can consciously intend to breathe deeper and/or faster if they perceive that this might help maintain performance.

The use of a physiologically based strategy to try to regulate emotions could derive from attentional biases associated with performing at lactate threshold where physiological cues pre-emanate (Rejeski 1981). 

- focus on the here and now and therefore attention to physiological cues?

As all riders completed the endurance cycling performance task, it could be argued that regulating emotion via increasing breathing rates was successful.

The implication being is riders who do not experience unpleasant emotions have something left in the tank for a final sprint finish, and in a race situation, could draw on these resources.},

abstract = {An influential book written by A. Mosso in the late nineteenth century proposed that fatigue that "at first sight might appear an imperfection of our body, is on the contrary one of its most marvelous perfections. The fatigue increasing more rapidly than the amount of work done saves us from the injury which lesser sensibility would involve for the organism" so that "muscular fatigue also is at bottom an exhaustion of the nervous system." It has taken more than a century to confirm Mosso's idea that both the brain and the muscles alter their function during exercise and that fatigue is predominantly an emotion, part of a complex regulation, the goal of which is to protect the body from harm. Mosso's ideas were supplanted in the English literature by those of A. V. Hill who believed that fatigue was the result of biochemical changes in the exercising limb muscles - "peripheral fatigue" - to which the central nervous system makes no contribution. The past decade has witnessed the growing realization that this brainless model cannot explain exercise performance. This article traces the evolution of our modern understanding of how the CNS regulates exercise specifically to insure that each exercise bout terminates whilst homeostasis is retained in all bodily systems. The brain uses the symptoms of fatigue as key regulators to insure that the exercise is completed before harm develops. These sensations of fatigue are unique to each individual and are illusionary since their generation is largely independent of the real biological state of the athlete at the time they develop. The model predicts that attempts to understand fatigue and to explain superior human athletic performance purely on the basis of the body's known physiological and metabolic responses to exercise must fail since subconscious and conscious mental decisions made by winners and losers, in both training and competition, are the ultimate determinants of both fatigue and athletic performance.},
annote = {Hill's model predicts that shortly before the termination of maximal exercise the oxygen demands of the exercising muscles exceed the (limiting) capacity of the heart to supply that oxygen.

Hill believed that the heart's capacity to pump a large volume of blood to the active skeletal muscles was the single factor determining the human's ability to perform maximal exercise since the higher the blood supply tomuscle, the greater the exercise intensity that could be achieved before the onset of anaerobiosis and fatigue.

For his model invites the really important question: if the heart's capacity to produce a maximum cardiac output indeed limits maximum exercise performance, then what limits the maximal cardiac output?

Hill's complete model theorized that maximal exercise is limited by the development of myocardial failure consequent to the development ofmyocardial ischemia. This model is“catastrophic” since it predicts that exercise is limited by a failure of homeostasis, in this case in the regulation of cardiac function

“There appear, however, to be two types of fatigue, one arising entirely within the central nervous system,the other inwhich fatigue of the muscles themselves is superaddedtothat of the nervous system”(p. 228).

Indeed the special 2008 Olympic Games edition of the influ-
ential Journal of Physiology includes the statement that: “(2) the primary distinguishing characteristic of elite endurance athletes that allows them to run fast over prolonged periods of time is a large, compliant heart with a compliant pericardium that can accommodate a lot of blood, very fast, to take maximal advan- tage of the Starling mechanism to generate a large stroke volume” (Levine, 2008, p. 31).

“(3) athletes stop exercising at
VO2 max because of severe functional alterations at the localmuscle level due to what is ultimately a limitation in convective oxygen transport, which activatesmuscle afferents leading to cessation of central motor drive and voluntary effort” (p. 31)

Problems with traditional Hill Explanation of Exercise Performance:

no role for psychological factors such as motivation and self-belief that most agree clearly play some role in human athletic performance.

athletes always show an anticipatory component to their exercise perfor- mance and that this anticipatory component can be influenced by neural mechanisms relating to motivation.

the most compelling evidence is the finding that skeletal muscle is never fully recruited during any form of exercise (Noakes and St Clair Gibson, 2004)

Yet it is now established that fatigue in all forms of exercise develops before there is complete skeletal muscle recruitment. Indeed only between 35 and 50{\%} of the active muscle mass is recruited during prolonged exercise (Tucker et al., 2004; Amann et al., 2006); during maximal exercise this increases to only about 60{\%} (Sloniger et al., 1997a,b; Albertus, 2008).

model of human exercise regulation in which human exercise perfor- mance is not limited by a failure of homeostasis in key organs like the skeletalmuscles but is rather regulated in anticipation specifi- cally to insure that no such biological failure can ever occur, at least in healthy humans. 

we have termed it the Central Gov- ernorModel tohonorA.V.Hill'soriginal concept that a“governor” ultimately protects the body from damage during maximal exercise.

As a result all forms of exercise are submaximal since there is always a reserve of motor units in the exercising limbs (Amann et al., 2006; Swart et al., 2009b; Marcora and Staiano, 2010; Ross et al.,2010) that isnever fully utilized evenduringmaximalexercise (Sloniger et al., 1997a,b; Albertus, 2008) especially when under- taken at altitude (Kayser et al., 1994;Noakes, 2009)


when exercise is open-ended,
that is when the athlete has no idea of the expected duration of the exercise bout in which he or she is participating:
This
Under these conditions athletes pace themselves conservatively through- out the exercise bout, increasing their effort only when they are certain how close they are to the finish (Swart et al., 2009a). This uncertainty is associated with a slower rate of rise of the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE).


INFORMATIONAL FEEDBACK/DECEPTION for IMPROVED PERFORMANCE:

Conscious deceptions that improve perfor- mance include using the Ramachandran mirror to observe the non-fatigued arm when working with the opposite arm (Tanaka et al., 2011), listening to music (Barwood et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2010), the provision of inaccurate infor- mation provided by a clock that runs slowly (Morton, 2009)or of the actual distance to be covered (Paterson andMarino, 2004), or of the pace of a prior performance that had been deceptively increased by 2{\%} (Stone et al., 2012), or of the true environmental conditions in which the exercise is being performed and the athlete's real core body temperature response (Castle et al., 2012).

Factors that influence performance and which are likely sensed subconsciously include the degree of arterial (Noakes andMarino, 2007)orcerebraloxygenation(Nybo and Rasmussen, 2007; Rupp and Perrey, 2008, 2009; Johnson et al., 2009; Seifert et al., 2009; Billaut et al., 2010; Rasmussen et al., 2010a,b), the size of themus- cleglycogenstores(Rauch et al., 2005; Lima-Silva et al., 2010), the extent of fluid loss or thirst (Edwards et al., 2007; Edwards and Noakes, 2009), and variables relating to the rate of heat accumula- tion (Marino et al., 2000; Tucker et al., 2004, 2006c;Morante and Brotherhood,2008; Altareki et al.,2009; Flouris and Cheung,2009; Schlader et al., 2011).

The Central Governor Model of Exercise:

A key component of the CGM is its proposal that fatigue is not a physical event but rather an emotion (St Clair Gibson et al., 2003) that is used by the brain to regulate the exercise perfor- mance (Tucker, 2009). This occurs through changes in the RPE which rise as a linear function of the percentage of the planned exercise bout that has been completed or which remains (Noakes, 2004, 2008b; Tucker, 2009) and which always reach a maximum value at the termination of any truly maximal physical effort.

To quantify their sense of effort –the effort of maintaining thework rate – theywere instructed in the use of a novel scale – the task effort and awareness (TEA) scale.

the TEA score was maximal at the end of each sprint even during the submaximal trial in which each sprint began at a lower TEA (and RPE)

Thus this study confirms that the brain uses two distinct and separate sets of fatigue symptoms to insure that homeostasis is maintained during all forms of exercise. The first set are the physical sensations induced by exercise and which are adequately captured by Borg's original RPE scale score.

RPE: These sensations rise as a lin- ear function of the exercise duration and reach a maximum value only at the point of exercise termination.Maintaining an exercise intensity that produces this linear increase in RPE produces the optimumpacing strategy

The second group of symptoms measured by the TEA quantifies the psychic effort of sustaining the effort that produces a specific RPE.

“The direct consequence of the increasing sense of effort will be an altered behavior, specifically a voluntary reduction in the exercise inten- sity. Conversely, exercise intensities that do not pose a threat to homeostatic control produce no or little sense of effort.”

“the conscious decision of whether to maintain, increase or decrease the current workload or indeed to terminate the exercise altogethermay be the outcome of a balance between motivation and affect and the sensation that is defined as the sense of effort.”

The BRAIN:

evidence for activation of the insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or medial pre- frontal regionaswell as thalamic regions inthe brain in response to increased perception of effort during exercise (Williamson et al., 2006). 


Williamson and colleagues suggest that 

- different areas in the insular cortex appear to respond to inputs from skeletalmus- cle afferents and from “central command” 

- whereas the anterior cingulate gyrus “may work in conjunction with portions of the insular cortex as a‘central commandnetwork'functioning to interpret an individual's sense of effort and then eliciting appropriate autonomic adjustments to affect cardiovascular responses”(p. 56)

Thus the brain responses to a form of pedaling exercise studied with fMRI found activation of the medial primary sensory and motor cortices, premotor cortex, supplementary area, and anterior cerebellum associated with the task (Mehta et al., 2009).

Studying brain areas involved in the decision to terminate exer- cise, Hilty et al. (2011a) found activation of the mid/anterior insular region immediately prior to the termination of fatigu- ing isometric handgrip contractions. Since this area is involved in the evaluation of other homeostatic threats, the authors sug- gest that activation of this brain region may alert the organism to “urgent homeostatic imbalances.”

More recently the same group (Hilty et al., 2011b) found evidence for increased communi- cation between the mid/anterior insular and the motor cortex during fatiguing exercise indicating “a fatigue-induced increase in communication between these regions” (p. 6).

They propose that the mid/anterior insular region “might not only integrate and evaluate sensory information from the periphery, but also be in direct communication with the motor cortex” (p. 1).

Studying the response of trained athletes and untrained volunteers to an aversive activity, Paulus et al. (2011) reported “profound” activation of the right and left insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate gyrus in response to the unpleasant task.

But trained athletes showed an attenuated response of the right insular cortex compared to non-athletes suggesting that attenuating the right insular cortex response may be an important adaptation favoring superior athletic performance.

Summarizing the current evidence Tanaka and Watanabe (2012) have proposed that physical fatigue is regulated by the bal- ance between inhibitory and facilitatory influences on the motor cortex.

Thus “sensory input fromthe peripheral system to the pri- mary motor cortex (M1) decreases the motor output (supraspinal fatigue), and a neural pathway that interconnects the spinal cord, thalamus (TH), secondary somatosensory cortex, medial insular cortex, posterior insular cortex, ACC, premotor (PM) area, sup- plementary motor area (SMA), and M1 constitutes the inhibition system. 

In contrast, a facilitation system ... that interconnects the limbic system, basal ganglia (BG), TH, orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, ACC, PM, SMA, and M1 constitutes the facili- tation system and a motivational input to this facilitation system enhances SMA and then M1 to increase the motor output to the peripheral system”

According to this model, the winning athlete is the one whose
illusionary symptoms interfere the least with the actual per- formance – in much the same way that the most successful golfer is the one who does not consciously think when playing any shot.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between trait emotional intelligence and emotional state changes over the course of an ultra-endurance foot race covering a route of approximately 175 miles (282. km) and held in set stages over six days. Design A repeated measures field design that sought to maintain ecological validity was used. Trait emotional intelligence was defined as a relatively stable concept that should predict adaptive emotional states experienced over the duration of the race and therefore associate with pleasant emotions during a 6-stage endurance event. Method Thirty-four runners completed a self-report measure of trait emotional intelligence before the event started. Participants reported emotional states before and after each of the six races. Results Repeated measures ANOVA results showed significant variations in emotions over time and a main effect for trait emotional intelligence. Runners high in self-report trait emotional intelligence also reported higher pleasant and lower unpleasant emotions than runners low in trait emotional intelligence. Conclusions Findings lend support to the notion that trait emotional intelligence associates with adaptive psychological states, suggesting that it may be a key individual difference that explains why some athletes respond to repeated bouts of hard exercise better than others. Future research should test the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance trait emotional intelligence and examine the attendant impact on emotional responses to intense exercise during multi-stage events. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Can physiological concentrations of metabolite combinations evoke sensations of fatigue and pain when injected into skeletal muscle? If so, what sensations are evoked? What is the main finding and its importance? Low concentrations of protons, lactate and ATP evoked sensations related to fatigue. Higher concentrations of these metabolites evoked pain. Single metabolites evoked no sensations. This suggests that the combination of an ASIC receptor and a purinergic P2X receptor is required for signalling fatigue and pain. The results also suggest that two types of sensory neurons encode metabolites; one detects low concentrations of metabolites and signals sensations of fatigue, whereas the other detects higher levels of metabolites and signals ache and hot. The perception of fatigue is common in many disease states; however, the mechanisms of sensory muscle fatigue are not understood. In mice, rats and cats, muscle afferents signal metabolite production in skeletal muscle using a complex of ASIC, P2X and TRPV1 receptors. Endogenous muscle agonists for these receptors are combinations of protons, lactate and ATP. Here we applied physiological concentrations of these agonists to muscle interstitium in human subjects to determine whether this combination could activate sensations and, if so, to determine how the subjects described these sensations. Ten volunteers received infusions (0.2 ml over 30 s) containing protons, lactate and ATP under the fascia of a thumb muscle, abductor pollicis brevis. Infusion of individual metabolites at maximal amounts evoked no fatigue or pain. Metabolite combinations found in resting muscles (pH 7.4 + 300 nm ATP + 1 mm lactate) also evoked no sensation. The infusion of a metabolite combination found in muscle during moderate endurance exercise (pH 7.3 + 400 nm ATP + 5 mm lactate) produced significant fatigue sensations. Infusion of a metabolite combination associated with vigorous exercise (pH 7.2 + 500 nm ATP + 10 mm lactate) produced stronger sensations of fatigue and some ache. Higher levels of metabolites (as found with ischaemic exercise) caused more ache but no additional fatigue sensation. Thus, in a dose-dependent manner, intramuscular infusion of combinations of protons, lactate and ATP leads to fatigue sensation and eventually pain, probably through activation of ASIC, P2X and TRPV1 receptors. This is the first demonstration in humans that metabolites normally produced by exercise act in combination to activate sensory neurons that signal sensations of fatigue and muscle pain.},

One of the central themes of the Guodian corpus is the disanalogy between spontaneous, natural familial relationships and artificial political relationships. This is problematic because, like many early Chinese texts, the Guodian corpus believes that political relationships must come to be characterized by unselfconsciousness and spontaneity if social order is to prevail. This tension will be compared to my earlier work on the “paradox of wu-wei (effortless action),” and the Guodian corpus' “solution” to the problem of teaching spontaneity—drawing upon the transformative power of music—will be placed within the landscape of early “Confucian” and “Daoist” theories concerning human nature and self-cultivation.},

abstract = {This article argues that strong versions of the situationist critique of virtue ethics are empirically and conceptually unfounded, as well as that, even if one accepts that the predictive power of character may be limited, this is not a fatal problem for early Confucian virtue ethics. Early Confucianism has explicit strategies for strengthening and expanding character traits over time, as well as for managing a variety of situational forces. The article concludes by suggesting that Confucian virtue ethics represents a more em- pirically responsible model of ethics than those currently dominant in West- ern philosophy.},
annote = {past decade or two that a new movement emphasizing “empiri- cally responsible” philosophy has begun gaining momentum

evidence about the nature of human cognition emerging from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, neuroscience, so- cial psychology, and primatology calls into question the psychological plausibility of the “cognitive control” models of ethics—deontology and utilitarianism—that have dominated recent Western ethical thought

unlike deontology and utilitarianism—emphasizes the ethical importance of social roles, emotions, habits, and imaginative extension: 

People do have the natural capacity to jump (over the bar), i.e., virtues do exist... deliberate training then boosts this natural capacity through training, and "lowers the bar several notches by means of situational controls" (393)

“the classic assumption of high cross-situational consistency in trait- relevant behavior,” and his current position is that individual consis- tency in “character” consists of a relatively stable “signature” of quite narrow “if... then...” dispositional tendencies, such as the tendency of a given child to be verbally aggressive when chastised by an adult on the playground but unaggressive when approached by a peer


The need for longitudinal multivariate analysis:
"the extent to which a clear correlation between character traits and behavior may only begin to emerge over repeated observations over a long period of time" (394)


"few now would dispute that the Big five traits:
openness, 
conscientiousness, 
extraversion, 
agreeableness, and 
neuroticism
are “real” in the sense that they are stable over time, although they are not entirely unalter- able or context insensitive" (396)

they appear to have a considerable genetic component; and they predict substantive life outcomes, such as mor- tality, health, marital satisfaction, divorce, and occupational success

Mischel's groundbreaking 1968 work was that the cor- relation between broad personality traits (such as “conscientious- ness”) and behavior and also within broad personality traits (such as “honesty”) across a variety of trait-relevant situations never seems to exceed 0.3 in any given observation - "the personality coefficient"

0.3–0.4 correlation is enough to predict dichotomous outcomes 65–75 percent of the time (398)

quite small correlation effects can have very significant practical implications

"Antiglobalist critique"
philosophical bite of the “antiglobalist” critique derives from the claim that “local” traits, whose existence no one would dispute, are not really traits at all (i.e., as Harman puts it, that “narrow dispositions do not count”) or that they are so ethically and evaluatively “fragmented” that they cannot perform any of the conceptual lifting that virtue ethics would require of them (398).

the “local” versus “global” distinction is simply not tenable because any truly “local” trait would not be a “trait” at all but merely a single occurrence

Looked at in contrast to a truly one-off re- port of behavior, local traits are already quite broad in their predictive claims. Anything that we can call a “trait” or a “disposition” is already more or less global or broad, which seriously undermines the blanket dismissal of “local traits” or “narrow dispositions” as ethically irrelevant (399)

the degree of locality or globality “counts” fundamentally depends on one's pragmatic needs: the range of behavior one is interested in making predictions about and the degree of predictive reliability one feels comfortable with

over time, correlations in the 0.2–0.3 range are extremely significant, and we would expect that people interested in extrapolating from one behavioral tendency to another related one would latch onto such significant connections and invent labels for them (401)

traditional virtue terms, such as ‘honesty' or ‘bravery', were actually used in a relatively narrow context when compared to their modern folk usage (402)


Example: 信
the scope of xin is confined to a gentleman's professional behavior toward his colleagues, superiors, and/or inferiors, and the idea that it should also encompass an elite male's sexual fidelity to his wives and concubines would have been incomprehen- sible to the early Chinese

I suspect that this is also true of virtue terms derived from Aristotle or later Western virtue ethicists, although I am not qualified to assert this with any confidence (402)

a small set of virtue words inherited from traditional, highly structured societies are now arguably being asked to bear too much weight in the sort of unstructured, complex environments that characterize modern life in the industrialized world (402)

The core claim of the situationist critique—what we might call the “high bar” argu- ment—is that virtue ethics demands a correlation between virtue pos- session and actual behavior of close to 1.0 and that anything short of that is a fatal problem (403)

Early Confucianism and Virue Ethics:

early Confucians had a much weaker notion of the virtues than, say, Aristotle, and that the “high bar” argument therefore simply does not apply to them...

This internal moral autonomy is per- haps best expressed in Confucius's famous declaration that he could go and live among the Eastern barbarians and not only maintain his moral perfection but in fact transform his social environment through his moral influence 

It would thus seem that the early Confucian notion of virtue—like the Aristotelian and modern folk notion—is of a more or less 100-percent-reliable, environmentally im- permeable character trait, which would mean that it faces the same “high bar” challenge posed by the situationist critique (403)

education gets them over this hurdle

emphasis on intensive, life-long, highly regimented training gives them a higher jump, as it were: the virtues that they ask the gentleman to rely upon are not untutored natural gifts but rather intensively cul- tivated dispositions, which can be expected to be much more reliable than the traits typically studied by social psychologists.

Perhaps this is why athletes are more predicatble and docile than non-athletes? becuase their ethics are virtues emobided, made permanent dispositions? 

the manner in which they continuously bolster these cultivated traits with a host of situational buffers—ranging from strict social regula- tions to careful modulation of one's physical and interpersonal envi- ronment—effectively lowers the bar several notches (404)

Moral Training {\&} Disposoitional Extension (404): 

Explanation of Hartshorne and May's study (on children and honesty): that perhaps this is because they are children and have not yet learned to integrate these local traits into a broad and reliable disposition.

local traits remain ethically frag- mented only to the extent that they remain untutored

one way to understand this training is that it involves the extension and integra- tion of ethically related, but naturally fragmented, local traits.

Snow (1999): “it is possible, with effort, to inhibit and control negative traits and cultivate and extend desired ones,” which means that “though our virtues might start out by being local, they need not remain so.”

process of modifying or extending, under the guidance of an expert, various naturally given, but overly local, traits is in fact precisely the central strategy of early Confucian moral education (406).},

The resulting interpretation focuses attention on the religious aspects of Confucianism and accounts for aspects of the text that are otherwise difficult to explain.

It is argued that the contemporary theory of metaphor provides scholars with an exciting new theoretical grounding for the study of comparative thought, as well as a concrete methodology for undertaking the comparative project. What is seen when the Zhuangzi is examined from the perspective of metaphor theory is that conceptions of the self portrayed in this text are based on a relatively small set of interrelated conceptual metaphors, and that the metaphysics built into the Zhuangzi's classical Chinese metaphors resonates strongly with the (mostly unconscious) metaphysical assumptions built into the metaphors of modern American English. This should not be surprising, considering the claims of contemporary cognitive linguists that the metaphoric schemas making up the foundation of human abstract conceptual life are not arbitrarily created ex nihilo, but rather emerge from common embodied experience and are conceptual, rather than merely linguistic, in nature.},

Participants completed self-report measures of their typical degrees of eudaimonic and hedonic motivation. We then asked their friends and relatives to tell us how the participant affected their well-being. When entering eudaimonia and hedonia simultaneously as predictors of close other well-being in multiple regressions, only eudaimonia related positively to the well-being of close others. Thus, eudaimonia had a positive, not negative, impact on other people. Furthermore, while past research shows that both eudaimonic and hedonic motives benefit personal well-being, this study suggests that eudaimonic motivation has more positive influences on close others},

A large survey revealed multiple differing predictors of happiness (controlling for meaning) and meaningfulness (controlling for happiness). Satisfying one's needs and wants increased happiness but was largely irrelevant to meaningfulness. Happiness was largely present oriented, whereas meaningfulness involves integrating past, present, and future. For example, thinking about future and past was associated with high meaningfulness but low happiness. Happiness was linked to being a taker rather than a giver, whereas meaningfulness went with being a giver rather than a taker. Higher levels of worry, stress, and anxiety were linked to higher meaningfulness but lower happiness. Concerns with personal identity and expressing the self contributed to meaning but not happiness. We offer brief composite sketches of the unhappy but meaningful life and of the happy but meaningless life.},
annote = {Happiness (basic needs) are natural, meaning is cultural

so what about the happiness of meaning; the need for meaning?

Aim: to differentiate meaning from happiness

Method: 
n=397 (68{\%} Female, 18-78 yrs, M=35.5, 48{\%} were parents)
Three surveys (T1-baseline, T2 (one week later), T3 (three weeks later))

Survey questions were then corellated to meausres of happiness and meaningfulness at each time point:

Happiness was measured at each point with three items:
‘In general I consider myself happy;'‘tak- ing all things together, I feel I am happy;'‘compared to most of my peers, I consider myself happy.'

Meaningfulness was also measured:
‘In general I consider my life to be meaningful;'‘compared to most of my peers, my life is meaningful;' and ‘taking all things together, I feel my life is meaningful.'

The authors sought to identify pairs opposite findings: "such as a variable that correlated sig- nificantly positively with happiness but significantly neg- atively with meaningfulness" (507)





Results: (to be taken with a pinch of salt as investigational and preliminary, possibility of ostensibly significant relationships which have emerged by chance).

1. Happiness and meaningfulness were substantially and positively intercorrelated: the correlations in the two surveys were 0.63 and 0.70 (508)

Basic needs and wants: 
2. Life diffifulty was linked to lower happiness; finding one's life easy or difficult is a matter of happiness and not of meaning.
But, Considering life a struggle was negatively correlated with happiness but approached a significant positive relationship with meaningfulness (consistent with the view that some people live highly meaningful but not very pleasant lives, perhaps because their meaningful activities require strenuous and unpleasant activities) (508)

3. Good health: How healthy people considered themselves to be was a positive contributor to happiness, but it was irrelevant to meaningfulness

4. Good and bad feelings related to happiness, not meaning. aggregate good feelings, aggregate happiness. supports the theory of happiness as "affect balance" 

5. Feeling bored: -ve corellation with both happiness and meaning

6. Money (can't buy me love!): a "product of culture rather than nature, but
people use money to satisfy many of their most basic and natural desires" (509). Less relevant to meaning. "monetary scarcity was 20 times more detrimental to happiness (5{\%}) than to meaning (0.25{\%})" (509)

‘balancing finances reflects me' was completely irrelevant to happiness but significantly related to meaningfulness. (...it involves integrating past, present, and future actions and obligations, possibly also planning and strategizing, and therefore, it may be much more relevant to meaning than happiness.)

7. activities that "reflect me": majority of these were highly relevant to meaningfulness and not happiness.

8. Past, present, and future, and temporal integration:
The more time people reported having devoted to
thinking about the past and future, the more meaningful their lives were – and the less happy.
"The more thinking, the less happiness..."
the more people reported imagining the future, the more meaningful their lives were, but the less happy
In contrast, the more time people reported thinking about the present, the happier they were, although this was weak and only marginally significant at p = 0.07.

2nd (experimental) Study on time-span: confirmed hypothesis that focus on future and being long-term oriented were more strongly associated with meaning thatn with happiness. In contrast, being short-term oriented went with happiness more than meaning (510). 

10. Social engagement: happy and meaningful

- Belongingness: related to happiness and meaningfulness
most people's reports on what makes their lives meaningful feature relationships with family and friends
happiness and meaningfulness are quite similar: Both benefit from a strong social network and both suffer when the person is isolated or socially deprived
People with more meaningful lives also agreed that ‘relationships are more important than achievements' and that item was unre- lated to happiness, though it was in the same positive direction and therefore the item did not meet our criteria for inclusion (511).

Happiness: receiving from others
Meaning: giving to others (helping others in need, taking care of children (for parents)),

The "parenthood paradox": want to be happy, want to become parents, but parenthood reduces happiness: but gains in meaningfulness offset reductions in happiness... 

people will pursue meaningfulness even at the expense of happiness.

11. Meaningful Involvement:
"serious involvement with things beyond oneself and one's pleasures promotes meaningfulness, often to the detriment of happiness" (512)

"Big picture events" positively corellated with meaning" (512): how many negative and how many positive events have happened in your life? 

Having more positive events contributed to higher happiness, though the effect was considerably smaller than the effect of negative events (3.24 vs. 14.44{\%} of variance).
- bad was stronger than good.

experiencing many bad events is linked to high levels of meaningfulness but low happiness:

Stress, Anxiousness, {\&} Worrying - all future-oriented emotions

The stress of meaningful yet difficult undertakings:
corellation between stress and meanignfulness:
"Meaningfulness connects present to future, and the link between stress and meaningfulness is consistent with that conclusion" (512)

People with very meaningful lives worry more and have more stress than people with less meaningful lives

Expecting to do a lot of deep thinking was positively correlated with meaningfulness, but negatively with happiness.


Self
Considering issues of personal iden- tity as important was positively related to meaning, but it trended toward a negative relation to happiness

Concern with issues of identity presumably indicates directing effort at constructing the self and such issues may especially arise during difficult times, which might account for any negativity toward happiness (513)

caring about how one's self is defined within the society is part of having a meaningful life:

Activities that "reflect-me":
A possible reason for these findings is that expressing the self increases the sense of knowing one's so-called true self, and such knowledge has been linked to higher meaning- fulness in life

Higher meaning but lower happiness: 
- taking care of children, 
- buying gifts for others, 
- watching television, 
- worrying, 
- arguing. 

activities were regarded as more meaningful to the extent that the people felt they could be themselves (in colloquial phrase) while performing them (MacGregor and Little 1998)

SELF-REGULATION: maintaining one's place in society by living up to its standards (514)

Wisdom: understanding what is true and real
Creatvity: seeing beyond what is real to what is possible.

Creativity thus requires (practical) wisdom as its foundation! 

Anxiety:
If one is involved in a long- term activity that has occupied past efforts and demands more in the present to work toward an uncertain but appealing future outcome, the possibility of failure is substantial, and this may increase anxiety (514).

anxiety has a temporal structure that links the present to the future

Baumeister and Tice (1990) concluded that there are two main sources of anxiety, the larger one being social exclusion, and the lesser one being fears of death and injury 


Discussion of results:

"...happiness is rooted in nature and in the motivational patterns instilled by nature. People are happy when they get what they want. Meaning is to be found elsewhere." (509)

Stability of happiness across time, even years! (Costa et al. 1987) (510),

...the more time people spent thinking about past and future, the more meaningful their lives were, and the less happy they were

Recognizing links from the present to past and future would seemingly be helpful for success at meaningful enterprises, including education, career, and long-lasting intimate relationships (510)

Resilience: 
Past misfortunes reduce present happiness, but they are linked to higher meaningfulness – perhaps because people cope with them by finding meaning (515)



Theory:

Meaningfulness may be considerably more complex than happiness, because it requires interpretive construction of circumstances across time according to abstract values and other culturally mediated ideas (505)

Happiness: subjective well-being
-affect balance: an aggregate of how one feels at different moments
-life satisfaction: goes beyond momentary feelings to invoke integrative, evaluative assessment of one's life as a whole.

Meaning: Meaning can be a purely symbolic or linguistic reality, as in the meaning of a word. The question of life's meaning thus applies symbolic ideas to a biological reality (506)

both a cognitive and an emotional assessment of whether one's life has purpose and value (506)

Global happiness therefore may depend on whether they generally get what they want and need (506)

meaning itself is not personal but rather cultural. It is like a large map or web, gradually filled in by the cooperative work of countless generations (506)

TIME: meaning is not limited to the immediately present stimulus environment 

allows people to think about past, future, and spatially distant realities (and indeed even possibilities) 

meaning can integrate events across time

Purpose, one important component of meaningfulness, entails that present events draw meaning from future ones.

future outcome is highly desirable even though the present activities may be unpleasant.

Meaningfulness may therefore often involve understanding one's life beyond the here and now, integrating future and past. In contrast, happiness, as a subjective feeling state, exists essentially in the present moment

Vallacher and Wegner (1985, 1987) found that higher levels of meaning were consistently marked by longer time frames. 

life is in constant change but strives for stability, and meaning is an important tool for imposing stability on the flux of life (Baumeister 1991).

culturally man- dated meanings such as marriage define the relationship as something constant and stable (506)

A wedding: a "life-long commitment to love" or "saying some words in a church"


the pursuit of goals and fulfillments through ongoing involvements and activities that are in- terlinked but spread across time may be central to meaningfulness (507)

Meaningfulness would be far more broadly related to what activities express and reflect the symbolic self, some of which would involve contributing to the welfare of others (individually or in general) or other culturally valued activities},

Between 1921 and 1937, Allport was among the leading figures in the movement to establish personality as a research category in American psychology. Far from being a strictly scientific concern, Allport's project was deeply embedded in the cultural politics of the age. Of particular importance was the gradual erosion of the language of character and the self-sacrificing, morally grounded self that it supported. Allport's "psychology of personality" helped fuel this trend while simultaneously attempting to resist it. His experience illustrates the elasticity and moral ambiguity of the newly emerging category of personality.},

annote = {The review:
Highlights early studies demonstrating: "relations between neural systems associated with valuation, conflict detection and social influence, between neural systems implicated in integrating value signals with respect to one's own motivations and behavior change, and between neural systems associated with mentalizing and successful influence over others" (4)


Social influence is omnipresent, 
- implicit observation of cultural norms
- face-to-face and mediated interpersonal communication, 
- mass mediated communication

P: function of compliance and conformity is to maintain group harmony 
(but for who?)

Conformity/compliance would involve the ability to detect (consciously or unconsciously) conflicts between one's current behaviour, preference or choice, and those of others (1).

The perception of being misaligned with others may elicit distress, which can motivate behavioral and attitudinal adjustments to realign with the group (1).

conformity may be enacted to gain group acceptance or support, which are also key to survival in evolutionary contexts (1)

The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is one key brain region implicated in conflict monitoring and detection:

-updating behavior in response to misalignment with the group is associated with increased activity within this region as well as in anterior insula (AI), a region hypothesized to encode the discomfort of being mis- aligned with the group (1).

One study was able to downregulate the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC), overlapping with dACC, during a social influence task. This manipulation reduced conformity to social influence, possibly by interrupting key processes relevant to reinforcement learning, and hence social conformity.

individual differences in reactivity to social exclusion within dACC, AI, and subgenual cingulate predicted susceptibility to risky social influence in teens in a driving context one week after data were collected within these hypothesized regions using fMRI 

- sensitivity to social conflict and distress in form of anticipated or actual ‘social pain' may contribute to conformity: individuals may conform to avoid negative social consequences and promote social bonding (2)

Valuation: the positive value placed on positive social relationships
Expected or experienced reward of social belonging or approval from others is thought to motivate conformity (2)

The ventral striatum (VS) and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are known to respond to a wide variety of rewarding stimuli, including primary and secondary rewards

In studies of social conformity, neural activity within VS and VMPFC have been implicated in updating preferences to be in line with group opinions

One study: (Edelson et al. 2011): directly tested neural differences between public and private conformity, however, found that brain regions hypothesized to be involved in conflict detection (dACC) during compliance decisions were associated with public compliance, while amygdala and hippocampus activity was associated with private opinion changes.

whether neural activity in each of the brain systems reviewed above directly produce private acceptance of norms, or whether this activity reflects anticipated or actual reward (or distress) derived from alignment (or misalignment) with the group (2)


Moderators of neural conformity effects:
neural underpinnings of social influence are modulated by message source variables (such as communicator celebrity and expertise), and in-group versus out-group status (2)

For example, the mere presence of another peer is associated with increased activity in hypothesized reward regions (VS, orbitofrontal cortex) during the decision-making process in adolescents (compared to adults), which in turn is associated with increased risk-taking (Chein et al. 2011)

the power of social variables (e.g., group closeness, peer presence, and ex- pertise) to influence the relationship between neural processing and social influence outcomes

highlight the importance of longitudinal research to capture changes that occur within individuals over development. 


Brain-as-Predictor Approach (3)
Real-world behavioural predicitons from brain-activity:
"activity in key brain regions can predict longitu- dinal behavior outside the laboratory" (3)

Sunscreen (Falk et al. 2010): 
individual differences in VMPFC activity during persuasive message exposure successfully predicted participants' changes in sunscreen use one week after the scanning session compared to baseline usage beyond the participants' self-reported attitudes toward sunscreen and intentions to change their behavior


Smoking (Falk et al. 2013):
research examining the effectiveness of smoking quit messages found that increased activity in the VMPFC during ad exposure predicted reductions in smoking one month following the scanning session compared to baseline beyond a number of self-report measures collected (3)

The authors of these behavior change studies suggest that the VMPFC may integrate information about the value placed on message content with respect to one's own goals and motivations (3)

Differences in participants' average responses to campaigns within VMPFC have also predicted success of the cam- paigns at the population level above and beyond standard self-report measures (Falk et al. 2014, Falk et al. 2011)

Influencing Others:
The TPJ is commonly associated with considering the intentions and perspectives of others, called mentalizing:
existing studies highlight the importance of increased temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activity in communicators who effectively influence others (3)

"The salesperson theory of mind scale": 
increased activity in bilateral TPJ and the medial prefrontal cortex was correlated with an increased self-reported likelihood to mentalize about consumers' cognitive states, which in turn was associated with greater sales performance 
(Dietvorst et al. 2009)

authors suggest that those who were more successful in propagating their own preferences may have engaged in mentalizing (e.g., considering how to make relevant information useful for others) during initial idea encoding inside the scanner

contextualizing neural data with tools from social network analysis (SNA):

Eg. the "ego betweenness centrality" 
a measure of information brokerage capacity — the extent to which an individual connects otherwise unconnected individuals within their network, and hence is positioned to broker the spread of ideas and information 

Those higher in betweenness centrality showed more mentalizing activity when making recom- mendations and updating them in response to peer feedback compared to those who are lower in ego betweenness centrality; the authors suggest that having access to more diverse points of view or more practice translating ideas between different groups may encourage use of the brain's mentalizing system in day to day life, and/or that those who tend to engage in more mentalizing may position themselves in greater brokerage roles},

abstract = {Contemporary theories emphasize the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in assigning hedonic values to rewards. Although prior research supports this view, recent findings suggest that opioids play a larger and more complex role in reward processes than these theories suggest. For example, opioid activity in the basolateral amygdala is required for encoding incentive learning, a process by which the value of goal-directed actions is updated. Outside of the amygdala, opioid receptors in the ventral striatum have been found to promote choice between different courses of action. Specifically, $\mu$-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and $\delta$-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell have been reported to mediate distinct aspects of incentive motivation; the core regulating the effect of experienced reward and the shell of predicted reward on choice. In both cases, the involvement of opioid receptors was restricted to the time of choice, although changes in their expression pattern could be observed prior to that point. This time restricted involvement of opioid receptor-related processes is consistent with the view that opioids in the nucleus accumbens are central components of the limbic-motor interface, integrating reward-related information with instrumental learning to guide decision-making, particularly the selection and execution of goal-directed actions.},

abstract = {Eudaimonic well-being reflects traits concerned with personal growth, self-acceptance, purpose in life and autonomy (among others) and is a substantial predictor of life events, including health. Although interest in the aetiology of eudaimonic well-being has blossomed in recent years, little is known of the underlying neural substrates of this construct. To address this gap in our knowledge, here we examined whether regional gray matter (GM) volume was associated with eudaimonic well-being. Structural magnetic resonance images from 70 young, healthy adults who also completed Ryff's 42-item measure of the six core facets of eudaimonia, were analysed with voxel-based morphometry techniques. We found that eudaimonic well-being was positively associated with right insular cortex GM volume. This association was also reflected in three of the sub-scales of eudaimonia: personal growth, positive relations and purpose in life. Positive relations also showed a significant association with left insula volume. No other significant associations were observed, although personal growth was marginally associated with left insula, and purpose in life exhibited a marginally significant negative association with middle temporal gyrus GM volume. These findings are the first to our knowledge linking eudaimonic well-being with regional brain structure.},
annote = {Eudaimonia: ‘virtuous activity of [the] soul'
conscious and life-long active exercise of intellect and character virtues (615)

Urry et al., 2004:
The first and only study directly examining neural correlates of eudaimonic well-being found evidence for an association with frontal cortex activity: greater left than right superior frontal cortex activation (measured using electroencephalography) is associated with eudaimonic (and hedonic) well-being (615)

the ‘default network' (Gusnard et al., 2001; Buckner et al., 2008)?specifically, the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex?may be related to eudaimonic well-being, on account of links from the default network to representations of self (Lou et al., 1999) and internal modes of cognition (Buckner et al., 2008), these cognitive processes are closely analogous to the characteristics ascribed to eudaimonia (

Archontaki et al. (2013) recently noted that the mechanism underlying eudaimonia must be capable of exerting control across all facets of eudaimonia, implying a top-down control mechan- ism over multiple systems processing emotional, reward incentive and motivational information related to eudaimonic well-being (616).

The Current Study:
novel links between GM volume and a broad range of psychological traits (Kanai and Rees 2011; Lewis et al., 2012)?including traits with clear relevance for eudaimonic well-being such as depressive symptoms (Hwang et al., 2010; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2011; Bechdolf et al., 2012) and mindful- ness (Holzel et al., 2008) and so present as a plausible approach for delineating the neural architecture of eudaimonic well-being.

Method:
n=70, mean age 24.6, 42 females
42-item Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-being
MR Imaging

Results:
- Eudaimonia was positively and significantly correlated with the GM volume of right insular cortex (616)
- Purpose in life, positive relations and personal growth scores all showed positive correlations with right insular cortex volumes
- positive relations and personal growth scores were also positively correlated with left insular cortex volume 
- purpose in life showed a marginal negative correlation with middle temporal gyrus (617)

Discussion:
eudaimonia is fundamentally linked to notions of agency (Waterman, 1993), and recent work has identified insular cortex as a source of agentic control (Lee and Reeve, 2013)
The insula has also been linked to facilitation of self-awareness (Craig, 2009), 
as well as to the regulation of bodily states and modulation of decision making based on intero- ceptive information about these bodily states (Singer et al., 2009)
mindfulness meditation, a trait with prima facie links to eudaimonia, has been associated with right insular cortex GM volume (Ho
¨lzel et al., 2008).

In sum, then, insula cortex may facilitate eudaimonic well-being by generating a set of capacities which jointly act to integrate interoceptive states with exter- nal circumstances, and successfully manage this emotional milieu (618).},

-There is a need to combine multivariate longitudinal research that incorporates developmental trajectories with mechanistic studies that interrogate neurophysiological processes. 
- Resilience is a key area for further research




Note: this macro-data on two types of well-being is alsmost purely taken from Nth American surverys, and indeed the psychology movement to interrogate and nuance meausres of well-being is an American epistemological phenomenon that grew out of post-war sociology (1383).

Two types of well-being:
Eudaimonic Well-being and Hedonic well-being (subjective well-being). 

"The core hypothesis of positive health, in fact, is that the experience of well-being contributes to the effective functioning of multiple biological systems, which may help keep the organism from succumbing to disease, or, when illness or adversity occurs, may help promote rapid recovery" (1383)

Two types of well-being vary as a function of age, socio-econ- omic status, and race/ethnicity (1383)

Also, "how well-being is affected by various challenges in life, such as parenthood, including having a child with disabilities, growing up with an alcoholic parent, giving care to an ill or disabled significant other, or experiencing relocation" (1384).

Age variation in eudaimonic well-being:
-Self-acceptance shows little variation
- Environmental mastery shows increments
- Purpose in life and personal growth show decrements
(Cross-sectional findings leave unanswered whether such patterns are due to cohort differences or maturational processes) (1384)

"longitudinal queries have demonstrated that eudaimonic well-being is not trait-like, but rather is dynamic, showing cross-time change as individuals negotiate particular life transitions" (1384).

Socio-economic standing:
EWB positively correlated with educational atainment and occupational status.
-Variability in in EWB increases as one moves down the educational hierarchy - substantial numbers of individuals with limited educational attainment nonetheless have high eudaimonic well-being (Markus et al. 2004)

ethnic minority status is a positive predictor of well-being: i.e. American minorities, on average, are more likely to have high eudaimonic well-being than their white majority counterparts (Ryff et al. 2003)

A key question from the positive health perspective is whether "high eudaimonic well-being in contexts of inequality, or discrimination, confers protection at biological levels" (1384)?


Subjective well-being:
Ageing: 
-increases in life satisfaction with age (Shmotkin 1990; Diener {\&} Suh 1998)

-positive affect (cross-sectional and longitudinal) evidence of both decline and gains with age, whereas negative affect seems to remain stable for some and decline for others (Shmotkin 1990; Diener {\&} Suh 1998; Mroczek {\&} Kolarz 1998; Charles et al. 2001) (1385).

- The average older age profile of hedonic well-being is mostly positive, a finding that has led many to focus on the adaptation processes that older persons employ to maintain their levels of happiness and life satisfaction (Diener et al. 1999) 

Socio-economic standing: 
wealthier people are consistently found to be happier than poorer people, but the effects are small (Diener et al. 1999) (1385). 

relation between wealth of a nation and average levels of subjective well-being is positive and strong (Diener et al. 1995a). 

research both within and between countries has clari- fied that increases in income are not associated with increases in well-being (Diener et al. 1993; Diener {\&} Suh 1997), 
suggesting that expectations, goals and comparison processes influence subjective well-being (1385). 

people who strongly desire money and wealth (defined as extrinsic goals) are more unhappy than those who do not (Kasser {\&} Ryan 1993, 1996)

--{\textgreater} how about people who strongly desire full-stop??? Attachment, grasping, and drive towards any object could cause an unhealthy well-being response (on a physiological level - the dopaminergic systems (tonic and phasic) modulating such behaviours). 

Hedonia and Eudaimonia are related but distinct constructs:
the best-fitting model (MIDUS national sample, n=3032, aged 25-74yrs) is one that posits two correlated latent constructs rather than one general factor, or two orthogonal factors (1385):
- although highly correlated, each construct retains its uniqueness as a separ- ate component of overall well-being
- Not surprisingly, it is the strongly existential aspects of eudaimonic well-being (i.e. purpose in life, personal growth) that are most sharply differentiated from the affective and life satisfaction assessments of hedonic well-being.
--{\textgreater} those existential components that require a moral judgement? 


The probability of optimal well-being, defined as being high on both eudaimonic and hedonic well-being, increased as age, education, extra- version and conscientiousness increased and as neuroti- cism decreased

Those with higher eudaimonic than hedonic well-being (ca. 23{\%} of the sample) tended to be younger, have more education and have higher levels of openness to experience
(1385)

Those with higher hedonic than eudaimonic well-being (ca. 22{\%}of the sample) less education, were more likely to be midlife and older adults, and had lower levels of openness to experience (1385)

This is a useful starting point to investigate the biological markers of well-being. 

Well-being and links to biology: 
Sample of ageing women (n= 135) General Clinical Research Centre University of Wisconsin-Madison

Well-being measures:
Eudaimonic: 14-item scales of the six dimensions of well-being (Ryff 1989)
Hedonic: positive affect, 1) 10 items from PNAS. Inventory (Watson et al. 1988) that asked how the respondent felt (eg. excited, enthusiastic, proud, alert, determined) and 2) 14 items from the short-form MASQ (Watson et al. 1995) that asked respodents how much they had felt positive emotions ( e.g. happy, cheerful, optimistic, having fun, looking forward to things) in the past week (1386). 

Biomarkers:

1. Neuroendocrine (diurnal cortisol slope, three time points throught the day for a period of four days, overnight urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline, and, from fasting blood samples, dihydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S)) (1386). 

Results: 

- No significant effects were evident for hedonic well-being.


- Significant positive associations were found between average daily slope of salivary cortisol and per- sonal growth for the aged 65+ sample. For the age 75+ sample, significant effects were obtained for both personal growth and purpose in life

- Older women with higher levels of personal growth and purpsose in life had flatter daily slopes of salivary cortisol:
"Subsequent examination of means at the three diurnal points clarified that indi- viduals with higher scores on purpose and growth started the day with lower levels of salivary cortisol and stayed lower through the day than individuals with lower scores on these two dimensions of eudaimonic well-being" (1387). 

Fig 2{\&} 3: (the association between obtained slopes, averaged across 4 days, and the given scale of well-being)
(1387)

women with higher scores on autonomy, which assessed the capacity to follow one's own convictions (even if they go against conventional wisdom), had significantly higher levels of noradrenaline than women reporting lower levels of autonomy (1387)


2. Immune corellates: i

1) inflamatory response, in particular chronic inflammatory processes, characterized by the presence of certain cytokines, particularly IL-6, are implicated in diverse health outcomes (atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome X) (Black 2003).

2) The interplay between stress and hormonal signals (glucocorticoids) that terminate inflammation has also received attention (Miller et al. 2002).

Hypothesis: high well-being, lower levels of inflammatory cytokines (1387). 

Results: 
EWBL - higher levels of life purpose significantly lower levels of lIL-6r. 
no significant differences for hedonic wellbeing. 



3. Cardiovascular: 
neuroendocrine and inflammation markers have
been studied as primary mediators of cardiovascular risk (Sapolsky et al. 2000)

Results:
Numerous significant effects are evident for eudaimonic dimensions of well- being, with all effects being in the predicted direction: i.e. those with higher well-being had lower cardiovascular risk.
(1388)

- scores on positive relations with others were negatively linked with weight, waist–hip ratio and glycosylated haemoglobin (a marker for diabetes)

- Personal growth was positively correlated with HDL, the good cholesterol, and negatively with the total to HDL cholesterol ratio (for the full sample and those aged 65+).

- Purpose in life was also positively correlated with HDL cholesterol (full sam- ple and those aged 65+) and negatively with waist–hip ratio

- higher levels of environmental mastery and self-acceptance had significantly lower levels of glycosylated haemoglobin

(1389)


4. Sleep Correlates:
Sleep and restorative functions (Sejnowski {\&} Destexhe 2000), circadian regulation may be an important prerequisite for the main- tenance of host defences against cancer (Sephton{\&}Spiegel 2003), Sleep has also been shown to play a mediating role in the link between socio-economic status and health (Moore et al. 2002), and among healthy older adults, those with longer sleep latencies and poorer sleep efficiency were at greater risk of death than those with shorter latencies and better sleep efficiency (Drew et al. 2003) (1388).

Question: whether high profiles of eudai- monic or hedonic well-being are conducive to good sleep patterns?

Results:

environmental mastey (age 65+) had longer periods of time in bed, longer sleep duration, and longer REM sleep than those with lower levels of environmental mastery, also had earlier onset of REM sleep than those with lower levels of mastery

higher levels of positive relations with others had longer REM sleep and lower duration of body moving during sleep.

Caveats: 

health status revealed no significant links to eudaimonic or hedonic well-being. 

However, women with higher numbers of chronic conditions did have significantly
higher weights, waist–hip ratios, and levels of glycosylated haemo- globin, and lower levels of DHEA-S 
(1389).

Although our focus is on psychological well-being, men-
tal maladjustment (depression) may also be implicated in the above associations with biomarkers

Surely now we know that these two are interrelated? 

relationship between prior life challenges (e.g. abuse) and subsequent pathophysiology of depression and anxiety, as well as between major depression and its distal con- sequences for the stress system (Meyer et al. 2001; Penza et al. 2002)

we partitioned the sample into those who had experienced depression and those who had not, and then re-ran all analyses. 
For women with no history of depression (n = 113), the majority of previous effects (75{\%}) remained statistically significant; if significant trends were included, 89{\%} of the previous effects were still evident. 

Alternatively, among women with prior episode(s) of major depression (n ¼ 22), there were, with two exceptions, no significant associations between well-being and biomarkers. The small size of the depression sample could, of course, account for the lack of effects.
(1389)
- the two significant associations that did occur pertained to a single eudaimonic measure (personal growth), which was correlated with two neuroendocrine factors:

women with depression in their past, those with higher levels of personal growth had significantly lower levels of
adrenaline (r = 0.43, p {\textless} 0.05) and significantly higher slopes of salivary cortisol (r = 0.60, p {\textless} 0.01)

Discussion:

Limited nature of these results (small sample, cross-sectional design, bivariate analyses):

there is a need to construct longitudinal, multivaraiate analysis of measures of well-being and their biomarkers (1390).


Cardiovascular discussion and overlap between psychosocial/demographic and well-being predictors of cardiovascular biomarkers: 
Eudaimonic well-being, particularly the dimensions of
positive relations with others, personal growth and purpose in life, also revealed extensive links to cardiovascular mar- kers, with all effects occurring in the predicted direction. Thus, older women with higher levels of eudaimonic well- being had lower levels of glycosylated haemoglobin, lower waist–hip ratios and lower total/HDL cholesterol ratios, and they weighed less than those with lower levels of eudai- monic well-being. Those with higher levels of personal growth and life purpose also had significantly higher levels of HDL, the good cholesterol, than those who reported less purposeful engagement and continued growth. Again, these findings extend prior literatures, which have docu- mented not only that such cardiovascular markers are pre- dictive of downstream coronary heart disease, diabetes and atherosclerosis (e.g. Badimon et al. 1992; Seeman et al. 1993; Corti et al. 1995; Feldman{\&} Steptoe 2003), but also that psychosocial and socio-demographic factors (e.g. sense of control, coping, social support, socio-economic status) are linked with such biomarkers (e.g. Feldman {\&} Steptoe 2003).
(1390) 

Why did hedonic well-being show so few connections to biology? One possibility is that most people report themselves to be happy (Diener {\&} Diener 1996)

--- there may be less variation in reports of positive affect, which in turn restricts the linkage that can be shown with biology.

--- positive affect may require different bio- markers, such as dopamine (Depue {\&} Collins 1999a,b)or serotonin (Katz 1999), to show effects

Flourishing and its attendant biology may, however, require an enriched array of biomarkers (e.g. endorphins, dopamine, opioid peptides, oxytocin (Ryff {\&} Singer 1998; Taylor et al. 2003)). (1391)

Crucial to blend longitudinal studies with short-term mechanistic studies (1391):
"mechanistic studies ignore naturally occurring trajectories of change in psychosocial and bio- logical profiles with consequences for health, while longi- tudinal, epidemiological inquiries fail to clarify mechanistic processes. Both levels of inquiry are fundamental for advancing the positive health agenda, and ideal designs for bridging these levels of inquiry are those that blend both types of research"

Eudaimonia and resilience:
-those who have maintained (or regained) high eudaimonic well- being in the face of major life challenges (e.g. relocation, caregiving)
-those who sustain high eudaimonic well-being despite socio-economic disadvantage (Singer {\&} Ryff 1999; Ryff et al. 2004) or ethnic/minority status (Ryff et al. 2003). What},

annote = {Link between adversity, meaning making, and self realization

Nietzsche's (1889) observation, “From life's school of war: what does not kill me makes me stronger.”

positive adaptation to stress adversity in children: 
children of schizophrenic mothers (Garmezy, 1974; Masten, Best, {\&} Garmezy, 1990) and children of poor families living (Garmezy, 1991; Garmezy, Masten, {\&} Tellegen, 1984), some of whom were judged by teachers and peers to be competent and without behavior problems.

Werner, another early resilience researcher, followed a cohort of children born into poverty and troubled family environments, about a third of whom grew up to be competent, confident, caring adults (Werner, 1995; Werner {\&} Smith, 1977, 1992). Her conception of resilience emphasized sustained competence under stress.
(2)

Handbook of Resilience (Reich, Zautra, {\&} Hall, 2010):
ethnic and cultural conceptions of resilience
"resilience is best formulated as the successful adaptation to adversity, which includes recovery (how people bounce back from challenge) and sustainability (the capacity to continue forward in the face of adversity)" (2)

Eudaimonia approach to resilience
meaning making: "finding, and frequently creating, meaning in one's confrontation with significant life challenge. Such actions represent higher order human capacities for "transforming pain or loss into sources of insight and deepened understanding of self and others" (3)

Growth in the aftermath of trauma, crisis, or suffering has been elaborated in other literatures (Park, 1998; Tedeschi {\&} Calhoun, 1995; Tedeschi, Park, {\&} Calhoun, 1998), but the framing of such growth is different from the realization of personal capacities and talents emphasized in the eudiamonic approach


Aristotle: each person has to know and live in truth with his or her daimon. Eudaimonia thus translates to meaningful living conditioned on self-truth and self-responsibility (3).

Bertrand Russell (1930/1958) backs up the 2-prongs of eudaimonia happiness is something that requires work and hard work; further, in his view, it follows mostly from zest (active interest and engagement in life) and affection (meaningful bonds of love with others). 

Jung: knowing one's dark side (the shadow). Individuation involved a deliverance from convention in which one no longer subscribes to the collective beliefs and fears of the masses (4)
Rogers: continually becoming rather than achieving a fixed state
Aristotle: formulation of the interpersonal realm as a central feature of a well-lived life 
Maslow: the empathy and affection that accompanies self-actualization


The idea of BLOOMING: looking into the abyss leads to blooming, to "openning up" to others, to the interpersonal realm, to cooperation, (to more reward?) Is this a mechanism of altruistic commitment to the group? or a mechanism through which the individual organism is better able to navigate and interact in the social realm (agency)? Eudaimonia is a prosocial mechanism leading to self and interpersonal growth and energy...(flourishing!)

Puropose in life is heavily contingent on beliefs, and hope (4).

Autonomy is thus a notably Western aspect of well-being (4)

the components of eudaimonic well-being delineate the scope and nature of how one is functioning in the face of challenge (5): namely purpose in life and positive relations with others

well-being is sometimes honed and nurtured via active engagement with adversity - - Personal Growth 

Challenges (failure and disappointment) require finding inner strenght and resources of renewal: While personal capacities may be deepened, self-knowledge may also be expanded, including paradoxically, awareness of one's limitations and vulnerabilities (5).

Positive relations with others may be enriched enriched in encounters with life difficulties.

interpersonal flourishing in most lives is about the complex mix of positive and negative emotions, which comprise our most significant human ties. Purpose in life, as articulated by Frankl, is fundamentally about meaning-making in the face of trauma:

Resilience demands a focus on hardship or adversity; i.e., some kind of life challenge.

socioeconomic inequality:
interesting greater variability in well-being for low education levels:
Morozink et al 2010: educational status is associated with a marker of inflammation known as IL-6 (Interluekin -6), which is a precursor to multiple disease outcomes. As hypothesized, those who were educationally disadvantaged showed higher levels of this biological risk factor, on average. However, there was variability in the eudiamonic well-being among those with only a high school education or less, such that some showed high levels of purpose in life, environmental mastery, self-acceptance, and positive relations with others, despite their low educational status. Importantly, high well-being moderated the effect of educational standing on IL-6. Such findings suggest that well-being may serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of low SES on inflammatory risk (5-6).

Miller et al. 2011: many individuals, despite growing up in impoverished environments, do not exhibit health problems in midlife, assessed in terms of metabolic syndrome middle aged individuals who grew up in low socioeconomic environments did not have higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome if they had received high maternal nurturance in childhood (6).

Chen et al. 2012: found that adults from low childhood SES environments who engaged in various cognitive and emotional strategies (“shift and persist”) in response to life stressors also did not exhibit elevated allostatic load

Markus et al. 2004: Open-ended interviews revealed unique personal profiles among these educationally disadvantaged who nonetheless had high eudaimonic well-being: above all, they were interpersonally oriented – that is, concerned about caring for others and upholding their responsibilities to others. 

Minority Status:
Ryff, Keyes, {\&} Hughes, 2003: minority status predicted higher psychological well-being (multiple dimensions) than majority status (after adjusting for age, gender, educational attainment). These unexpected effects were even more pronounced when perceived discrimination was controlled. Such findings suggested that the challenges of minority life in the U.S. seemed to hone psychological strengths, such as life purpose and personal growth (6)

The evolved self-management system?? "Increasingly, evidence shows that these factors are protective buffers against risk of poor health, measured in terms of regulation of diverse physiological systems" (6)



aging: 

Seeman et al. (2011) linked social contact and support to cognitive abilities and found that those with greater contact and support had higher executive function and better episodic memory, whereas decline in social measures was associated with negative cognitive profiles, especially among younger adults

volunteering and making charitable donations has positive effects on psychological well-being among those age 55 and above, possibly attributable to the sense of self-efficacy, altruism, or the desire to do good deeds

among those who are able to maintain high eudaimonia (e.g., active, engaged, purposeful, socially related living), risk of physical decline and cognitive deterioration are substantially reduced. Aging, in short, is an arena of dramatic individual differences, wherein those who maintain high well-being reveal notable benefits, not only in terms of their subjective experience, but also with regard to their health and functional capacities (8). 


targeted life stressors: 

- physical abuse during childhood:
Pitzer and Fingerman (2010): effects of child abuse on adult physical health and negative affect were less severe for individuals with a greater sense of agency over their lives

Greenfield and Marks (2010) linked physical and psychological abuse in childhood to psychological distress in adulthood, and further examined one's sense of community as a moderator of these effects. As predicted, high community support was protective against high distress among those who experienced abuse in childhood

cancer:
Costanzo, Ryff, and Singer (2009)
depressive symptoms worsened over time among cancer survivors compared to matched controls, but - 
cross-time changes in mood, psychological well-being, social well-being, and spirituality over time were similar to those observed for individuals not dealing with the challenge of cancer.

Prudrovska (2010), in turn, examined changes in personal growth over time among cancer survivors and a non-cancer comparison group. Although personal growth declined in the longitudinal sample overall, such decline was not evident in young adults with cancer compared to same-aged adults without cancer

Spousal loss (9): 
Ong et al. (2010): Spousal loss was linked with decreasing positive emotions over time, but the effect was moderated by positive reappraisal. Those who lost a spouse and who had higher positive reappraisal profiles had less decrease in positive emotions following their loss

Ong, Fuller-Rowell, Bonanno, and Almeida (2011) found that spousal loss predicted subsequent diurnal cortisol dysregulation, with these effects partially explained by changes in positive emotion. Such findings were consistent with the theoretical framework linking emotional resilience to physical health.
In

Those who were able to find meaning, experience personal growth, and enjoy good social relationships as they negotiated losses or hardship thus seemed to benefit, not only phenomenologically, but also with regard to maintaining well-regulated biological systems
(9)

Autobiographical accounts of resilience: 

essential role of strong social ties as negative experience is transformed into powerful insights that fuel personal growth

Mark Mathabane, Kaffir Boy (1986):

Social support in face of struggles and hardship: 
"...he would remember how much it helps to have someone loving and understanding, to share in one's dark periods. Importantly, he saw the meaning that could follow – “life takes its true meaning in proportion to one's daily battles with suffering” (p.170) (11)

Language provides the parameters in which meaning can be constructed:
"Inside Mathabane, however, were great personal resources as well, such as the capacity to extract meaning from his ordeal, including the appreciation of the good that can follow from suffering as well as his powerful drive to speak other languages and make the most of his talents. His commitment to his own becoming was pivotal" (12)

Language, ToM, perspective taking, moral capacity - a capacity to situate personal existence in a socio-cultural milieu - meaning is a moral project.

Ben Mattlin, Miracle Boy Grows Up (2012):
"light a candle instead of cursing the darkness" (13)
"mourn the losses, and move on" (14)
"we keep planning, mourning what's lost, celebrating what's gained, and then going on." (15)

Victor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning (1945):
that life holds meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable (15)

the only thing he could keep was his bare body

As a psychiatrist, Frankl recognized that some guards among them were true sadists. Still, what caused the greatest pain in these beatings was, in his view, less the physical than the insult the beatings implied. He recalled moments when even the most hardened prisoners had their indignation aroused during a beating; it was the personal insult rather than excruciating pain that fueled such a response (15)

His own inward journey became a discovery of hidden resources:

they stumbled along in the darkness over big stones and through puddles while the icy wind blew around them. Someone said, “If our wives could see us now.”
...
“My mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness.
...
for the first time in my life I saw the truth{\ldots}. that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire” (pp.48-49). For Frankl, the deeper realization, however, was that nothing could touch the strength of his love and the image of his beloved. Instead, he felt her there with him, he was able to “stretch out my hand and grasp hers”

---{\textgreater} the epiphanic moment of realisation in the face of struggle

This intensification of his inner life helped him to find refuge from the emptiness, desolation, and spiritual poverty of his existence (16).

“{\ldots}.everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances” (16)

high moral behavior was still possible through the attitude one held toward one's existence – “His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden” (p.86).

Hope, belief and the psychophysiological reality:
"Those who know how close the connection is between the state of the mind of a man – his courage and hope, or lack of them – and the state of immunity in his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have deadly effect" (17)

The constancy of struggle in living: 
"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state, but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him” (p.110)" (17)

health benefits appear to follow for those who find and sustain well-being, despite the existential challenges of living (18).

an overarching message is that social relationships, past and present, are an undeniable thread throughout human tales of resilience (18).},

Through historical analysis, studies of norms (tightness-looseness; Study 1) and cultural products (content analyses of newspaper headlines, venture capital firm websites, hospital websites; Studies 2-4), and studies assessing individuals' self and well-being (Studies 5-7), we compared Boston and San Francisco-similar cities on many metrics. We find that self and well-being are, in some important part, local. Reflecting themes of "old and established," Boston's history and cultural products emphasize tradition, status, and community, and social norms are relatively tight; accordingly feelings and selves are socially contingent. In contrast, reflecting themes of "new and free," San Francisco's history and cultural products emphasize unlimited possibility, egalitarianism, and innovation, and social norms are relatively loose; accordingly feelings and selves are relatively less contingent on others.},

abstract = {Hierarchy can be conceptualized as objective social status (e.g., education level) or subjective social status (i.e., one's own judgment of one's status). Both forms predict well-being. This is the first investigation of the relative strength of these hierarchy-well-being relationships in the U.S. and Japan, cultural contexts with different normative ideas about how social status is understood and conferred. In probability samples of Japanese (N = 1,027) and U.S. (N = 1,805) adults, subjective social status more strongly predicted life satisfaction, positive affect, sense of purpose, and self-acceptance in the United States than in Japan. In contrast, objective social status more strongly predicted life satisfaction, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance in Japan than in the United States. These differences reflect divergent cultural models of self. The emphasis on independence characteristic of the United States affords credence to one's own judgment (subjective status), and the interdependence characteristic of Japan gives weight to what others can observe (objective status).},
annote = {Well-being and its sources differ across cultural contexts. In Japan, well-being centers more around well-managed relation- ships with others, while in the United States, it depends more on individuals' personal feelings and emotions (Kitayama {\&} Markus, 2000; Mesquita {\&} Leu, 2007; Uchida, Townsend, Markus,{\&}Bergsieker, 2009). These differences reflect the dif- ferent models of self pervasive in these contexts (Markus {\&} Kitayama, 2003). These models are inscribed in individual atti- tudes and values and are also built into the institutions, prac- tices, and artifacts that organize everyday life (Markus {\&} Conner, 2013).

independent model of self, nor- mative in mainstream U.S. contexts, people are understood as fundamentally independent from others.
individ- uals' own perceptions and subjective reactions are the primary determinants of thoughts, feelings, and actions, and their own internal psychological states are attended to and emphasized (Markus {\&} Kitayama, 2010)

As in all contexts, others' judg- ments influence thought and behavior, but one's own views are the most accessible referent for self-evaluation and accomplish- ment. Such a context affords self-rated (i.e., subjective) social status a particularly important role in well-being

interdependent model of self that is normative in Japan, people are understood as fundamen- tally interconnected with important others
Self-assessment in Japan, therefore, is less about ‘‘what do I think or feel?'' and more about ‘‘how am I viewed by others?'' (Lebra, 2008).
public and institutionalized benchmarks of suc- cess that signal the community's respect are primary referents for self-evaluation (Leung and Cohen, 2011;Wirtz{\&}Scollon, 2012)

Objective benchmarks are powerful because they reflect the relevant in-groups' shared and normative under- standings made real in the world


Method:

Well-being

Hedonic: Life satisfaction and positive affect
Life satisfaction: 1-item rating of current life satisfaction (0 ¼ worst possible, 10 ¼ best possible)

Positive affect: PANAS (Watson et al. 1988), the frequency (1 = none of the time, 5 = all of the time) of experiencing each of the following states during the previous 2 weeks: cheerful, in good spirits, extremely happy, calm and peaceful, satisfied, full of life, enthusiastic, attentive, proud, confident, active, full of life, close to others, and like you
belong (validated in Japan - Sato {\&} Yasuda 2001).

Eudaimonic Well-being:
7-point Likert-type scale: 
autonomy (e.g., My decisions are not usually influenced by what everyone else is doing;
environmental mas- tery (e.g., In general, I feel I am in charge of the situation in
which I live, 
personal growth (e.g., For me, life has been a continuous pro-
cess of learning, changing, and growth, positive relations with others (e.g., I know that I can trust my friends, and they know they can
trust me)
purpose in life (e.g., Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I
am not one of them), 
self-acceptance (e.g., When I look at the story of my
life, I am pleased with how things have turned out)

Results:
As hypothesized, subjective social status showed a robust
pattern of stronger effects on well-being in the United States than Japan, while, in contrast, objective social status showed a robust pattern of stronger effects on well-being in Japan than in the United States

the associations between subjective social status and the well-being outcomes that were stronger in the United States were those that predicted
life satisfaction, b ¼?.08, t(2,708) ¼?4.35, p {\textless} .001;

In contrast, The associations between objective social status and the well-being outcomes were significantly stronger in Japan than in
the United States for 
life satisfaction b ¼ .09, t(2,708) ¼ 3.91, p {\textless} .001;

the association between objective social status and
the well-being composite was significantly stronger in Japan
than in the United States, b ¼ .05, t(2,733) ¼ 2.34, p {\textless}.05

Discussion:

- the beliefs and practices of U.S. culture sanction an independent model of the self in which one's own subjective judgments —rather than others' judgments—are the primary referent for the evaluation of self-worth and accomplishment (Markus {\&} Kitayama, 2010)

the beliefs and practices of East Asian cultures, including Japan, foster an interdependent model of the self in which the socially consensual, publically accorded aspects of the self (i.e., objective factors such as one's degree or position in a company, etc.) are the primary referent for self-assessment and are salient in everyday social interactions (e.g., Leung and Cohen, 2011; Rai{\&}Fiske, 2011)

abstract = {This article contextualizes and critiques the recent increase in interest in virtue ethics and the good life (eudaimonia) in psychology. Theoretically, psychologists' interests in virtue and eudaimonia have followed the philosophical revival of these topics, but this work has been subject to persistent, disguised commitments to the ideologies of individualism and instrumentalism. Moreover, psychologists' tendency to separate the topics of virtue and eudaimonia is described and critiqued as theoretically misguided, particularly because Aristotle, the originator of these concepts, saw them as mutually entailing one another. Historically, psychology turned away from the topic of virtue in tandem with the popular cultural interest in favor of personality rather than character. The article concludes with a brief overview of Aristotle's account of eudaimonia as the overarching human good consisting of participation in characteristically human goods (e.g., knowledge, belonging) through virtuous activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},
annote = {Individualism and instrumentalism in psychology:

some notable psychologists remain surprisingly ambivalent about acknowledging that virtue and the good life are inherently moral concepts that cannot be investigated solely from a detached, value-neutral perspective if they are to be studied scientifically (e.g., Peterson {\&} Seligman, 2004) (1)


Individual as strategic actor

Aristotle's (1999) philosophy forms the basis for most of this work in psychology, whether that is explicitly acknowl- edged or not. From an Aristotelian perspective, virtues are simply the excellences that make it possible to live the good life, meaning that these two concepts mutually entail one another (1)

psychology's efforts to account for human action have been hamstrung by the im- plausible attempt to sharply separate facts and values (2)

Individualism takes the individual to be the ultimate social reality and views the autonomous pursuit and satisfaction of individually defined ends as the ultimate goods in life (Bellah et al., 1985) (2)

The predominant understanding is that individuals pursue their chosen goods instrumentally, which means that they have subjectively predetermined ends, and they select the best strategies, techniques, and skills to attain those ends.

Self-determination theory (Ryan {\&} Deci 2000): three universal human needs: autonomy, competence, and social relatedness (2). 

These theories portray individuals as traders and relationships as quid pro quo interactions to be continued as long as the individuals believe they are getting a rea- sonably good relationship “deal.” (2)

Ironically, neutrality about individual ends was adopted in the service of maintaining objectivity. This supposed neutrality is belied, however, because taking a neutral stance on what is needed or desired by leav- ing it to the individual is at the core of indi- vidualism and viewing behaviors as mere means to individual ends is the definition of instrumentalism

psychology has unwittingly built individual- ism and instrumentalism into its understand- ing of the good throughout its theory, re- search, and practice (3).


Hermeneutic Philosophy (3):
addresses human goods by clarifying that people are al- ways living out a vision of the human good every day, both personally and professionally. All people inherit a set of ethical commitments from and are shaped by ongoing historical com- munities with their understandings of the good

we perceive and move within a moral space oriented to particular goods (Taylor, 1989) (3): 




Aristotle located the good at the center of human action because it orients all choice and activity

Character and virtue fell into disfavor as the discipline attempted to split scientific fact from moral value in its drive to become an accepted social science (Nicholson, 1998; Ross {\&} Nis- bett, 1991) (4)

Allport (1937) engaged in a sustained critique of character as a fitting subject for psychology. His pointed couplet is emblematic for this move: “Character is personality evaluated, and per- sonality is character devaluated” (p. 52, em- phasis in original).


Hartshorne and May's celebrated studies of honesty among schoolchildren:

The stan- dard interpretation of their results (Doris, 2002; Emler, 1999; Ross {\&} Nisbett, 1991) has been that children are typically dishonest when given the opportunity, even those students who were rated as honest by peers and teachers. Because many students exploited experimenter contrived opportunities for dishonesty, these authors con- cluded that situational factors were more impor- tant for moral behavior than character. This interpretation has been extremely influential. 

Reinterpretation: results have been subsequently reinterpreted theoretically and empir- ically. Virtue theory does not suggest that the majority of adult individuals will act virtuously in all situations, much less the majority of chil- dren. The finding that some children acted hon- estly in spite of incentives not to, suggests the presence of a character strength. Statistical re- analyses have also cast doubt on Hartshorne and May's conclusions


This recent upsurge of theoretical and empir-
ical interest in virtue and the good life demon- strates a waxing interest in these topics. Unfor- tunately, the vast majority of authors in this emerging literature in psychology has only a rudimentary and fragmented understanding of the rich theory available on virtue and the good life (Fowers, 2005, 2008, 2010a).


Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics:
Euidaimonia: the highest form of human life; hapiness or flourishing. What about excellence? (Brown 2012)

Aristotle understood eudaimonia as living a complete human life that is fully realized through virtuous activity (5)

"The first and most basic point about eudaimonia is that it is an inextricably ethical concept because it is about living the best kind of life" (6)

This formulation, wherein a being's good is a matter of the full expression of its nature, is known as the function argument. Throughout the NE, Aristotle emphasized that eudaimonia is a form of activity.1


Aristotle on Activity of eudaimonia: 

Throughout the NE, Aristotle emphasized that eudaimonia is a form of activity:

eudaimonia is a way of living and cannot be limited to a mental state or process.


Through most of the NE, Aristotle describes rational,
social, and political activity as it takes place in everyday life. In part of Book X of the NE, however, he discusses contemplation as the highest human activity. There is a good deal of controversy regarding how this concept is to be integrated into the rest of Aristotle's account of eudaimonia. I have downplayed this concept and the controversy here because it is beyond the scope of this special issue due to its complexity. For more on this fascinating, but vexing ques- tion, see Broadie (1991), Nussbaum (1986), and Rorty (1980).

a good human life is inextricably tied to being a good person. This is one of the key reasons that eudaimonia cannot be studied in a value-neutral way. Aristotle also saw eudaimonia as inherently pleasant because excellent activity is pleasant. He distinguished noble pleasures (e.g., learning) from base plea- sures (e.g., gluttony), but he clearly saw both virtuous activity and a eudaimonic life as deeply pleasurable (6)

there is nothing that can be added to a flourishing life to make it better

Finally, eudaimonia is comprised by a complete life, meaning that eudaimonia is a matter of how one's life comes together as a whole rather than being comprised of a series of transitory states such as emotions, moods, or experiences.

Broadie (1991) put it simply: “an excellence or virtue . . . is nothing but a characteristic which makes the difference between functioning and functioning well” (p. 37, emphasis in original). The capacities to act generously, loyally, courageously, and justly allow individuals to fulfill their potential as the rational social beings we are.

Individuals who have developed good character want to act ethically out of an attachment to what is good},

In this paper, I question whether the timing of their analysis is appropriate given that work on eudaimonic constructs has begun only recently. In an effort to increase the clarity regarding points at issue, both conceptual and operational definitions of hedonia and eudaimonia as two conceptions of happiness are analyzed along with definitions of four conceptions of well-being (subjective, hedonic, psychological, and eudaimonic), and both hedonism and eudaimonism as ethical philosophies. Responses are provided to numerous points in the Kashdan et al. (2008) critique including their claims that work from a eudaimonic perspective (1) does not fully capture the philosophical roots of eudaimonia, (2) is overly abstract, (3) lacks clarity at the point of operationalization and measurement, (4) is overly complex thus preventing meaningful scientific inquiry, (5) provides evidence only for quantitative, not qualitative, differences, (6) is potentially elitist, and (7) misrepresents the moral standing of hedonia and eudaimonia. Evidence is presented in support of the view that hedonia and eudaimonia represent inter-related but reliably distinguishable and qualitatively distinct conceptions of happiness making independent contributions to an array of outcome variables. A set of recommendations is advanced as to how theory-building and empirical research can be strengthened in light of the multiple conceptualizations of happiness and well-being now current in the literature.

abstract = {Interest in eudaimonia (e.g., growth, meaning, authenticity, excellence) and its distinction from hedonia (e.g., pleasure, enjoyment, comfort, absence of distress) is growing rapidly, as researchers recognize that both concepts are central to the study of well-being. Yet research on these concepts faces challenges as well: findings based on different operationalizations can be quite discrepant; definitions of eudaimonia and hedonia sometimes fall into different categories of analysis (e.g. when eudaimonia is described as a way of functioning, hedonia as an experience); and the terms eudaimonia and hedonia are sometimes defined vaguely or applied to concepts that may be mere correlates. To aid in addressing these challenges, we propose the following terminology and classification for discussing conceptual and operational definitions: (1) degree of centrality—differentiating concepts that are core (i.e., definitional), close-to-core (i.e., given some attention but not central), and major correlates; (2) category of analysis—identifying which of the following categories a definition represents: (a) orientations (orientations, values, motives, and goals), (b) behaviors (behavioral content, activity characteristics), (c) experiences (subjective experiences, emotions, cognitive appraisals), (d) functioning (indices of positive psychological functioning, mental health, flourishing); and (3) level of measurement—identifying whether a definition is used for trait and/or state comparisons. The work of scholars with a program of research on eudaimonia or the distinction between eudaimonia and hedonia is reviewed and discussed within the framework of the proposed classification; several points of convergence and divergence across definitions are highlighted; and important questions and directions for future research are identified.},

Challenges:
1. multiplicity of conceptual and operational definitions
2. Potential asymmetry in hedonia and eudaimonia
3. Looseness of useage


Philosophical foundations for empirical investigations of Hed and Eud:
Philosophers have advanced multiple perspectives as to what constitutes well-being and how any given element of human functioning can be said to be an aspect of it (1427)

(a) subjective state theories (Bentham 1781; John Stuart Mill 1861/1979), (b) desire ful- fillment theories (Griffin 1986; Heathwood 2006), 
(c) life-satisfaction theories (Sumner 1996; Tiberius and Hall 2010), 
(d) objective list theories (Arneson 2007; Gert 1998), and 
(e) nature fulfillment theories (Aristotle, 4th century B.C.E./1985; Kraut 2007; Norton 1976).

Both eud and hed are elements of an ethical philosophy that answer
questions regarding the nature of a good life or a life well-lived (1427)

Hedonia: the focus is happiness as pleasure, enjoyment, and absence of discomfort
Eudaimonia: focus is on activity reflecting virtue, excellence, the best within us, and the full development of our potentials (e.g., Annas 1993; Norton 1976; Tiberius and Hall 2010)

According to the classical understanding of eudaimonia, the term was not intended to refer to a subjective state but to what was worth pursuing in life

Within philosophy, hedonism and eudaimonism are competing ethical theories addressing questions as to how one ought to live.

from a contemporary psychological perspective it is theoretically plausible to posit that there is a distinctive set of subjective experiences (and aspects of functioning) that accompany the pursuit of that which is worthwhile, and that they are distinguishable from pleasure in the hedonic meaning of that term.

While such experiences are strongly positive, from a eudaimonic perspective, they are not the goal to be pursued but rather a by-product of the pursuit of virtue, excellence, and the best within us, and/or an indication that one is having some success in that regard

pursuit of both hedonia and eudaimonia should produce greater well-being than either pursuit alone (Huta and Ryan 2010; Peterson et al. 2005).

3. Challenges in the Eud/Hed Literature

3.1 The Multiplicity of Definitions and Discrepancies in Research Findings

Discrepencies in correlation with eud/hed well-being, and eud well-being and "life satisfaction"
Variance in trait and state definitions of eud well-being

3.2 Asymmetries in the Study of Eudaimonia and Hedonia

Hedonia: cognitive-affective experiences e.g., positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, happiness, enjoyment),

eudaimonia: positive mental functioning or orientations (e.g., self-actualization, maturity, openness to experience, value congruency, commitment, as well as Ryff's concepts including personal growth and purpose in life)

While the factor analyses have made valuable contributions, it is unclear to what degree they arrived at separate factors because of a distinction between eudaimonia and hedonia rather than a distinction between cognitive-affect experiences and indices of functioning and orientations.

3.3 Looseness of Treatment of Eudaimonia and Hedonia

3.4 Proposed classification system:

1. Degree of centrality: 
/core: essential to the meaning of eud/hed, 



/close-to-core: 



/correlates: consequences, antecedents, or concomitants of eudaimonia or hedonia






2. Category of analysis:

a. Orientations: orientations, values, motives, and goals, i.e., the ‘‘why'' of behavior.

variables that organize the direction of a person's behaviors
studied as outcomes of various influence
Conceptually, they are subjectively experienced and engaged in by the individual;
operationally, they are typically assessed with self-report, though they can sometimes be inferred from other methods such as behavioral observation
orientations represent the aims and priorities a person habitually
pursues



b. Behaviors: behavioral content and activity characteristics, i.e., the ‘‘what'' of behavior.

Conceptually, the variables in this category of analysis range from subjective (e.g., degree of personal commitment to the activity) to fairly objective (e.g., how much skill one brings to the activity)

Operationally, subjective activity characteristics and contents are usually assessed with self-reports, while more objective activity characteristics and contents can be appraised either by the participant or by methods such as observer ratings or scores on a performance measure


c. Experiences: subjective experiences, emotions, and cognitive appraisals.

Conceptually, this category of analysis is highly subjective; operationally, it is most directly assessed through self-report.


d. Functioning: indices of positive psychological functioning, mental health, and flourishing

Conceptually, this category is often a blend of objective (e.g., environmental mastery) and subjective (e.g., self-acceptance) features, and is amenable to operational assessment through self-report or methods such as observer ratings or performance scores

3. Level of measurement: trait/state comparisons

The Trait Level:
typical average degree of hed/eud, stable but not immutable (can evolve over time).

The State Level:
within a restricted time period or a particular type of activity


Researchers:

1. Alan Waterman (1993, 2011): 

eudaimonic identity theory
adopts an individual nature fulfillment philosophical perspective, placing self-realization as a core defining element of eudaimonia: personal best potentials are associated with personal expressiveness. Self-realization—(functioning)—is the more important of these constructs as it is integral to the nature of a life well-lived.
personal expressiveness (experiences) serve as a signal that one is acting in a way consistent with one's intrinsic nature and serve to reinforce such actions
near-core: authenticity, purpose and meaning in life, and dedicated effort in the pursuit of excellence
correlates: mental health qualities that others place as core to eud. (self-accep-tance, positive social relationships, and societal contributions)

Hedonia:
subjective experiences of enjoyment and life-satisfaction (natural concomitants of attaining reasonable success with respect to self-realization) 

The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ; Waterman 1993) was designed to assess these constructs as states when engaged in self-defining activities State-level measurement

Questionnaire for Eudaimonic Well-Being (QEWB; Waterman et al. 2010):
Eudaimonic functioning at the trait level: 
(a) self-discovery, 
(b) perceived development of one's best potentials, 
(c) a sense of purpose and meaning-in-life, 
(d) investment of significant effort in the pursuit of excellence, 
(e) intense involvement in activities, and 
(f) enjoyment of activities as personally expressive.

Research Program:
1. identify consistent patterns of significant differences in the relative strength of state-level experiences of eudaimonia (feelings of personal expressiveness) and hedonic enjoyment in correlation with variables pertaining to intrinsic motivation. 
2. Waterman et al. (2010, 2012) established the construct validity of the QEWB as an instrument for assessing eudaimonic well-being

2. Carol Ryff

Eudaimonia concept: trait psychological well-being, to be fully functioning, and to succeed in the face of life's existential challenges (Ryff and Singer 2008)

six characteristics as core to eudaimonia (Scales for Psychological Well-being (Ryff 1989): 
(a) self-acceptance, 
(b) positive relations with others, 
(c) personal growth, 
(d) purpose in life, 
(e) environmental mastery, and 
(f) autonomy. 
(functioning)

hedonia: not a focus. subjective experiences of well-being, specifically life satisfaction, contentment, and positive affect (Ryff and Singer 2008).

Research:
theoretical perspective on eudaimonia as psychological well-being and the Scales of Psychological Well-Being
examination of the psychosocial and sociodemographic correlates of eudaimonic functioning (Ryff and Singer 2008), 
continuing concern for the biological underpinnings of psychological well-being and its relationship to health throughout the lifespan (Friedman and Ryff 2012a, b; Morozink et al. 2010; Ryff 2013; Ryff et al. 2004).

3. Corey Keyes

Eudaimonia: combination of psychological well-being and social well-being (2002). markers for psychological well-being are the same as those utilized by Ryff (1989). social well-being are identified as:
social acceptance, 
social actualization, 
social contribution, 
social coherence, 
and social integration.

Hedonia: emotional well-being life satisfaction, level of happiness, and presence of positive affect (experiences)

Mental Health Continuum for assessing psychological, social, and emotional well-being (2002, 2006) trait-level:
6 scales for psychological well-being,
5 scales for social well-being,
3 scales for emotional well-being, 
(it is possible to identify the correlations among scales and the relative strength of their associations with other variables (Robitschek and Keyes 2009))

Keyes' model of flourishing: feeling good (hedonic happiness) and functioning well (eudaimonic happiness) are distinctive, both conceptually and phe- notypically (Keyes et al. 2002; Keyes and Simoes 2012)
- Functioning well is seen as adding to, and often accounting for, the predictive power of hedonia

Research:
-Keyes et al. (2010) have demonstrated that a single, highly heritable genetic factor underlies psychological, social, and emotional well-being.
- establishing a two continua model for mental health and illness (Keyes 2002, 2005; Westerhoff and Keyes 2010)
importance of social well-being, in terms of the five aspects of social functioning listed above, as integral to optimal functioning (1998) (core)

a continuum from languishing to flourishing incorporating indices of all three forms of well-being

4. Blaine Fowers

Eudaimonia: 
life that is centrally focused on activities that are constitutive (worthy and meaningful in themselves, and consistent with one's values, commitments, and self-identity), with instrumental activities (a means to an end) having a secondary role.
eudaimonic life is devoted to characteristically human goods (e.g., knowledge, beauty, justice, belonging), pursued with excellence or virtue, and within collaborative relationships, and thus is a life of flourishing (a life of meaning and purpose, personal growth, and positive relationships) (Fowers 2012a; Fowers et al. 2010).
(orientations, behaviors, and functioning)

Hedonia:
experiences of high positive affect, low negative affect, and high life satisfaction (Fowers et al. 2010)

Trait level measurement: virtues
Orientations: Constitutive Goal Orientation subscale of the Goal Orientations Scales (Fowers et al. 2010) is used to measure the degree to which key actions a person undertakes to pursue important personal goals are integral to those goals
Functioning: three of the Scales of Psychological Well- Being (Ryff 1989)—Personal Growth, Purpose in Life, and Positive Relations With Others—to operationalize what Fowers refers to as eudaimonic well-being

(Behaviour): Integrity subscale of the Personal Project Matrix (Palys and Little 1983) and the Personal Expressiveness subscale of the Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire—Standard Form (Waterman 1993) Mediating between constitutive goal orientation and eudaimonic well-being is a constitutive mode of goal pursuit.
This concern may also represent a 5th category of analysis, as it deals with the "how" of behaviour

Research:
Aristotle's virtue ethics
and psychology (e.g., Fowers and Richardson 1996; Fowers 2001, 2005; Fowers 2008, 2012a, b).
key empirical paper contrasting eudai- monia and hedonia is Fowers et al. (2010)

5. Richard Ryan {\&} Edward Deci:

Eudaimonia: pursuing intrinsic goals and values as ends in themselves, including personal growth, relationships, community contribution, and physical health; being autonomously motivated; behaving in mindful ways; and satisfying needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Ryan et al. 2008)
Humans are seen as growing towards a level of functioning where they are autonomous and living out their potentialities to the fullest (Ryan et al. 2013)
Autonomy includes experiences of volition, willingness, interest, and choice, and is accompanied by feelings of vitality (Nix et al. 1999; Ryan and Deci 2006).
conception of eudaimonia spans all four categories of analysis, though it is primarily focused on orientations.

Hedonia: life of pleasure and subjective well-being, i.e., positive affect, life satisfaction, and low negative affect (Ryan et al. 2008). (experiences)

Trait level of measurement:
Self-Determination Theory (SDT)
General Causality Orientations Scale (Deci and Ryan 1985). 
A brief scale to assess the degree to which a person pursues specific intrinsic goals (societal contribution, self-acceptance and personal growth, and intimacy and friendship) was developed by Sheldon and Kasser (1995)
scale to measure intrinsic aspirations (affiliation, community contribution, competence and autonomy, and physical health) appears in Grouzet et al. (2005)
Mindfulness is assessed in SDT research using the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan 2003)
Feeling that one's psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness have been met through one's behaviors can be assessed by the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (Gagne 2003).

Research:
SDT research has been ongoing since the early 1970s (Deci 1971)
explicitly linked with the concept of eudaimonia until 2001 when Ryan and Deci wrote a review of the well-being literature (2001) which demonstrated that eudaimonia and hedonia represent two of the main conceptualizations of well-being

6. Martin Seligman

Eudaimonia: identifying one's unique virtues and strengths of character, developing them, and then using them in the service of greater goods, particularly the welfare of humankind (Seligman 2002; Peterson et al. 2005) 
(Orientations)

Seligman views concepts such as engagement and flow as representing an orientation to happiness that is distinct from eudaimonia, whereas some other researchers treat engagement and flow as part of the eudaimonia concept 

Hedonia: defined primarily as maximizing pleasure, though minimizing pain is also discussed (Seligman 2002; Peterson et al. 2005). The definition again falls in the orien- tations category of analysis.

Trait level measurement: Orientations to Happiness subscales (Peterson et al. 2005):
Eudaimonia: Life of Meaning subscale, which includes items assessing a concern with societal contribution and meaning/ purpose
Hedonia: Life of Pleasure subscale, which consists of items assessing a focus on pleasure
A third subscale, the Life of Engagement, is considered by Seligman to be distinct from eudaimonia

Research: 
- Introduced perspective in 2002, 
- In 2005, Peterson and colleagues published the key empirical paper which employed this perspective. Over 15 studies have been published since, including an intervention study (Giannopoulos and Vella- Brodrick 2011), and several cross-cultural studies studying links with well-being and char- acter strengths (Peterson et al. 2007; Vella-Brodrick et al. 2009; Park et al. 2009)
- Seligman (2011) expanded his conception of the basis of well-being to include five elements: not only 
Meaning, 
Engagement, and 
Positive emotions, but also positive 
Relationships and Accomplishment, which together are summarized by the acronym PERMA

7. Joar Vitters{\o}

Eudaimonia: degree to which activities are experienced as engaging and interesting and associated with flow (Vitters{\o} 2013a, b) (experiences)
- openness to experience as an aspect of positive psychological functioning (Vitters{\o} 2004).
- preference for complexity, curiosity, engagement/ flow, personal growth, and competence, and to some extent meaning/purpose in life, self- actualization, and excellence (Vitters{\o} et al. 2009)
eudaimonic orientation, a tendency to seek out challenge and complexity (Vitters{\o} et al. 2010).

Hedonia: whether activities are experienced as being pleasant or associated with feeling happy, but also includes the more global concept of life-satisfaction (Vitters{\o} et al. 2009).

Measurement: 
Basic Emotion Trait Test and Basic Emotion State Test to assess pleasure, engagement/interest, and other emotions
trait eudaimonia: Flow Simplex- degree to which a person is located near the flow sector on a circumplex of emotions (Vitters{\o} et al. 2001)
Personal Growth Composite which consists of four previously existing scales assessing curiosity, engagement/flow, preference for complexity, and competence (Vitters{\o} et al. 2009)

Research: 
demonstrating the different patterns of associations for hedonic and eudaimonic well-being,
- Specifically, the idea that experiences of pleasure and evaluations of life satisfaction relate to the maintenance of stability and homeostasis whereas experiences of engagement/interest relate to personal growth and the management of complex changes and developments in life (Vitters{\o} 2003, 2004, 2013a, b; Vitters{\o} et al. 2009; Vitters{\o} and S{\o}holt 2011)
distinguished between pleasure and interest with respect to work experiences, specifically perceived job control (Kopperud and Vitterso 2008; Straume and Vitters{\o} 2012) and with respect to replaying or analyzing a happy life moment (Vitters{\o} et al. 2009).

8. Jack Bauer

Eudaimonia:
orientation: personal narratives where a person shows that they value and are motivated towards goals of personal growth.
functioning and experience: eudaimonic growth as an increase in both ego development/maturity and subjective well-being over time (thus, his conception of eudaimonia also encompasses the experience of subjective well-being, which most other researchers associate only with hedonia) (Bauer et al. 2008)
maturity or excellence of personal character as being self-aware, and transcending self-interest to be able to see oneself as interdependent, to take others' per- spectives, to think in terms of long-term consequences, and to understand things in more abstract, more complex, and deeper terms (Bauer 2008; Bauer et al. 2011) building on Loevinger's (1976) stages of ego-development
Ryff's psychological well-being as another way of conceptualizing eudaimonia, referring to it as an index of meaningfulness or satisfaction with one's personal growth and various sources of meaning (Bauer and Park 2010)

Hedonia: the pure experience of subjective well-being (Bauer et al. 2008). 

trait level of measurement: 
Ego development is operationalized using Hy and Loevinger's (1996) Sentence Completion Test of Ego Development participants provide paragraph descriptions of major personal goals or life transitions, and these are then coded for the presence of themes such as interest in agentic growth and communal growth (Bauer and McAdams 2004a).

Psychological well-being is operationalized using Ryff's (1989) six scales (Bauer and McAdams 2004a, b)

Research:
intrinsic growth goals (personal growth, meaningful rela- tionships, and contributing to society) were more associated with eudaimonic well-being (Ryff's psychological well-being) than with hedonic well-being (life satisfaction) (Bauer et al},

abstract = {Emotions have been shown to play a critical role in health outcomes, but research on this topic has been limited to studies in industrialized countries, which prevents broad generalizations. This study assessed whether emotion-health connections persist across various regions, including less-developed countries, where the degree to which people's fundamental needs are met might be a better predictor of physical well-being. Individuals from 142 countries (N = 150,048) were surveyed about their emotions, health, hunger, shelter, and threats to safety. Both positive and negative emotions exhibited unique, moderate effects on self-reported health, and together, they accounted for 46.1{\%} of the variance. These associations were stronger than the relative impact of hunger, homelessness, and threats to safety and were not simply attributable to countries' gross domestic products (GDPs). Furthermore, connections between positive emotion and health were stronger in low-GDP countries than in high-GDP countries. Our findings suggest that emotion matters for health around the globe and may in fact be more critical in less-developed areas.},

abstract = {This study investigated an Aristotelian model of eudaimonic and hedonic well-being that distinguishes between goal orientations in which the means and ends are separable (instrumental) and in which the means and ends are inherently related (constitutive). Eudaimonic well-being was expected to be related to constitutive goal orientation and hedonic well-being was expected to be related to both constitutive and instrumental goal orientation. Personal identification with activities was expected to mediate the relationship between constitutive goal orientation and eudaimonic well-being. Personal enjoyment was expected to mediate the relationship between instrumental goal orientation and hedonic well-being. Factor analysis supported the independence of constitutive and instrumental goal orientation measures. As predicted, SEM results suggested that there were independent pathways to eudaimonic and hedonic well-being, with strong mediation in both pathways. Results were consistent with Aristotle's [Aristotle (1999). The Nicomachean ethics (M. Ostwald, Trans.).

abstract = {The awakening cortisol response (ACR) is a discrete and distinctive part of the cortisol circadian cycle. In healthy adults salivary free cortisol concentrations increase by between 50 and 160{\%} in the first 30 min immediately post-awakening (approximate average increase of 9 nmol/l, range 4-15 nmol/l, estimated to be equivalent to about three secretory episodes). However there are no agreed norms for the absolute concentrations of free cortisol in saliva either immediately post-awakening (range of 4.7-18.5 nmol/l) or 30 min post-awakening (range of 8.6-21.9 nmol/l). This review explores reasons for these discrepancies in normative data including confounding factors such as gender, age, awakening time, light and participant adherence. Although the physiological role of the ACR has not been clearly defined evidence is discussed that suggests it is under a distinct regulatory influence, different from the rest of the diurnal cortisol secretory cycle. Despite the difficulties associated with its measurement a range of studies have demonstrated an association between the ACR and psychosocial variables, stress and health. However it remains unclear whether positive affect and good health are consistently associated with larger or smaller awakening responses. It is early days in the search for the role and significance of the ACR. Its putative role in the regulation of physiological function across the day (e.g. the immune system) and its sensitivity to psychosocial variables make it a prime candidate as an intermediary linking mind and health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasingly, researchers attend to both positive and negative aspects of mental health. Such distinctions call for clarification of whether psychological well-being and ill-being comprise opposite ends of a bipolar continuum, or are best construed as separate, independent dimensions of mental health. Biology can help resolve this query--bipolarity predicts 'mirrored' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being correlate similarly with biomarkers, but show opposite directional signs), whereas independence predicts 'distinct' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being have different biological signatures).

METHODS: Multiple aspects of psychological well-being (eudaimonic, hedonic) and ill-being (depression, anxiety, anger) were assessed in a sample of aging women (n = 135, mean age = 74) on whom diverse neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, DHEA-S) and cardiovascular factors (weight, waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin) were also measured.

RESULTS: Measures of psychological well-being and ill-being were significantly linked with numerous biomarkers, with some associations being more strongly evident for respondents aged 75+. Outcomes for seven biomarkers supported the distinct hypothesis, while findings for only two biomarkers supported the mirrored hypothesis.

CONCLUSION: This research adds to the growing literature on how psychological well-being and mental maladjustment are instantiated in biology. Population-based inquiries and challenge studies constitute important future directions.},

Study 1 found greater postinteraction closeness with these tasks versus comparable small-talk tasks. Studies 2 and 3 found no significant closeness effects, inspite of adequate power, for (a) whether pairs were matched for nondisagreement on important attitudes, (b) whether pairs were led to expect mutual liking, or (c) whether getting close was made an explicit goal. These studies also illustrated applications for addressing theoretical issues, yielding provocative tentative findings relating to attachment style and introversion/extraversion.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-as a state, trait, process, type of meditation, and intervention has proven to be beneficial across a diverse group of psychological disorders as well as for general stress reduction. Yet, there remains a lack of clarity in the operationalization of this construct, and underlying mechanisms. Here, we provide an integrative theoretical framework and systems-based neurobiological model that explains the mechanisms by which mindfulness reduces biases related to self-processing and creates a sustainable healthy mind. Mindfulness is described through systematic mental training that develops meta-awareness (self-awareness), an ability to effectively modulate one's behavior (self-regulation), and a positive relationship between self and other that transcends self-focused needs and increases prosocial characteristics (self-transcendence). This framework of self-awareness, -regulation, and -transcendence (S-ART) illustrates a method for becoming aware of the conditions that cause (and remove) distortions or biases. The development of S-ART through meditation is proposed to modulate self-specifying and narrative self-networks through an integrative fronto-parietal control network. Relevant perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral neuropsychological processes are highlighted as supporting mechanisms for S-ART, including intention and motivation, attention regulation, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation, prosociality, non-attachment, and decentering. The S-ART framework and neurobiological model is based on our growing understanding of the mechanisms for neurocognition, empirical literature, and through dismantling the specific meditation practices thought to cultivate mindfulness. The proposed framework will inform future research in the contemplative sciences and target specific areas for development in the treatment of psychological disorders.},
annote = {Two models for cultivating mindfulness in the context of meditation practice:



1. 2500yr old Buddhist science - historical model
2. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) (Kabat-Zinn 1990) - contemporary model




"Mindfulness is described as 
(1) A temporary state of non-judgmental, non-reactive, present-centered attention and awareness that is cultivated during meditation practice; 
(2) An enduring trait that can be described as a dispositional pattern of cognition, emotion, or behavioral tendency; 
(3) A meditation practice; 
(4) An intervention" (1).




---{\textgreater} Mindfulness can be conceived using a conceptual frame-work of self-processing (2).




reduction in distortions and biases of perception/cognition/emotion in order to achieve 




SELF - 
AWARENESS {\textgreater} (meta-awareness of self)
REGULATION {\textgreater} (alter one's responses and impulses)
TRANSCENDENCE {\textgreater} (positive relationship between self and other that transcends self-focussed needs and inreases prosocial characteristics) (2)




Etymology of mindfulness:




Sanskirt "bhavana": cultivation, causing to become, or "development of familiarity" (Tibetan) (2).




{\#}plucktheday: "mental development, in which the practitioner is cultivating a general sense of well-being and virtue along with a level of deep familiarity with one's inner mental landscape, and one's patterns of behavior (i.e., nature of mind)" (2).




connection between functions of memory and attention: (2)




"the continuous discriminative attentional capacity for encoding and recollecting experiences efficiently—without forgetfulness or dis- traction, and in the appropriate context" (2)




In the Buddhist context, Experience (suffering) consists of:




1. Habitual craving or attachment (to sensory/mental objects we like) and/or aversion (to sen- sory/mental objects we don't like); 
2. All phenomena (including the concept of self) are impermanent (they arise and pass away). 




These characteristics of experience are based on an inflated sense of self-importance or self-loathing (Thera, 1962) (2)




Mindfulness proposes four key qualities to reduce suffering:
1.A balanced intensity of effort and diligence (Pali: ¯atapi),
2. Wisdom of clear discernment or phenomenal clarity (Pali: sampajana), 
3.Mindful awareness, and 
4.Freedom from desire
and discontent (Pali: vineyya loke abhijjh¯
a-domanassa.m), a formof equanimity (2)







Equanimity is translated as“onlooking” or “watching things as they arise” and is described to involve a balance of arousal without hyperexcitability or fatigue (Buddhaghosa, 1991) (2). 




Qualities like equanimity and clarity 




develop over time




along with mindful awareness, while one learns to neither suppress nor fixate on what is arising in sen- sory experience moment to moment. 




Perceiving objects "as they truly are" without biases or distortions inherent in cognition (2) --{\textgreater} "Bare Attention"; perception without interpretation, 




The four qualities, including mindful awareness, critically facilitate the development of an advanced self-monitoring system that is the first essential step to S-ART—gaining awareness of suffering as it is described herein (2-3).





Ethics of mindfulness:



Emphasis from most traditional texts has also been on ethicalconduct (Pali: Sila) and ethical dimensions ofmindfulness so that actions along the path of reduced suffering continually remain “wholesome” (3).
Universal love and compassion for all living beings




The cultivation of ethical qualities (e.g., loving-kindness, compassion, forgiveness) through specific forms of meditation practices are also described to supplement these two core practices (Goldstein, 1976;Wallace, 2006; Lutz et al., 2007; Salzberg, 2011):




1.Focused Attention (FA) and 
2.Open Monitoring (OM)




"once the practitioner is able to stabilize the mind, decrease mental proliferation (i.e., rumination), and develop a fully absorbed state of concentration on an object like the breath using FA, he/she can move on to OM and other more advanced receptive practices that have no object of focus, but rather are receptive to all other physical and mental phenomena that arise" (3)




"Such absorptive states cultivate an experience of non-duality between subject-object relations, is thought to be experienced with joy and elation, and is associated with strong decreases in craving (aversion) for positive (negative) states" (4)




---{\textgreater} "This is it" this is how life should be. this describes a state that is neither hedonic nor dyphoric, but simply "is", and is in a way that is good, morally good, harmonious, embodied, holistic."
---{\textgreater} this may link to the integration of the systems that produce sensations




"To achieve the 10th stage of samatha apparently requires an exceptionally high level of mastery, which could take years of training and upwards of 10,000 h of formal practice (Wallace, 2006)" (4). 







Effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBIs):



"The successes of MBIs have been measured in termsof decreasingclinical symptomsand improvingoverall mental health and well-being. The changes are based on the gen- eral framework of a manualized 8-week program of meditation and gentle Hatha yoga training, including 26 h of formal instruc- tion (8 classes/2.5-h/ea.), variable amount of meditation time at home (45min/day; averages reported of 246 min/week), plus an all-day 6-h class during the 6 week (in some cases half-day) (Carmody and Baer, 2009).




"there have been reported improvements in clinical symptoms and executive function in short-term training of spe- cific mindfulness-based practices as short as three 20 min sessions (Zeidan et al., 2010) and changes in white matter connectivity after 11 h of training (Tang et al., 2010)."











Dispositional mindfulness is currently measured by at least eight scales (4):



-FFMQ
Factorial analysis has resulted in five facets of mindfulness:




1.OBSERVING: An enhanced capacity for noticing or attending to internal and external experiences 
2.DESCRIBING An enhanced capacity for noting and labeling internal experiences (feelings, images, and thoughts;
3. acting with AWARENESS: An enhanced capacity for acting with present-centered awareness rather than on “automatic pilot”—lost in the past or the future
4. NON- JUDGEMENT: An enhanced ability to take a non-evaluative, non-judgmental stance toward inner thoughts, images, and feelings and outer experiences 
5. NON-REACTIVITY: An enhanced ability to allow thoughts, images, and feelings to come and go without reacting to them or getting carried away by them (5).








Self-report scales are inconclusive, and many issues associatede with them are as yet unresolved (5).







Operationalizing mindfulness into distinct cognitive-neuro-psycho-social processes or proposing a conceptual mechanistic model (5):







Existing models emphasise the following themes:
1. Apresent-centered orientation of awareness
2. An attitude that consists of a constellation of positive state-like qualities (open-hearted, non-judgmental; accepting) toward thoughts and feelings; 
3. A positive intention or motivational component for clinical change or spiritual incentive; 
4. Development of a form of decentering or psychological distancing from one's thoughts and emotions.




Holzel et al. (2011a) identified very specific component mechanisms by which mindfulness functions, including attention and emotion regula- tion, body awareness, and a change in the perspective on the self.







Biased Self-Processing:










Bias: "...the tendency or extent to which emotional stimuli with either a negative or positive valence may be processed differently in comparison to neutral material" (5)




--one of the goals of mindfulness-based practice is to make no such distinction between positive, negative, or neu- tral valence and treat all incoming stimuli with impartiality and equipoise (5)


















Affect-biased attention:














affect-biased attention is associated with distortions in initial attention allocation toward momentary experience and/or subsequent information process- ing that either follows immediately after an emotional stimulus or is associated with real or imagined stimuli fromthe past or distant future (5).












The capture of perceptual resources by a given stimulus is influenced not only by the characteristics of the stimulus itself, but also by higher control systems acting upon the representations of stimuli (5)












Attentional selection is therefore determined by the outcome of competition between these multiple and potentially “biased” representations of the world and of one's perception of self in relation to the world" (5).







Engagement: enhanced tendency to orient and select a given stimulus or location for processing (5)




Facilitated engagement may translate to hypervigilance or enhanced monitoring and artificially increased perception of threat in everyday experiences, the consequence of which is that all threatening stimuli (real or imagined) attract attention, consuming resources and affecting sensory-perceptual systems before there is full subjective awareness (Mathews and Mackintosh, 1998).












avoidance




refers to both automatic and strategic forms of emotion regulation in which elaborative or evaluative processing is reduced and threat value is deflated












Disengagement delays




are similar to what meditation practitioners refer to as “mental stickiness” and describes our nat- ural tendency to dedicate resources to an object of engagement to the extent that few resources remain to capture any other per- tinent environmental information until one is able to disengage (“let go”) and re-orient.












Over time, hypervigilance, avoidance, and disengagement delays can become habitual, contextually self- relevant, and highly crystalized sensory-affective-motor scripts and schemas that dictate tendencies toward behavior















...causally influencing and maintaining disordered affective states such as anxiety and depression. 








Disengagement: selection and facilitated processing is withdrawn or inhibited (5)




Beck (1964): “...the processing of external events or internal stimuli is biased and therefore systematically distorts the indi- vidual's construction of his or her experiences, leading to a variety of errors (e.g., overgeneralization, selective abstraction, personalization) (6)




“...the processing of external events or internal stimuli is biased and therefore systematically distorts the indi- vidual's construction of his or her experiences, leading to a variety of errors (e.g., overgeneralization, selective abstraction, personalization). Underlying these distorted interpretations are dysfunctional beliefs incorporated into relatively enduring cog- nitive structures or schemas” (Beck, 2008)












"Formation of dysfunctional attitudes incorporated within cognitive schemas produce automatized, efficient implicit memories, and motor programs that represent skewed informa- tion processing fromearly perceptual stages to the cognitive interpretation (Beck, 1976, 2008)" (6).




When these maladaptive scripts and schemas are active repeatedly throughout one's daily life, it can lead to rumination or mental proliferation, in which a stream of mental events feed off each other with no connection to the original sense impression that initiated the stream of thought. Ruminative behavior is often characterized as reducing information processing capacity, producing general interference effects with ongoing task demands, and impacting ability to deploy top-down control (Yiend, 2010) (6):












Over-activity of the executive cortical functions of the brain in a circular fashion disconnected from the original stimuli - irrational? this type of activity resembles the irrational emotional realm of attachment and compliance etc...


















"This impact on informa- tion processing capacity also colors the emotional tone of one's ongoing experience, reducing the opportunity for awareness of one'sthoughtsor patternsof behavior in responsetoparticular contextual triggers" (6)




"At each repeated exposure to the individual contextual features of any biased self-schema, there is a hypothesized non-conscious pattern completion of the entire dysfunctional system that facilitates habitual forms of processing and blocks novel interpretations about oneself (e.g., positively framed memories and self-schemas) and the external sensory world (e.g., efficient engagement and disengagement)" (6)

















Networks for Self-Processing that support S-ART:






1. Self-Specifying processes:
- Experiential Enactive Self (EES): Non-conscious sensory-affective-motor processing, 


"Current research suggests non-conscious processes related to self/identity involve repeated associative conditioning of interactions between the body, the environment, and the processes involving exteroception, proprio- ception, kinesthesia, and interoception" (7)


Leading to a " self-specifying sensory-motor convergence " (8)


P: "State-dependent, sustained functional activation of the EES network is likely to represent embodied enaction to support the phenomenological awareness of sensory and mental activity and regulation of attention so mind wandering is less frequent" (8)


F: In a number of studies, experienced meditators (in contrast to non-meditators) were found to have increased BOLD-related activity in areas related to EES during FA/OM or similar meditation practices (8)


F: In a similar population of med- itators, morphological increases in gray matter (GM) volume and concentration were found in areas related to EES (8)


F: One study found that activation in EES-specific areas...negatively correlated with individual depression scores, supporting a role formindfulness in homeostatic and motor function-specific regulation of emotion (Farb et al., 2010) (8).










- Experiential Phenomenological Self (EPS): agentic, self-as-subject, awareness in the present moment.


the immediate subject of experience in the present and to taking a first person perspective (FPP) without reflection or evaluation (Tagini and Raffone, 2010) (8).


a form of higher order conscious, volitional awareness related to exteroceptive and interoceptive experience (8)


"this includes the immediate motivational, social, and affective feelings associated with experience, along with top-down attentional control mech- anisms found within attentional networks" (8)


"The right DLPFC and dorsal ACC (dACC) have been thought to act in an “executive” capacity for this system, such that they may be responsible for vigilance and alertness—monitoring performance or arousal levels and regulating them accordingly" (8)





The AIC: (9)

The AIC in humans is unique in that it is thought to integrate the higher order, social, emotional, moti- vational, and cognitive components of subjective feeling states through its strong functional and anatomical connectivity with the ACC, ventralmedial pre-frontal cortex (VMPFC), and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC).




This uniquely human aspect of process- ing high resolution interoceptive information places the AIC in a strong position to handle phenomenological experience related to conscious awareness and likely provides improved self-regulation and autonomic control (Gilbert et al., 2010)


Furthermore, AIC activation has been repeatedly shown to be inversely corre- lated with posteromedial cortex (PMC) [including precuneus, PCC, retrosplenial cortex (RSP)] in functional imaging studies of awareness and task-related attention (Craig, 2009). The PCC and RSP have more often been associated with the NS network, sug- gesting a mechanism for contrasting momentary awareness with self-reflection



Pain: so far mixed results
decreased activity in the PIC and somatosensory areas corresponding to the site of pain stimulus while meditating in the context of noxious stimuli. Interestingly, right AIC and dACC negatively correlated with pain intensity, while OFC activity neg- atively correlated with pain unpleasantness (Zeidan et al., 2011) (9)


These studies of acute pain suggest meditators modulate primary interoceptive pain processing (in comparison to controls) during pain experience and affective dimensions of pain processing are diminished (9).










2. Self-related processes:
-Narrative Self (NS): self-as-object, autobiographical projection of self into past-future narrative. 


"...an evaluative, reflective form of identification that fol- lows experience in narrative form, described in some contexts as the “Me-self” or “material me,” the sum total of all a person can call their own across physical, social, or psychological domains" (10)


reflected in metacognitive knowledge: 


There may very well be distinct substrates across each domain as there is likely distinct forms of “me-self” in as many social relationships as there are individuals who recognize each one uniquely (10)


awareness of a specific object, “me” to which identifica- tionwith, and evaluation of, specific characteristics are made (10)


repeated construction of identity in time and space through moment-to-moment episodic memory formation (Peters et al., 2009; Spreng et al., 2009). Through interactions between PMC and subcortical limbic structures (e.g., hippocam- pus, amygdala), there is a progressive accumulation of an “auto-biographical self,” a set of memories that make up the individual's unique past, current state, and expected future (Zelazo et al., 2007; Spreng et al., 2009).


Through an interaction with the sgACC, there is evidence suggesting a mechanism for appraising the value of stimuli with respect to current goals and decisions, while some data suggest a role in modulating emotion and disengagement through executive control mechanisms (Drevets et al., 2008; Roy et al., 2012). Increased NS activity during goal-directed tasks is often associated with excessive and repetitive elaboration or rumination, decreasing efficiency of the attentional systemand capacity of information processing in general, further supporting the claim that increased NS processing can lead to negative health outcomes (},

abstract = {Negative emotional stimuli activate a broad network of brain regions, including the medial prefrontal (mPFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) cortices. An early influential view dichotomized these regions into dorsal-caudal cognitive and ventral-rostral affective subdivisions. In this review, we examine a wealth of recent research on negative emotions in animals and humans, using the example of fear or anxiety, and conclude that, contrary to the traditional dichotomy, both subdivisions make key contributions to emotional processing. Specifically, dorsal-caudal regions of the ACC and mPFC are involved in appraisal and expression of negative emotion, whereas ventral-rostral portions of the ACC and mPFC have a regulatory role with respect to limbic regions involved in generating emotional responses. Moreover, this new framework is broadly consistent with emerging data on other negative and positive emotions.},

Participants were subjected to either the standard future-life exclusion manipulation (purported to be a highly severe social injury) or a newly created, less-severe version.

abstract = {Major life events involving social rejection are strongly associated with onset of depression. To account for this relation, we propose a psychobiological model in which rejection-related stressors elicit a distinct and integrated set of cognitive, emotional, and biological changes that may evoke depression. In this model, social rejection events activate brain regions involved in processing negative affect and rejection-related distress (e.g., anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). They also elicit negative self-referential cognitions (e.g., "I'm undesirable," "Other people don't like me") and related self-conscious emotions (e.g., shame, humiliation). Downstream biological consequences include upregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis, and inflammatory response. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in this process because they induce a constellation of depressotypic behaviors called sickness behaviors. Although these changes can be short-lived, sustained inflammation may occur via glucocorticoid resistance, catecholamines, sympathetic innervation of immune organs, and immune cell aging. This response also may be moderated by several factors, including prior life stress, prior depression, and genes implicated in stress reactivity.},

abstract = {Contemporary theories emphasize the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in assigning hedonic values to rewards. Although prior research supports this view, recent findings suggest that opioids play a larger and more complex role in reward processes than these theories suggest. For example, opioid activity in the basolateral amygdala is required for encoding incentive learning, a process by which the value of goal-directed actions is updated. Outside of the amygdala, opioid receptors in the ventral striatum have been found to promote choice between different courses of action. Specifically, $\mu$-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and $\delta$-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell have been reported to mediate distinct aspects of incentive motivation; the core regulating the effect of experienced reward and the shell of predicted reward on choice. In both cases, the involvement of opioid receptors was restricted to the time of choice, although changes in their expression pattern could be observed prior to that point. This time restricted involvement of opioid receptor-related processes is consistent with the view that opioids in the nucleus accumbens are central components of the limbic-motor interface, integrating reward-related information with instrumental learning to guide decision-making, particularly the selection and execution of goal-directed actions.},
annote = {Critical role of endogenous opioids (EO) in reward processing

In rodents: EO agonists involved in reinforcing behaviour, whereas antagonists induced aversive states (450)

In humans: basic receptor agonist/antagonists and feelings of arousal

E: These two literatures taken together lead to the emerging view that the opioid system acts as the "hedonic mediator" of the CNS, computing and attributing emotional values to environmental stimuli (450).

Opioids maintain and adjust the "hedonic" tone of the brain 

This idea remains central to many contemporary theories about neurotransmitters.

Recent literature suggests that involvement of EO cannot be limited to this "hedonic: role alone (consistent with the widespread distribution of opioid receptors in the brain

In particular, the role of opioids in decision-making and in choice between goal-directed actions 
(based on conditioned response - predictive learning) (450)

Choice between two or more possible actions can be influenced by two separate factors:
1. the reward value assigned to the consequences oor outcome of an action. 
---{\textgreater} EO are necessary to learn about such reward values
And these appear to be distinct from involvement in hedonic processes
---{\textgreater} EO activity is also required later when these values control choice between actions, that is, in value-based decision-making (Laurent et al. 2012). 

2. Presence of reward-related stimuli: EO receptors form a critical role in the form of choice that is reliant on predictive learning (450).



Propposition: "The performance of instrumental actions depends on the value assigned to the rewards they procure. It follows that these values depend, at least in part, on the emotional effects of those rewards" (450)

---{\textgreater} traditionally measured, especially in rodents, in simple terms such as the amount or rate of reward consumption

---{\textgreater} there is now an extensive literature proposing that the ‘hedonic' value of a reward can instead be assessed directly through the analysis of more complex behaviours including orofacial reactions in response to tastes and the microstructure of the licking responses as a result of liquid intake" (450)


Eg. Rodents and orofacial reactions to sugar:
mu-opioid agonists in nucleus accumben shell (NAc-S) and ventral pallidum (VP) increases orofacial reactions elicited by sucrose, and disconnection of these opioid-stimulated areas of the brain reduces palatability (measured by these same orofacial reactions (Pecina et al. 2006; Smith {\&} berridge 2007; Berridge et al. 2009) (451)

And: "mice with genetic deletion of $\mu$ receptors were found to display impairments in licking behaviour, suggesting an inability to properly process the palatability of liquid rewards (Ostlund et al., 2013) (451)

NAc-S and VP may represent "hedonic hotspots" where opioids modulate what they refer to as ‘liking responses' (Berridge, 2009; Berridge et al., 2009) 

changes in licking ≠ changes in liking 

However! it does not necessarily follow that changes in licking represent changes in liking, or, for that matter, changes in reward value.

Changes in reward require an additional form of learning known as incentive learning and, although recent evidence suggests this learning is mediated by an opioid process, it appears to be independent of opioid-related changes in licking involving the NAc-S and the VP (Figure 1).

Incentive Learning (451):
Opioid activity in the BLA is required for incentive learning, an essential process by which the values of reward are updated (456)

Balleine {\&} Dickson 1991:
Association of a hedonic reward with ilness (through injection follwoing reward consumption (sucrose

Method known as Conditioned Taste Aversion (CTA) 

This procedure clearlydiminishes the hedonic value of the paired reward, surprisingly, it often has no immediate effect on instrumental performance (i.e. the action that produced the original reward, like tapping a lever).

instrumental lever pressing was not reduced in the CTA cohort until an extra modification to the study was intriduced, in which the CTA rodents had the opportunity to freely consume sucrose the next day. Only then did they display significant reduction in lever tapping (compared to a control who se LiCl inlness was administered via a delay so that it was not associated with the sucrose reward).

These results suggest that "the action values are preserved after devaluation until they are modified through consum- matory experience" (451)

This is incentive learning

Important: incentive learning requires opioid activity in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) (452)

Found that "licking micro-structure induced by sucrose is sensitive to opioid manipulations, as the change in licking microstructure associated with an increase in food deprivation was blocked by naloxone (opioid blocker) (452).

assigning incentive value to rewarding outcomes involves an evaluative learning process that does not rely on those mediating changes in orofacial reactions in the NAc-S or VP. Although the effects of changes in reward palatability on conditioned consummatory responses require $\mu$ receptor activity in the NAc-S and the VP, the desirability of rewards (i.e. their incentive value) involves activation of $\mu$ receptors in the BLA.

---{\textgreater} "incentive learning is impaired by lesion (Balleine et al., 2003), pharmacological inactivation (Shiflett and Balleine, 2010) or other pharmacological manipulations (Wang et al., 2005; Parkes and Balleine, 2013) of the BLA" (452)

Choice between actions:
opioid activity in the nucleus accumbens is essential for guiding choice between actions (456)

Consistent with the view that this region acts as the limbic–motor interface (Mogenson et al., 1980; Alexander et al., 1986), we have described evidence showing that opioid activity in the accumbens is only essential at the time of choice.

In particular, studies into pathological conditions have focused on the roles of high amplitude, phasically evoked dopamine release in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. However, research has shown that dopamine release can be more complex than just phasic release; thus, there is also a tonic, background dopamine release, with alterations in tonic dopamine release likely having unique and important functional roles. Unfortunately, however, tonic dopamine release has received relatively little attention. In this review, we summarize our recent studies and discuss how modulation of the dopamine system, both in terms of phasic activation and attenuation of tonic dopamine are important for the functions of brain regions receiving this dopamine innervation, and that imbalances in these dopamine release mechanisms may play a significant role in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.},

Employing functional molecular imaging, activation of NAC dopamine (DA) release was observed during placebo administration and related to its anticipated effects, perception-anticipation mismatches, and placebo effect development. In additional functional MRI studies, the expectation of monetary gain increased NAC synaptic activity in a manner proportional to placebo-induced DA release, anticipated effects, perception-anticipation differentials, and actual placebo effects.

@article{Barbano2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: More than two decades ago, Wise proposed his "anhedonia hypothesis" to explain the role of dopamine in motivated behaviors. The hypothesis posits that dopamine mediates the pleasure experienced by reward obtainment. However, some experimental findings have contested this hypothesis and several authors have proposed alternative functions for dopamine with regard to motivation. Brain dopamine has been suggested to rather code for the preparatory aspects of behavior, while brain opioids seem to mediate the perception of the hedonic properties of rewards.

OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this review is to reexamine dopamine and opioids involvement in feeding when different aspects such as the anticipatory, motivational and consummatory components of this behavior are taken into account, but also when the physiologic state of the organism and the palatability of the food are considered.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the data presented point out for an implication of dopamine in the anticipatory/preparatory aspects of feeding more than on the motivational and consummatory aspects. However, dopamine involvement in the anticipatory/preparatory component of feeding seems specifically related to very relevant stimuli, such as highly palatable foods. On the other hand, our data, as well as those present in the literature, strongly suggest a role for opioids in food intake through their modulation of the hedonic perception of food. As a consequence, opioids are involved in those aspects of motivation driven by food palatability rather than by food homeostatic need.},

Using molecular imaging techniques, we directly examined the activity of the endogenous opioid system on mu-opioid receptors in humans in sustained pain with and without the administration of a placebo. Significant placebo-induced activation of mu-opioid receptor-mediated neurotransmission was observed in both higher-order and sub-cortical brain regions, which included the pregenual and subgenual rostral anterior cingulate, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the insular cortex, and the nucleus accumbens. Regional activations were paralleled by lower ratings of pain intensity, reductions in its sensory and affective qualities, and in the negative emotional state of the volunteers. These data demonstrate that cognitive factors (e.g., expectation of pain relief) are capable of modulating physical and emotional states through the site-specific activation of mu-opioid receptor signaling in the human brain.},

Aristotle's moral virtues parallel with the "negative" directives of Daoist practice, namely the achievement of mean between excess and defect.




Aristotle's intellectual virtues parallel with the "positive" aspects of Daoist practice, namely self-actualisation through excellence (de - 得）？
























































"A practical form of embodied mysticism lies at the center of the Daoist understanding of a person and his or her place in the world" (1):








a psychological attitudeof detachment from the ego, attention to care for the health and vitality of the body, and preservation of vital energy produces the state of character in which the primordial Dao will enlighten and envivify a sage. Everyday practices involving self-discipline and self- cultivation lead to transcendence, which ultimately consists of a profound form of harmony with the primordial source of all of nature, the Dao. (12)








Self-development is obviously very high on Aristotle's list of ethical priorities. Since virtue is a state of character,35 and character is largely a matter of habit,36 virtue and




























one would expect regular exercise to improve the health of most humans, whatever their cultural contexts, one would expect that these religious embodied practices of self-cultivation will exhibit at least some similar effects cross-culturally. In this sense, postulated cross-cultural similarities in practice might even be construed as scientific hypotheses for sociological or anthropological research. (4








形／身：
"Within the cosmological system, the body takes on a particularly remarkable position. Divided into the xing, the cosmic body that is part of creation, and the shēn, the personal body that is part of the man-made world and thus
opposed to the Tao, the body is on the borderline between true realization and complete loss of naturalness; a bulwark of primordiality and a fortress of egoism at the very same time." (6)















Embodiying the way: 














disciplining the shen aspects of body to prevent the blocking of qi while enhancing the health and primordial qualities of xing, to make it a smooth vehicle for presenting Dao, which is ultimately, its own nature as well as the nature of the universe, is the goal of religious practice in the Xisheng jing (6)















Kirkland (2004): Five proceedures for achieving itegration of the whole person with Dao:








1. “prudence,” i.e. self control and moderation in consumption and sensual pleasures;
2. “prohibitions' regarding improper activities in those regards; 
3. self-massage 
4. guiding the ch'i by visualizational meditation 
5. “guarding the One” to achieve apotropatic powers
























Two Goals of Self-discipline:








1. attuning one's body (xing) to a healthy state of equilibrium, while curtailing equilibrium disturbing psychological or mental propensities (shēn).Qi energy or vitality is optimized, and attunement of the body to smooth interaction with the environment (both physiologically and psychologically) is practiced. (8)






































Discipline is directed at suppressing any propensity, whether physical, mental or otherwise that would cause friction either intrapersonally or interpersonally (8).














EMOTIONAL NEG-ENTROPY








2. aims at achieving a very high level of functioning and self-expression, and opening the door for what contemporary psychologists call peak experiences. Optimal physiological, psychological and mental functioning will enable a person to achieve states of transcendent harmony with his or her environment, and ecstatic expression of the qualities or talents most central to one's nature and personality.























transcendence as attunement to the unseen forces of nature (9)





































Ethics embodied: 






















return to the Dao may be either an enstatic absorption in the darkness of the Tao, or an ecstatic state of liberation into a sense of spiritual freedom.25 In either case, it is the self-development of the virtues already cited that leads to the natural and embodied, yet mystically transcendent state of the accomplished Sage (10)
















It is from the perspective of being embodied within a body and a community that we judge some things as ‘good' and others as ‘bad;' but we universalize the judgments falsely, forgetting their sources.






























Aristotle and Eudaimonia: 






























"Aristotle's eudaimonia state involves the enjoyment of maximal self expression in harmony with one's well developed talents." (15)








Practicing these activities to the point at which they become a form of contemplation is the best of which a human is capable (15)







































Virtue, for Aristotle, is proper function, in the mundane sense that a virtuous knifecuts well, and a virtuous lyre-player plays the lyre well.34 So, his goal is to seek the proper function of a human being, again, in the mundane sense of seeking the certain type of life, lived in activities that reflect the excellence of human nature habits for a properly functioning character to the highest degree possible, and living a lifestyle that exhibits activities in accordance with these habits. His faculty-psychology distinguishes between intellectual and moral virtues, in a way that can be seen as reflecting similar sensibilities to those of Daoist authors (12-13).








Aristotle's intellectual virtues are actually not rational principles, but rather,practices that parallel what I called the positive ethical practices of Daoism. They are the fulfillments of talents, which might be regarded as the self-expression of one's de, in Chinese terms. (13)















The soul, or psyche, for Aristotle，is the form of the body, it is “the actuality of some form of body”42















Aristotle's developed conception of eudaimonia as a state of virtuous character featuring high levels of skills and accomplished states of contemplation features a form of transcendence that like Daoism's conception of transcendence, may be ecstatic or enstatic. And similar paths are used to achieve these goals in both cases; suppression of egotistical desires coupled with rigorous self-discipline directed at skill development.},

        Plato{\&}{\#}039;s Republic {\&} Eudaimonia: one of the central arguments in favour of being just
        

        

        

        
Glaucon and Adeimantus challenge Socrates to show that acting justly always makes one better off than acting unjustly (1)

        

        
Eudaimonia as "success":
This word is most commonly translated as {\&}{\#}039;happiness{\&}{\#}039;, though some have proposed {\&}{\#}039;flourishing{\&}{\#}039;. {\&}{\#}039;Success{\&}{\#}039; is a more natural rendering than the latter and less misleading than the former (1)

        

        
          

          
P: Socrates as the champion of eudaimonia as outcome of "virtous activity"

          

        
        

        
Does living justly make life more "profitable", or makes life "better"  G{\&}A question, but they only refer to eudaimonia once, obliquely... (1)

        

        
"Socrates seems to presuppose that questions about justice{\&}{\#}039;s value pertain to human beings who are pursuing success (358a1-3, taking makarios here to be a terminological variant of eudaimōn [cf. 354a1-2])" (2)

        

        
Thus, Plato combines living justly (morally) with human excellence {\&} success:

        

        
"...the best and most just is the most eudaimon, that this is the kingliest who is king over himself, that the worst and most unjust is the most wretched, and that this happens to be the one who is most tyrannical since he most tyrannizes both himself and his city?"" (3)

        

        
-- tyrannizes himself and his city: this is a personal and ethico-moral tyranny

        

        
Eudaimonia is a perfectly ordinary Greek word thatrefers nebulously, just as our word {\&}{\#}039;success{\&}{\#}039; does, to a mixture of good luck, noteworthy achievements, material comfort, and emotional well-being. So it is easily exchanged for "a good life," and what brings eudaimonia is easily called "advantageous" or "profitable." (3)

        

        

        

        The Socratic Conception (of Eudaimonia):
        

        

        

        
The argument, formed logically: 

        

        
1. The function of an X is what X alone or best does
2. The virtue/excellence of an X is what makes an X perform its function well (and be a good X), and the vice of an X is what makes an X perform its function badly (and be a bad X).
3. Living is the function of a (human) soul. 
4. Justice is the virtue/excellence of a human soul, and injustice its vice
5. So: A just soul lives well, and an unjust soul badly. 
6. Anyone who lives well is eudaimōn, and anyone who lives badly is wretched (athlios).
7. So: A just soul is eudaimōn, and an unjust one wretched. 8.It profits one not to be unhappy but to be happy. 
9. So: Injustice is never more profitable than justice.
(5)

        

        
"Living well" is crucial here:
          

          
Socrates identifies eudaimonia with justly living well (6).
Socrates frequently insists that being virtuous entails acting well which in turn entails being eudaimōn (6).

        

        
"And in this way, governed by 
        

        
          

        
        
          moderation
        
        
          

        
        

        , a household would be managed nobly [kalōs], and so would a city be governed, and so would everything else over which moderation rules. For with error removed and rightness in control, those disposed in this way necessarily 
        

        
          

        
        
          act nobly and well [kalōs kai eu] in every action,
        
        
          

        
        

         and those who act well are necessarily eudaimōn.
        

        

        

        

        

        P: Eudaimonia is virtous activity, not merely a list of good posessions (health and friendship etc) (8)
        

        

        

        
"If nothing is a good without being unconditionally beneficial (that is, beneficial in every circumstance), then, plausibly, health is not a good" (8).

        

        
          

          
virtous activity is a good and comes first before posessing goods:
        

        
"First, if eudaimonia is virtuous activity, then since virtuous activity requires at least some measure of health, one has good reason to value and pursue health just because one has good reason to value and pursue eudaimonia. Also, if eudaimonia is virtuous activity, it requires virtue, and if virtue requires evaluating positively things that have positive value, then eudaimonia can require positively evaluating health even if health is not to be seen as unconditionally beneficial and thereby good" (9)

        

        
Secondly, To say what eudaimonia is, one should not list all the necessary conditions for being eudaimōn. Such a list would include food, drink, and air, and a whole host of bacteria and enzymes.

        

        
Instead, one should say what makes a eudaimōn life eudaimōn and what serves as the practical goal for the sake of which a eudaimōn person should do everything he or she does (9)

        

        
nothing is good unless it benefits and nothing benefits unless it is used in a certain way. What makes a person eudaimōn, on this view, is activity of a certain sort and not the assets that the activity engages (9).
        

        

        

        
anyone who lives well is eudaimōn, and then it follows for Socrates in reply to G{\&}A:

        

        
(1) Justice is a virtue. 
(2) So: virtuous activity requires acting justly. 
(3) Eudaimonia is virtuous activity. 
(4) So: eudaimonia requires acting justly.
(10)

        

        
"Socrates{\&}{\#}039; strategy in the Republic is not to show that justice is a virtue on the assumption that eudaimonia is virtuous activity. It is to show that acting justly is or brings about more eudaimonia than acting otherwise, on the assumption that justice is a virtue that makes one good" (11).

        

        
          

          
The Adolescent Conception (of Eudaimonia):
        

        

        

        
Adeimantus raises the contention that private possessions are fundamentally important to eudaimonia:

        

        
Socrates has just finished explaining how the guardians will be situated in an ideal city. He says that they will live without private property—not even touching gold or silver—and with minimal sustenance, as soldiers in a camp with a common mess hall (416d-417b). 

        

        
          

          
This is almost like the coneption of the Buddha! 
        

        

        

        

        

        
Adeimantus worries about this (419a1-420a2): "What
defense will you offer, Socrates, if someone were to say that you don{\&}{\#}039;t make these men [sic] eudaimōn at all and that it{\&}{\#}039;s their own fault, since the city in truth belongs to them, yet they derive no good from it. Others own land, build fine big houses, acquire furnishing fitting for them, make their own private sacrifices to the gods, entertain guests, and also, of course, possess what you were talking about just now, gold and silver and all the things that are thought to belong to people who are blessed [makariois]. But one might well say that they are settled in the city like hired guards, doing nothing but watching over it." (13)

        

        
Adeimantus worries that the guardians of Socrates{\&}{\#}039; ideal city fail to be eudaimōn. But the charge is not that the guardians fail to act virtuously. Some other conception of eudaimonia is assumed.... (13)

        

        
(In book four, Socrates) politely and elaborately insists that his task is to design a city that is eudaimōn as a whole and not to design a city so that one or two particular classes in it are eudaimōn (420b-421c).

        

        
          

          
Is this an indication that there are "roles" for individuals in the creation of a republic? Some have access to eudaimonia, whereas others don{\&}{\#}039;t? 

          

        
        

        
Indeed, Socrates goes on to argue in Book 5: 
          

          

          

          
"If a
          

        
        
           guardian tries to become eudaimōn in such a way that he{\&}{\#}039;s no longer a guardian
        
        
          

         and isn{\&}{\#}039;t satisfied by a life that{\&}{\#}039;s measured, stable, and—as we say—best, but a foolish and adolescent view [anoētos te kai meirakiōdēs doxa] of eudaimonia seizes him and incites him to use his power to appropriate everything in the city for himself, he{\&}{\#}039;ll come to know that Hesiod was really wise when he said that {\&}{\#}039;the half is somehow more than the whole.{\&}{\#}039;"

        

        
          

          

          

        
        

        

        

        Here in book five Socrates rejects the adolescent conception of eudaimonia, asserting the foolishness of the guardian (whose role/function is to live moderately and be free from posessions so as to effectively guard the city) who would seek to possess goods as an "objective list theory" of eudaimonia would encourage.  This conception of eudaimonia is "adolescent", it involves attachment or grasping of objects and lack of understanding of the part that the individual plays in the realisation of the whole (the realisation of a just and virtuous "republic"

          

        
        

        
          

          
The Democritean Conception (of Eudaimonia): 

          

          

          

        Socrates{\&}{\#}039; crucial observation is that a soul, to the extent that it is filled with ever- growing appetitive desires, is more likely to experience conflicting and unsatisfiable desires and so less likely to do what it wants. That is why the most disordered soul filled with limitless appetites—the tyrannical soul—is least likely to do what it wants (17)

        

        
He then assumes that past manifestations of this inability occasion regret; present manifestations occasion feelings of poverty and frustration; and future manifestations occasion fear. These negative feelings then are summed up as wretchedness.

        

        
          

          
Doesn{\&}{\#}039;t this look a lot like the circular production of anxiety disorders, or the "reification of the dysfunctional narrative self" ? (Vago {\&} Silbersweig 2012: 3)

          

        
        

        
          

          
The just person experiences more pleasure than the unjust:
        

        
          

          

          

        
        

        
Socrates could generalize and conclude that vice correlates with psychological disorder which correlates with negative feelings, whereas virtue correlates with psychological order and the absence of negative feelings.
          

          

          

          
---This is psychological entropy! 

          

        
        

        
Eudaimonia might just be the presence of good feelings (such as pleasure) and the absence of bad feelings (such as pain). This subjectivist account might seem anachronistic, but it closely resembles the view that late antiquity attributes to Democritus, the atomist who was born some thirty years before Plato (17)
          

          

          

        
        

        
Democritus says that "the goal [telos, i.e., that for the sake of which one should do everything one does, i.e., eudaimonia] is good-spiritedness [euthumia], which is not the same pleasure, as some have misunderstood it to be, but that in which the soul continues in peace and in good balance, disturbed by no fear or superstition or any other passion (18).

        

        
Socrates explicitly rejects pleasure and good feelings as a guide to life and thereby rejects the view that eudaimonia is the presence of good feelings and absence of bad feelings (18-19).

        

        
Socrates: What about those who define the good as pleasure [cf. 505b5-6]? Does confusion fill them any less than it does the others [who define the good as knowledge, cf. 505b6-c5]? Or aren{\&}{\#}039;t they also forced to agree that there are bad pleasures?"

        

        
Socrates tries, among other things, to get Callicles to see that some pleasures are intrinsically shameful. More generally, on Socrates{\&}{\#}039; view, that something feels good for one does not mean that something is good for one (19-20).

        

        
And when we pursue the human good (eudaimonia), we pursue what is good for us and not merely what seems to be good for us (505d)

        

        

        

        So good feeling by itself is not enough. A good feeling must at least survive reflection as something good for us, and that requires some awareness of some good for us independent of good feelings (20)

        

        
P: subjective satisfaction—good feelings—come cheaply. Many different kinds of agents can get them, and all three parts of the human soul have their own pleasures (581c) (20).

        

        
Socrates maintains that if spirited and appetitive desires are indulged and are not held in check by countervailing commitments to what is genuinely good, they will grow stronger and more numerous (20)

        

        
"even the just person must continually prevent the many- headed beast of appetite from sprouting savage heads (589a-b; cf. 571b-572b)"

        

        
So Socrates{\&}{\#}039; moral psychology targets not only subjective satisfaction but also objective accounts of eudaimonia broader than the Socratic account, according to which eudaimonia is virtuous activity (21-22).

They also discuss the newly created classification of character strengths and virtues, a positive complement to the various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (e. g., American Psychiatric Association, 1994), and present some cross-cultural findings that suggest a surprising ubiquity of strengths and virtues. Finally, the authors focus on psychological interventions that increase individual happiness. In a 6-group, random-assignment, placebo-controlled Internet study, the authors tested 5 purported happiness interventions and 1 plausible control exercise. They found that 3 of the interventions lastingly increased happiness and decreased depressive symptoms. Positive interventions can supplement traditional interventions that relieve suffering and may someday be the practical legacy of positive psychology.},

@article{Mongrain2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The current work replicated a landmark study conducted by Seligman and colleagues (2005) that demonstrated the long-term benefits of positive psychology exercises (PPEs). In the original study, two exercises administered over 1 week ("Three Good Things" and "Using your Signature Strengths in a New Way") were found to have long-lasting effects on depression and happiness (Seligman, Steen, Park, {\&} Peterson, 2005).

DESIGN: These exercises were tested here using the same methodology except for improvements to the control condition, and the addition of a second "positive placebo" to isolate the common factor of accessing positive, self-relevant constructs. This component control design was meant to assess the effect of expectancies for success (expectancy control), as well the cognitive access of positive information about the self (positive placebo).

RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses showed that the PPEs led to lasting increases in happiness, as did the positive placebo. The PPEs did not exceed the control condition in producing changes in depression over time.

CONCLUSIONS: Brief, positive psychology interventions may boost happiness through a common factor involving the activation of positive, self-relevant information rather than through other specific mechanisms. Finally, the effects of PPEs on depression may be more modest than previously assumed.},

abstract = {A large proportion of the health woes beleaguering modern cultures are because of daily physical activity patterns that are profoundly different from those for which we are genetically adapted. The ancestral natural environment in which our current genome was forged via natural selection called for a large amount of daily energy expenditure on a variety of physical movements. Our genes that were selected for in this arduous and demanding natural milieu enabled our ancestors to survive and thrive, leading to a very vigorous lifestyle. This abrupt (by evolutionary time frames) change from a very physically demanding lifestyle in natural outdoor settings to an inactive indoor lifestyle is at the origin of many of the widespread chronic diseases that are endemic in our modern society. The logical answer is to replicate the native human activity pattern to the extent that this is achievable and practical. Recommendations for exercise mode, duration, intensity, and frequency are outlined with a focus on simulating the routine physical activities of our ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors whose genome we still largely share today. In a typical inactive person, this type of daily physical activity will optimize gene expression and help to confer the robust health that was enjoyed by hunter-gatherers in the wild.},

abstract = {This study examines the electrophysiological correlates of dyadic interaction in 14-month-old infants. Infants were presented with three conditions of live stimuli. A baseline condition involved the observation of moving geometric shapes. In a second condition the infant observed an adult performing movements that were not in reference to the infant and were not within the infant's proficient motor repertoire, such as dancing or hopping. A third condition involved face to face dyadic interactions in the context of an imitative game, where the infant and adult engaged in copying each other's hand and facial actions. Motor activity by the infant was controlled between conditions by synchronizing EEG with video frames of action. Infant EEG data was then edited offline to match in motor intensity across conditions. We expected mu rhythm (6-9 Hz) suppression during dyadic interactions relative to the amount of mu present in the baseline condition. This prediction was confirmed. We also observed suppressed mu in the interaction condition relative to the observation condition. The mu rhythm results suggest that infants at 14 months may well utilize a functioning mirroring system during dyadic interactions.},

abstract = {Experiences of social rejection, exclusion or loss are generally considered to be some of the most 'painful' experiences that we endure. Indeed, many of us go to great lengths to avoid situations that may engender these experiences (such as public speaking). Why is it that these negative social experiences have such a profound effect on our emotional well-being? Emerging evidence suggests that experiences of social pain--the painful feelings associated with social disconnection--rely on some of the same neurobiological substrates that underlie experiences of physical pain. Understanding the ways in which physical and social pain overlap may provide new insights into the surprising relationship between these two types of experiences.},
annote = {"Physical pain is a deeply psychological phenomenon that can be altered by expectations, mood and attention. Likewise, social pain is a deeply biologi- cal phenomenon that has been built into our brains and bodies over millions of years of mammalian evolution because of the crucial part it plays in our survival" (432). 


"social attachment system may have piggybacked onto the opioid substrates of the physical pain system to maintain proximity with others, eliciting distress upon separation (through low opioid receptor activity) and comfort upon reunion (through high opioid receptor activity)" (422)




Interesting point: Opioid receptor agonists reduce time spent in close proximity with con-specifics26,27,31
, presumably because
the opioids act as a substitute for the rewarding expe- rience of social connection. Conversely, opioid recep- tor antagonists increase attempts at social connection through grooming32
, presumably in order to increase
the experience of reward (through social means) that is being reduced by opioid receptor antagonists




Affective and sensory components of physical and social pain:



Cortical substrates (423):




Affective:


- dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC - Brodmann areas 24 and 32, superior and posterior to the genu of the corpus callosum): important in the distressing experience of physical pain, the aspect of pain that makes it "bothering"

- anterior insula (AI): "Insular lesions produce similar out-comes, leading to pain asymbolia, a condition in which pain is perceived but does not cause distress or suffer- ing40
, or other disruptions of pain affect (423).

Sensory:

posterior insula (PI), 
somatosensory cortex (S1) and 
secondary somasensory cortex (S2)




"given the profound capacity of opiates to reduce the affective component of pain, it is not surprising thatboth the dACC and AI have some of the highest densities of mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system" (424)



P: particular importance of the affective regions of cortical pain substrates in the processing of social pain.
F1: Animal studies - social separation-related behaviours (isolation calls and maternal behaviour) seem to rely on dACC or ACC more generally 

F2: Human studies - dACC lesions show decrements in self-consciousness, as well as the reduced concern about the opinions or social judgements of others (424). 
- Neural responses to social exclusion "Cyberball" (Eisenberger et al. 2003, Eisenberger {\&} Leiberman 2004): inclusion followed by exclusion - increased activation of dACC and AI, and this activation was associated with greater feelings of social distress (424). 



"Several additional studies have used the Cyberball task to examine the neural correlates of social exclu- sion from strangers. Many of these studies have shown increased activity in the dACC and/or AI in response to social exclusion7,66–75 (BOX 1) and/or a positive cor- relation between neural activity in these regions and self-reported feelings of social distress in response to exclusion7,67,69,70,73,76–78" (424)


factors typically associated with a greater sensitivity to social exclusion, such as l

ow self-esteem

, 

anxious attachment

, 

interpersonal sensitivity

or a tendency to feel 

socially disconnected on a daily basis

, have been shown to be associated with increased neural activity in the dACC and/or AI in response to social exclusion (424). 





"Likewise, factors typically associated with a reduced sensitiv- ity to social exclusion, such as social support
or avoidant attachment, have been shown to be associated
with reduced activity in the dACC and/or AI.




Particularly: Masten et al. (2012) and Eisenberger et al. (2007)


dACC responses to threatening stimuli do not become evident until later in development (425) - dACC might be a post-adolescent response, indicating a more mature, moral grasp of social pain???



some studies of romantic rejection also activates sensory-related neural activity (427) This may be to the more intense (somatic?) experience of social pain that results from rejection from a close other...


But these findings (somatosensory activation) are at odds with other studies that fail to find these activations in instances of social loss or bereavement... 



rejection versus bereavement and the activation of sensory regions:

"possible that sensory neural regions are associated with devaluation of the self by others (being rejected) rather than experiences of social pain that involve the termination of a relationship but do not imply that the self is devalued (bereavement)" (427)


dACC: not either cognition or affect! pain as an affective alarm signaling error

the important role of dACC in cognitive processing of error detection: conflicting response tendencies... "the dACC may perform both cognitive and affective functions that complement one another in supporting efficient goal-corrected behaviour" (428)


Dispositional sensitivity to both social and physical pain (428):


social rejection seen to increase pain ratings in a cold-pressor task (428) 
some work has shown that analgesicresponses can also result from the presence of social threats. For example, being told that one will be alone in the future has been shown to reduce physical pain sensitivity. Although it is not clear why social rejec-
tion and/or exclusion sometimes leads to increased physical pain and sometimes to reduced physical pain, these differences are not incompatible with the physical pain literature, which has shown both hyperalgesia and analgesia following nociceptive stimulation

Bernstein {\&} Claypool et al. 2012: exclusion sometimes hurts and sometimes numbs....! cost-benefit tradeoff!! 

(Humphrey/Trimmer etc)





Affective pain processing and health: 

Given that the dACC and AI are involved inresponding to social disconnection, these regions may have a role in translating experiences of social discon- nection into downstream physiological responses — such as heightened inflammatory activity, the immune system's first line of defence against foreign agents and infection — which have health implications.


"Triangulating across these various lines of evidence
suggests that the dACC and AI may be important mediators of the links between experiences of social disconnection and both physical and mental health" (431)




dACC as neural alarm system for survival relevant threats: 


"it is possible that these regions have a broader role as a neural alarm system (BOX 3), which triggers affec- tive, behavioural and autonomic responses8to various types of survival relevant threats — with indicators of social or physical harm being some salient examples (431)


"Physical pain is a deeply psychological phenomenon that can be altered by expectations, mood and attention. Likewise, social pain is a deeply biologi- cal phenomenon that has been built into our brains and bodies over millions of years of mammalian evolution because of the crucial part it plays in our survival" (432).},

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence over the past decade has highlighted an important role of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in the regulation of stress and emotional behavior across divergent species, from rodents to humans. The general findings from this work indicate that the eCB system plays an important role in gating and buffering the stress response, dampening anxiety and regulating mood. Work in rodents has allowed researchers to determine the neural mechanisms mediating this relationship while work in human populations has demonstrated the possible importance of this system in stress-related psychiatric diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety and major depression. These stress-protective effects of eCB signaling appear to be primarily mediated by their actions within corticolimbic structures, particularly the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date discussion of the current level of knowledge in this field, as well as address the current gaps in knowledge and specific areas of research that require attention.},

@article{Eisenberger2011,
abstract = {Although it has long been hypothesized that attachment figures provide individuals with a sense of safety and security, the neural mechanisms underlying attachment-induced safety have not been explored. Here, we investigated whether an attachment figure acts as a safety signal by exploring whether viewing an attachment figure during a threatening experience (physical pain) led to increased activity in a neural region associated with safety signaling, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and corresponding reductions in pain. Female participants in long-term romantic relationships were scanned as they received painful stimuli while viewing pictures of their partner and control images (stranger, object). Consistent with the idea that the attachment figure may signal safety, results revealed that viewing partner pictures while receiving painful stimulation led to reductions in self-reported pain ratings, reductions in pain-related neural activity (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula), and increased activity in the VMPFC. Moreover, greater VMPFC activity in response to partner pictures was associated with longer relationship lengths and greater perceived partner support, further highlighting a role for the VMPFC in responding to the safety value of the partner. Last, greater VMPFC activity while viewing partner pictures was associated with reduced pain ratings and reduced pain-related neural activity. An implication of these findings is that, in the same way that stimuli that historically have threatened survival (e.g., snakes, spiders) are considered to be prepared fear stimuli, attachment figures, who have historically benefited survival, may serve as prepared safety stimuli, reducing threat- or distress-related responding in their presence.},
annote = {The presence versus absence of an attachment figure is known to produce quite distinct behavioral profiles in the same child—with courage and exploration seen in the caregiver's presence and timidity and fear observed in the caregiver's absence (11721)

accumulating correlational and experimental evi- dence has demonstrated the pain-attenuating effects of an at- tachment figure or other supportive individual

few studies have examined the mechanisms that produce these pain-attenuating effects (cf. ref. 8), and no studies have examined whether these effects are caused by the safety- inducing properties of the supportive individuals themselves

VMPFC: Safety signaling in rodents and humans:
VMPFC activity appears to track stimuli that signal safety, and this activity is thought to modulate other neural regions that are involved in responding to the threat at hand (11722)

VMPFC is more active in response to cues (tones, shapes) that, through learning, signal safety (e.g., no shock) compared with cues that signal negative outcomes (e.g., shock) (11721)

The VMPFC is also more active during fear extinction, a form of learned safety in which a cue that previously predicted a negative outcome now predicts safety

In addition, theVMPFCis thought to have inhibitory control over certain limbic regions, such as the amygdala, leading to reductions in conditioned fear responses in the presence of safety cues or during fear extinction

in humans, increased activity in the VMPFC (including the subgenual ante- rior cingulate cortex; subACC) has been observed in response to safety signals (relative to fear-predictive stimuli)

In studies of psychological stress, the VMPFC is typically more active during the control condition (which presumably is safer) than in the stress condition (11722).

consistent with an inhibitory role for the VMPFC in threat-related responding, greater VMPFC activity during stress has been shown to be associated with reductions in heart rate and self-reported anxiety (20–22) and reduced activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (22), a region positively associated with cardio-vascular responses to stress (11722)

Pain expectation manipulation and VMPFC: 
expectations about the intensity of an upcoming painful stimulus were varied so that participants expected a low-pain stimulus on some trials and a high-pain stimulus on others; regardless of the expectation, participants received a medium-level pain stimulus. Results demonstrated that expecting a low-pain compared to a high-pain stimulus led to greater activity in the VMPFC (24), potentially reflecting the greater relative safety value of the low- vs. high-pain cue (Atlas et al. 2010).

the VMPFC has been shown to be more active in re-
sponse to conditions that signify relative safety and to correlate negatively with fear, stress, and pain responses.

The present study:

Method:
- fMRI female participants (n=21, age = 23.4, SD = 3.8) in long term romantic relationships (raverage relationship length reported was 3.52 y (range: 9 mo to 13 y)) three of the participants were married to their partners.
Inclusion criteria, omong others: rated their partner as a significant source of social support, with a score of at least 7 on a scale from 1 (not a source of support) to 10 (a tremendous source of social support).
--{\textgreater} Four participants who were no longer with their partners by the end of the study were not included in the present analyses! (11725)

- two sessions:
Session 1: 
Participant arrived with her partner, pain threshold was determined using a double random staircase algorithim:

"if the previous response is above the chosen threshold, the next stimulus for that staircase is lowered, and if the rating is below the threshold, the next stimulus is increased. Stimuli from two staircases (with starting temperatures of 37 °C and 40 °C) were presented pseudorandomly to mask the rating–stimulus intensity relationship within a staircase. Stimulus temperatures on subsequent trials within a staircase were increased or decreased by increments between 1.6 °C and 0.2 °C, with smaller changes when the staircase crossed the threshold or reversed direction" 

“there are two different aspects of discomfort that people usually feel in response to the heat stimulations—one is how intense or strong the heat stimulation feels, and the other is how unpleasant or disturbing it is.” Participants were told that the present study was concerned with this second aspect of discomfort and that they should make their ratings based on how distressing or unpleasant they found the heat stimulations to be" 

Session 2: 
-Participants came to the session without their partners
-Two levels of heat stimulation: consisting of her threshold temperature (“moderate” pain) and her thres- hold temperature plus 1 °C (“high” pain) 
- 6 seconds of pain, followed by 7seconds break for 80 seconds
Three different conditions (counterbalanced)
- Four Photographs each of 1) attachment figures or controls 2) a chair or a3) a male stranger roughly matching partner's height, age, and weight. shown continuously for the 80s period
Pain rating made after each pain stimulus. 

H1: viewing pictures of the relationship partner (vs. control images) would reduce the threatening experience of physical pain, resulting in lower ratings of pain unpleasantness; 
H2: viewing pictures of the relationship partner (vs. control images) would reduce neural activity in regions previously associated with the unpleasantness of physical pain (dACC and anterior insula (25–27); 
H3: viewing pictures of the partner would lead to greater activity in the VMPFC, a region associated with safety signaling; and 
H4: greater VMPFC activity would be associated with reduced pain ratings and reduced activity in pain-related neural regions.
(11722)

Note: safety signaling versus reward reward processes
VMPFC also plays a role in reward experience. But, research on safety signaling and fear extinction processes
typically have yielded VMPFC activity without other reward-related regions such as the ventral striatum (11–14) and have shown that the ventral striatum is not needed for safety-signaling processes (33) (11722)

Is the experience of viewing attachment figures during pain more of a safety-signaling process or a rewarding experience? 

Can it be both???

Results:
H1:
as predicted, viewing partner pictures had pain-attenuating effects (self-report), and these effects were more pronounced during the high-pain trials.

H2: Pain-related neural activity?
As expected, participants showed significantly less activity in the dACC ROI and bilateral anterior insula ROI, while viewing partner vs. control pictures during the high-pain trials. Although in the right direction, these effects were not significant during the moderate- pain trials (P {\textgreater} 0.15). Thus, consistent with the self-report data, there was reduced activity in pain-related neural regions while viewing partner vs. control pictures during pain, and this effect was most pronounced in the high-pain trials (11723)

H3: Partner pictures and VMPFC?
Analysed partner versus stranger responses
Participants showed greater activity in theVMPFC in response to viewing partner vs. stranger pictures during pain. They also showed greater activity in the premotor cortex. There were no other regions that were more active during partner vs. stranger viewing.

Interestingly, consistent with the hypothesis that VMPFC ac-
tivity signals attachment-related safety, participants in longer- term relationships (categorized by the number of years together: 1=1 y or less; 2=1–2 y; up to 8=more than 7 y) showed greater activity in this same VMPFC cluster (r = 0.43, P {\textless} 0.05).

More- over, participants who rated their partner as being a more sig- nificant source of support showed marginally more activity in this VMPFCcluster as well (r=0.35, P=0.08).* (Relationship length and perceived partner support were not significantly correlated: r = 0.13, ns).

given the role of the VMPFC in safety signaling and its correlation with relationship length and partner support in the current study, it is possible that the VMPFC activation observed in this task is related to the value of the partner as a safety signal (11723).

H4: Will Activation Be Associated with Reduced Pain Ratings and Reduced Pain-Related Neural Activity?

The VMPFC cluster identified above (−6,51,−15) was found to correlate negatively with pain ratings (r = −0.43, P {\textless} 0.05). 
to the extent that the VMPFC was more active while viewing partner pictures, self-reported pain distress was diminished.
AlthoughVMPFC activity did not correlate negatively with activity in the full dACC or anterior insula ROIs, results revealed a cluster within the dACC ROI (6,24,18, t = 4.49, P {\textless} 0.005, k = 12) that correlated negatively with VMPFC activity 
VMPFC activity was more strongly negatively correlated with this region of the dACC during the partner-viewing trials than during the stranger-viewing trials. Moreover, activation in this dACC cluster correlated pos- itively with pain ratings during partner vs. stranger trials (r=0.35, P=0.08)
Although the results are not conclusive, it is possible that the VMPFC contributes to reduced activity in regions that are involved in the distressing experience of physical pain, such as the dACC.

Discussion:

building on these previous findings, viewing partner vs. control pictures while receiving high levels of pain led to significantly less activity in the dACC and bilateral anterior insula, regions associated with the unpleasantness of physical pain in the current study and others (25–27). Although it could be argued that these partner-related reductions in pain were caused by greater distraction by the part- ner images, a previous behavioral study using this same paradigm ruled out this possibility by showing no differences in reaction times to a probe stimulus in any of the conditions

VMPFC activity associated with longer relationship lengths and perception of partner as greater source of social support.

Greater VMPFC was associated with reduced pain ratings, and reduced activity in the dACC which then may re- late to reductions in pain-related or distress-related experience as well as reduced activity in the neural regions that process these experiences.


Learned safety: as in, it must be conditioned, learned,
unlike prepared fear stimuli, in which the specific
feared stimulus does not need to be learned and is likely to be universal (e.g., most individuals should show fear of snakes), in the case of attachment figures as prepared safety stimuli, the specific attachment figure does need to be learned and most certainly will not be universal (e.g., not everyone will show safety responses to the same person)

The idea is not that a specific person is a prepared stimulus but rather that the prepared stimulus is a schema or placeholder in the attachment behavioral system that then becomes occupied by a specific attachment figure who serves as a secure base or source of safety (11725)

How a certain individual comes to occupy that prepared slot is still not clear; however, recent work shows that it may occur, in part, through being comforted following distressing experiences.

Thus, a specific attachment figure may come to occupy this prepared slot in the attachment system by providing safety during times of threat.

For instance, pairing a distressing stimulus with a smiling face has been shown to lead to greater thoughts of attachment security than pairing a neutral stimulus with a smiling face

Pain as the social glue: why is pain the necessary glue for prosociality? 

mu-opioids:
$\mu$-opioids, which are known to be released in re-
sponse to positive, close social contact (42), have been shown to play a role in both fear acquisition and fear extinction or learned safety. Thus, blocking endogenous $\mu$-opioid neurotransmission enhances the acquisition of conditioned fear (43) and impairs the acquisition of extinction or learned safety (44–46)

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The placebo effect, or response, has evolved from being thought of as a nuisance in clinical and pharmacological research to a biological phenomenon worthy of scientific investigation in its own right. The study of the placebo effect and of its negative counterpart, the nocebo effect, is basically the study of the psychosocial context around the treatment and the patient, and it plays a crucial role in the therapeutic outcome. METHODS: In recent years, different types of placebo responses have been analyzed with sophisticated biological tools that have uncovered specific mechanisms at the anatomical, physiological, biochemical and cellular level. RESULTS: Most of our knowledge about the neurobiological mechanisms of the placebo response comes from pain and Parkinson's disease, whereby the neuronal circuits involved in placebo responsiveness have been identified. In the first case, opioidergic, dopaminergic and cholecystokinergic networks have been found to be involved. In the second case, dopaminergic activation in the striatum and neuronal changes in basal ganglia have been described. CONCLUSION: This recent research has revealed that these placebo-induced biochemical and cellular changes in a patient's brain are very similar to those induced by drugs. This new way of thinking may have profound implications both for clinical trials and for medical practice.},

Although social play is very pleasurable, it is more than just a frivolous activity: it is crucial for the development of behavioral flexibility, the acquisition of social and cognitive competence, and the maintenance of group cohesion. Social play is a natural reinforcer, and the neurotransmitter systems intimately implicated in the motivational, pleasurable and cognitive aspects of natural and drug rewards, such as opioids, endocannabinoids, dopamine and norepinephrine, play an important modulatory role in the performance of social play. In this review, we address the notion that social play is rewarding, and discuss recent developments in the neuropharmacology of this behavior. This provides a framework to understand how the brain processes social emotions, to make young individuals enjoy social play.},

While there is evidence to suggest that synchronized movements lead to increased affiliative behavior (Hove {\&} Risen, 2009; Valdesolo {\&} DeSteno, 2011; Wiltermuth {\&} Heath, 2009), the influence of other interpersonal cues has yet to be fully controlled. The current study controls for these features by using computer algorithms to replace human partners. By removing genuine interpersonal interaction, it also tests whether sounds alone can influence affiliative relationships, when it appears that another human agent has triggered those sounds. Results suggest that subjective experience of synchrony had a positive effect on a measure of trust, but task success was a similarly good predictor. An objective measure of synchrony was only related to trust in conditions where participants were instructed to move at the same time as stimuli.},

Recent work shows that exercise activates the eCB system in humans and other mammals, suggesting eCBs are partly responsible for the reported improvements in mood and affect following aerobic exercise in humans. However, exercise-induced psychological changes reported by runners are known to be dependent on exercise intensity, suggesting that any underlying molecular mechanism should also change with varying levels of exercise intensity. Here, we examine circulating levels of eCBs following aerobic exercise (treadmill running) in recreationally fit human runners at four different intensities. We show that eCB signaling is indeed intensity dependent, with significant changes in circulating eCBs observed following moderate intensities only (very high and very low intensity exercises do not significantly alter circulating eCB levels). Our results are consistent with intensity-dependent psychological state changes with exercise and therefore support the hypothesis that eCB activity is related to neurobiological effects of exercise. Thus, future studies examining the role of exercise-induced eCB signaling on neurobiology or physiology must take exercise intensity into account.},

abstract = {The runner's high describes a euphoric state resulting from long-distance running. The cerebral neurochemical correlates of exercise-induced mood changes have been barely investigated so far. We aimed to unravel the opioidergic mechanisms of the runner's high in the human brain and to identify the relationship to perceived euphoria. We performed a positron emission tomography "ligand activation" study with the nonselective opioidergic ligand 6-O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-6-O-desmethyldiprenorphine ([(18)F]FDPN). Ten athletes were scanned at 2 separate occasions in random order, at rest and after 2 h of endurance running (21.5 +/- 4.7 km). Binding kinetics of [(18)F]FDPN were quantified by basis pursuit denoising (DEPICT software). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) was used for voxelwise analyses to determine relative changes in ligand binding after running and correlations of opioid binding with euphoria ratings. Reductions in opioid receptor availability were identified preferentially in prefrontal and limbic/paralimbic brain structures. The level of euphoria was significantly increased after running and was inversely correlated with opioid binding in prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral insula, parainsular cortex, and temporoparietal regions. These findings support the "opioid theory" of the runner's high and suggest region-specific effects in frontolimbic brain areas that are involved in the processing of affective states and mood.},
annote = {findings support the ‘‘opioid theory'' of the runner's high and suggest region-specific effects in frontolimbic brain areas that are involved in the processing of affective states and mood.

The most favored theory, the ‘‘endorphin hypothesis'' (Morgan 1985), ascribes these psychophysical effects to changes in central opioidergic transmission.

There are 3 major types of endorphins.

1. b-Endorphins found primarily in the pituitary gland and released into the blood steam
2 {\&} 3. are the enkephalins and dynorphin, both distributed throughout many different structures of the CNS. 

All the endorphins carry variable affinities for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors.

mu-receptor activation has been linked to the generation of euphoria, kappa-receptor activation is more likely to result in dysphoric mood states (Bodnar 2007).



Results:

Changes in central opioid receptor binding after 2 h of long-distance running were identified preferentially in prefrontal and limbic/ paralimbic brain regions

frontolimbic circuits are known to play a key role in emotional processing (Dalgleish 2004)

the main effect of physical exercise on opioidergic release is fundamentally different compared with induction of temporary sadness states, as elicited by recall of emotionally negative autobiographical events (Zubieta et al. 2003).

Whereas sadness states are associated with deactivations in l-opioid neurotransmission in limbic structures (including rostral anterior cingulate, ventral pallidum, and amygdala), physical exercise is associated with opioidergic activation in frontolim- bic brain regions.

the perceived levels of euphoria were inversely correlated with opioid binding in prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral insula, and parainsular cortex, along with temporopar- ietal regions.

work in rats showing that running can alter opiate cerebrospinal fluid levels (Hoffmann et al. 1990) and receptor occupancy (Tendzegolskis et al. 1991; Aravich et al. 1993).

On the behavioral level, it has been demonstrated in mice subjected to a regular swimming schedule that naloxone induces withdrawal symp- toms similar to those following chronic morphine treatment (Christie and Chesher 1982) and forced swimming in cold water has been shown to cause brain decreases in
[3H]diprenorphine binding (Seeger et al. 1984)

Different research groups have reported up to 5-fold increases of plasma b-endorphin levels after physical exercise (Carr et al. 1981; Farrell et al. 1982; Wildmann et al. 1986)

peripheral opioid levels most likely do not reflect those in the CNS (Rossier et al. 1977; Dietrich and McDaniel 2004).

Dopamine? 
It can be assumed that euphoria is associated with reward, especially in runners with repetitive experiences of euphoric sensations related to endurance training. Hence, one might have expected changes in opioidergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens, a key structure for reward processing with known opioid--dopamine interactions. Although we did not observe relevant running-related opioidergic changes in this brain structure, it might be feasible to detect such changes in the dopaminergic system. This has been attempted by Wang et al. (2000) using [11C]raclopride PET to study striatal dopamine release in healthy volunteers running on a treadmill for 30 min. These authors could not show such changes in the dopaminergic system. However, no psychophysical data were acquired and it is therefore not clear whether the treadmill running induced euphoria and/or reward in these volunteers.

Therefore, it remains to be shown how the dopaminergic system behaves in prolonged physical exercise with induction of euphoria, as studied here

amount of opioidergic release in frontolimbic brain structures is tightly linked to the degree of affective modulation
Knowing that frontolimbic circuits are pivotal for the generation of affect and mood states, we conclude that this differential release of endogenous opioids in relation to perceived euphoria is very likely responsible for the generation of the runner's high sensation.

As antinociceptive effects in runners have been described (Janal et al. 1984; Koltyn 2000) and these effects are thought to be predominantly mu- dependent, it might be deduced that the observed changes in opioid receptor availability are at least partly mu- related

but also the addictive aspects of excessive sports, where injured athletes continue their training in spite of detrimental consequences to their health (Chapman and De Castro 1990)

interactions between endogenous opioids and other neurotransmitter systems and modulators, particularly dopamine and endocan- nabinoids (Dietrich and McDaniel 2004; Gardner 2005).},

annote = {Early China, as told to us through the textual record, was not one of atheistic humanism but rather was a diverse panoply of various paradigms, idioms, and practices held by diverse communities separated both geographically and temporally.

Cognitive science rejects the assumption that cultural groups are radically different.

Studies show that our common biological heritage and relatively similar environments produce both relatively similar minds and relatively similar beliefs.

humans have a natural tendency to believe in gods; Belief in gods naturally arises when certain common cognitive faculties are stimulated



A culture without gods is as much to be expected as a culture without beliefs in other persons or the external world.

China's High Dieties:

Di 帝,
Shangdi 上帝, and 
Tian 天

pre-Qin (pre-221 BCE) period: High Deities are represented in pre-Qin texts, as punishers and rewarders


Belief: 1. hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD) (Barrett)
{\&} 2.Theory of Mind (ToM) 

If ordinary agents—animals and enemies—are unsuited to account for one's experiences, one might find oneself immediately believing in extraordinary, supernatural personal beings, including ghosts, angels, or gods. And then HADD quickly gives way to ToM: these agents have reasons for the things they do. Surely only a very powerful, minded agent could cause such extraordinary events (and for extraordinary reasons), so we attribute super qualities—super powers and super knowledge, for example—to the causes of super events

certain sorts of beliefs seem to have an advantage because they explain a wide variety of phenomena (sustainability) and, because they are surprisingly different from most beliefs are easy to remember and pass on to future generations (transmissibility).


Punitive, Moralising Gods - internalisation of ethical dissonance

Belief in a supernatural punisher would transfer the “costs” of detection and punishment to (a) nonhuman agent(s), thereby reducing the human costs. 

In order to prevent cheaters, such agents must have access to strategic information—they must be super- knowing about defections or cooperations that are hidden from merely human agents.

The bottom line: groups of god-fearing individuals will outcompete groups of nonbelievers (assuming roughly equal size and complexity).

Evidence:
Studies show increased voluntary payment (when no one is watching) when the collection can has eyes drawn on it, and less cheating on computer-assisted exams when virtual eyeballs float on the screen (Bateson et al. 2006). 

When children are prompted with ghost- beliefs, they are less likely to give in to temptation when no one else is in the room. 

Religious groups with costly religious rituals show remark- ably higher levels of cooperation and last vastly longer than secular groups (Sosis and Ruffle 2003).

Dominic Johnson's survey of 186 people groups showed an extremely high correlation between coop- eration and belief in moralizing high gods (2005: 410–446).

The evolutionary psychology of religion suggests that religious beliefs that have been chan- neled into moralizing high gods can effectively overcome human selfishness necessary for the gain of cooperative benefits.

High Dieties of Pre-Qin Texts:
ritual functional agents of shen 神 and the ephemeral gui 鬼 to the diverse angry spirits, forces, and malevolencies, many texts from this time reveal a rich and diverse lexicon and dis- course on the extrahuman.

Di 帝 and Shangdi 上帝, which are understood as two different terms referring to the same agent, and Tian 天; these “High Deities” rule above this panoply of lesser deities (Loewe 2005: 17)

Etymologically, Keightly notes how the term Di, itself, can simply mean “sovereign,” with the Shang of Shangdi indicated “superior,” and was also employed in the names of the Shang kings and the mythological rulers of China and thus has a clear etymological association with socio-political power.

agents are understood in high, if not pre-eminent, positions in sacrificial pantheons and are often invoked as reflecting or related to those with socio-political authority

These punishments and rewards are quite numerous, and when compared with other categories of repre- sentations seen in the database have proven to be the most variable. 

These agents issue forth generic punishments fa 罰 or calamities huo 禍 upon individuals or groups.

the rewards can also be generic, usually described as simply good fortune fu 褔 or assistance zhu 助.

More specific rewards range from these agents bestowing mate- rial rewards,10 fecundity,11 longevity,12 internal powers and strengths,13 portents and omens,14 alleviating problems,15 and even sagehood or transcendent states.16

These agents also inflict specific punishments including famines, droughts and plagues,17 disruptions to the natural world,18 psychological problems,19 abandonment,20 and murder.2

One of the most common forms of punishment and reward is that
of socio-political power.

The sovereign is often both the intended audience of many of these texts and the subject who suffers these punishments or gains these rewards. Passages commonly show the sovereign's house or state collapsing through either unspecified means or invasion.

These reasons are often of a moral dimension wherein the subjects are rewarded for proper behavior, usually for displaying virtue de 德, righteousness yi 義, and sincerity xin 信.

Consequently, subjects who do not possess these qualities or are said to have transgressions zui 罪 are punished.

One of the most marked differences evidenced by Tables 2 and 3 versus Table 4 is the greater representation of Tian as an extrahuman compared with Di and Shangdi.

Furthermore, the number of texts where Tian is represented as punisher or rewarder is much greater—

Transition from Daoism to Confucianism? 
Tian being a punisher or rewarder in com- parison to the total number of passages where the extrahuman Tian is represented varies by text, as seen in the final column, being 75 percent of all cases in the Mengzi to only 7 percent in the Yijing.

Table 4 also shows a strong association between representations of Tian as a moralizing agent alongside punishment and reward. In the sixteen texts that represent Tian as a punisher or rewarder, only three, the Guliang zhuan, Analects (Lunyu), and Yijing, do not show any additional representation as a moralizing agent.

When looking only at Tables 2 and 3, one sees a greater restriction of Di and Shangdi as punishers and rewarders in texts

The passages in these texts, too, generally represent Di and Shangdi in the capacity of moral providence. 

As seen in column 4 of these tables, this is observed in almost all cases, save for the Guoyu which never represents Shangdi in terms of punishment and reward and moral providence in the same passage

When looking at this limited corpus as a whole, one observes that these texts share little in common in terms of providence and authorship and represent texts from the entire breadth of the pre-Qin period. Furthermore, when compared with Table 4, save for the Chuci, all represent Tian as an extrahuman and a punisher and rewarder in addition

This statistical information strongly supports the presence of
idioms and paradigms related to supernatural punishment theory in pre-Qin texts. As cognitive science would hold, these representations seem to be relatively widespread throughout the corpus of pre-Qin texts.

THE CASE OF THE MOZI
Scholars of Chinese philosophy have long claimed the Mozi as an
“uncharacteristic” text for its highly anthropomorphized, extrahuman agents.

Mozi argues “that men will act morally only if they cease to regard changes of fortune as their destiny, and come to recognize that Heaven [Tian] and the spirits reward the good and punish the wicked” (Graham 1978:13–14)

constant contrasting of the ideas of the text to those found in the “Confucian” texts:

“Confucian” texts, he claims, question whether these extrahuman agents exist and adhere to a more secular philosophy in line with Gernet and Y{\"{u}}. The Mozi, then, is unique in its assertion of extrahuman agents like Tian as divine punishers and rewarders (1978: 13–14).

the Mozi itself is full of criticisms of ideas put forward by characters identified with the philosophical figure of Confucius such as Mencius. For example, in a dialogue between Mencius and Mozi, Mencius raises ideas about the lack of deities in ritual only to be refuted by Mozi (2006b: 48.690).

But to assume that this is a discourse against all things “Confucian” is mislead- ing—no such distinction is present in this specific passage nor are texts labeled as “Confucian” bereft of extrahumans.

The master had an audience with Nanzi, and Zilu was not pleased. The Master swore an oath, saying, “If I have done anything wrong, may Heaven [Tian] punish me! May Heaven [Tian] punish me!”24 子見南子，子路不說。夫子矢之曰：「予所否者，天厭之！天
厭之！」2

Mengzi VA. 5, Wan Zhang 萬章 asks Mencius how it was that the king Shun came to be given the throne.

extrahuman agents are identified
with proper moral behavior and also search for it in others. Furthermore, they are observed to operate as agents, of their own accord, and to select rulers that show proper moral conduct and to attempt to rectify the behavior of those of ill repute by issuing them warnings.

However, in other poems of the Shijing, notably Ban板, Huangyi皇
矣, and Sangrou 桑柔, elements of such idioms do present themselves. Ban follows a similar rhetorical structure to Tianbao, by stating what Tian, or in the opening stanza Shangdi, does in the opening line of each stanza, describing how Shangdi “has reversed [His usual course of proce- dure]”34 and Tian is “now sending down calamities,”35 “now exercising oppression”,36 and “is now displaying its anger,”


CONCLUSION
This is not an understanding isolated to specific texts, or portions of texts, that represent a particular genre of literature (say, “Confucian”)or period of time within the pre-Qin corpus, but rather representation that can be found throughout numerous different texts from the beginnings of Chinese literature, as seen in the Shangshu and Shijing to the end of theWarring States and the dawn of Imperial China in the L{\"{u}}shi chunqiu





Tian is portrayed as possessing strategic information—an awareness of morally significant behaviors (which may or may not be visible to human agents). Based on the gathering of this strategic information, punishment and reward are justly distributed},

We examined the possibility that painful experiences can promote cooperation within social groups.

In Experiment 3, we induced pain by asking some participants to eat a hot chili pepper. Participants performed these tasks in small groups. We found evidence for a causal link: Sharing painful experiences with other people, compared with a no-pain control treatment, promoted trusting interpersonal relationships by increasing perceived bonding among strangers (Experiment 1) and increased cooperation in an economic game (Experiments 2 and 3). Our findings shed light on the social effects of pain, demonstrating that shared pain may be an important trigger for group formation.},

@article{Dunbar2010a,
abstract = {Grooming is a widespread activity throughout the animal kingdom, but in primates (including humans) social grooming, or allo-grooming (the grooming of others), plays a particularly important role in social bonding which, in turn, has a major impact on an individual's lifetime reproductive fitness. New evidence from comparative brain analyses suggests that primates have social relationships of a qualitatively different kind to those found in other animal species, and I suggest that, in primates, social grooming has acquired a new function of supporting these. I review the evidence for a neuropeptide basis for social bonding, and draw attention to the fact that the neuroendrocrine pathways involved are quite unresolved. Despite recent claims for the central importance of oxytocin, there is equally good, but invariably ignored, evidence for a role for endorphins. I suggest that these two neuropeptide families may play different roles in the processes of social bonding in primates and non-primates, and that more experimental work will be needed to tease them apart.},
annote = {neurohormonal underpinning of social bonding involves the oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP):
- Oxytocin and vasopressin are closely related nonapeptides that seem to play a role in the processes of pairbonding in mammals (Young, 2000). These two neuropeptides are biochemically very similar to each other: they differ by just two positions, the genes that code for them are located on the same chromosomet. 

-Moreover, the locations within the supraoptic and para-ventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus that produce oxytocin (and the magnocellular neurons that convey it away from the hypothalamus to receptor sites elsewhere in the brain) lie directly adjacent to the ones that produce vasopressin (Moore and Lowry, 1998). 

- Oxytocin is particularly heavily involved in mammalian reproduction, playing an especially crucial role in enabling the birth process and, subsequently, lactation. In contrast, vasopressin is mainly implicated in the body's control of water balance and urinary function

- Despite being present (and physiologically active in other
respects) in both sexes, oxytocin and vasopressin seem to play sex- specific roles in the social domain, with oxytocin being active in females and vasopressin in males. 

- Experimentally manipulating the density of vasopressin receptors in the ventral pallidum using viral vectors, for example, directly affects the strength of partner preference in the absence of mating in male voles (Pitkow et al., 2001; Lim et al., 2004). 

Similarly, Lim et al. (2004) found that it was possible to greatly increase the frequency of huddling with a partner (pairbond-like behaviour) in the normally polygamous male meadow vole by using a viral transplant of vasopressin genes into the ventral forebrain. 

In contrast, oxytocin seems to play this role in female voles (Carter et al., 1995; Insel and Young, 2000)

substantial literature linking oxytocin to mothering beha- viour in mammals, including humans (Uvnas-Moberg, 1996; Uvnas-Moberg and Eriksson, 1996).

In women, oxytocin titres following natural birth are correlated with changes in personality, including greater levels of calmness, sociability and tolerance of monotony, but not with cortisol levels (Uvnas-Moberg et al., 1990;Nissen et al., 1998).

Like the endorphins, oxytocin and vasopressin have a very wide taxonomic distribution, albeit usually in slightly different forms: It has been suggested that all these derive originally from a single neuropeptide widely distributed in variable form among the invertebrates, which underwent duplication early in vertebrate evolution to produce the two families as we now have them (Hoyle, 1999)

oxytocin (at least) has analgesic and reward properties. In rats, high doses of oxytocin give rise to a sedative- like effect, including lowered blood pressure and reduced locomotion (Uvnas-Moberg, 1998; Peterssen et al., 1998a,b), while
the physical stimulation of suckling itself produces anti-stress effects that include a lowered blood pressure and a decreased parasympathetic tone (Uvnas-Moberg and Eriksson, 1996; Uvnas-Moberg, 1998) very similar to those produced by social grooming

some direct evidence to suggest that oxytocin may be associated with physical touch. Agren et al. (1995) found that massage-like stroking of rats' abdomens raised plasma oxytocin levels This was associated with enhanced tolerance of pain (as measured by latency to withdraw from heat or respond to mechanical stimulation).

Similarly, in women, the reported frequency of physical contact (hugs) with partners was correlated with elevated oxytocin levels and lowered blood pressure (Light et al., 2005).

Oxytocin also plays a role in ameliorating stress. Amico et al. (2004) reported that female oxytocin-deficient mice were more nervous in novel environments and had higher stress levels (indexed by corticosterone titres) in response to environ-mental stressors than did wild-type mice, and that these symptoms could be alleviated by injecting oxytocin directly into the cerebral ventricles. 

vasopressin has been found to have a significant effect on aspects of social memory in male mice: vasopressin VIa receptor knockout (VIaRKO) males show a marked impairment of social (but not spatial)memory compared to wild-types (Bielsky et al., 2004)
(habituationof the olfactory investigation response to a familiar ovariectomised female, andsubsequentdishabituation to a novel female)

vasopressin receptors in the lateral septum, but not themedial amygdala, are critical for social recognition; moreover, function could be recovered by a viral vector to induce VIaR re-expression in the lateral septum in VIaR knockouts.

over-expression of VIaR in the lateral septum of wild-type mice resulted in an increase in anxiety-like behaviours, as well as a significant improvement in social recognition.

social recognition of potential mates is clearly important in social life, but it is not the same thing as sociality in the bonded sensewe discussed above in relation to primates.

OT, AVP and Primates:
Bales et al. (2007) recently used neuroimaging to show that two brain areas specifically associated with OT and AVP uptake (the nucleus accumbens and the ventral pallidum) are especially active in male titi monkeys when these are first paired with a novel female.


Discussion: 
Taken together, these findings suggest that oxytocin (but not
vasopressin?) might function in a similar way to endorphins in producing a sense of calmness and contentedness

sincemost of the circumstances that stimulate the production of oxytocin (mating, birth, breastfeeding, stroking) all involve mechanical stress, and are thus also likely to trigger the release of endorphins

Since neuroendocrines often operate in cascades, it is far from clear just which neuropeptide is having which effect, especially since almost all studies focus on only one or other of these neuropeptides

Indeed, in addition to endorphins and oxtocyin/ vasopressin, there is evidence for possible roles for dopamine and serotonin (Depue and Morrone-Strupinsky, 2005)and perhaps even norepinephrine (Nelson and Panksepp, 1998)in these bonding processes.

one of the central problems in this area has been that researchers have typically partitioned out into two non-
overlapping camps (those who favour oxytocin [?vasopressin] and thosewhofavour endorphins), and so far little attempt has beenmade to experimentally tease apart the psycho-pharmacological effects of these two nonapeptide families (see also Depue and Morrone- Strupinsky, 2005).

experimental studies have revealed, for example, that nasal inhalation of oxytocin significantly enhances levels of trust and cooperation in economic games in humans (Zak et al., 2004; Kosfeld et al., 2005). However, laughter (which is an effective mechanism for stimulating endorphin release) also increases cooperation levels in these kinds of games (van Vugt et al., submitted for publication).

The evidence suggests that the effectiveness of oxytocin (at least) wanes quite rapidly after first contact (Carter et al., 1995;Wallner et al., 2006). Since oxytocin is known both to increase rates of social contact and to stimulate grooming (Witt et al., 1992; Argioglas and Gessa, 1991), it could well be that oxytocin's role is simply to facilitate the social engagement needed to bring about the endorphin release that is actually critical to social bonding.},

If mimicry is schema driven, then the operation of these schemas should be disrupted if partners behave in counternormative ways, such as mimicking people they generally would not or vice versa, rendering social interaction inefficient and demanding more executive and self-regulatory resources. To test this hypothesis, Experiments 1-3 used a resource-depletion paradigm in which participants performed a resource-demanding task after interacting with a confederate who mimicked them or did not mimic them. Experiment 1 demonstrated impaired task performance among participants who were not mimicked by a peer. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect and also demonstrated a significant reversal in social contexts where mimicry is counternormative, suggesting that inefficiency emerges from schema inconsistency, not from the absence of mimicry per se. Experiment 4 used a divided attention paradigm and found that resources are taxed throughout schema-inconsistent interactions. These findings suggest that much-needed resources are preserved when the amount of mimicry displayed by interacting individuals adheres to norms, whereas resources are depleted when mimicry norms are violated.},

abstract = {Behavioral mimicry--the automatic imitation of gestures, postures, mannerisms, and other motor movements--is pervasive in human interactions. The current review focuses on two recent themes in the mimicry literature. First, an analysis of the moderators of mimicry uncovers the various motivational, social, emotional, and personality factors that lead to more or less mimicry of an interaction partner in a given situation. Second, a significant amount of recent research has identified important downstream consequences of mimicking or being mimicked by another person. These include not only increased prosociality between interactants, but also unexpected effects on the individual, such as cognitive processing style, attitudes, consumer preferences, self-regulatory ability, and academic performance. Behavioral mimicry is also placed in its broader context: a form of interpersonal coordination. It is compared to interactional synchrony and other social contagion effects, including verbal, goal, and emotional contagion and attitudinal convergence.},

abstract = {Neuroscience research during the past ten years has fundamentally changed the traditional view of the motor system. In monkeys, the finding that premotor neurons also discharge during visual stimulation (visuomotor neurons) raises new hypotheses about the putative role played by motor representations in perceptual functions. Among visuomotor neurons, mirror neurons might be involved in understanding the actions of others and might, therefore, be crucial in interindividual communication. Functional brain imaging studies enabled us to localize the human mirror system, but the demonstration that the motor cortex dynamically replicates the observed actions, as if they were executed by the observer, can only be given by fast and focal measurements of cortical activity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation enables us to instantaneously estimate corticospinal excitability, and has been used to study the human mirror system at work during the perception of actions performed by other individuals. In the past ten years several TMS experiments have been performed investigating the involvement of motor system during others' action observation. Results suggest that when we observe another individual acting we strongly 'resonate' with his or her action. In other words, our motor system simulates underthreshold the observed action in a strictly congruent fashion. The involved muscles are the same as those used in the observed action and their activation is temporally strictly coupled with the dynamics of the observed action.},

@article{Blakemore2005,
abstract = {It has been proposed that actions are intrinsically linked to perception. The idea behind these theories is that observing, imagining or in any way representing an action excites the motor programs used to execute that same action. There is neurophysiological evidence that neurons in premotor cortex of monkeys respond both during movement execution and during the observation of goal-directed action ('mirror neurons'). In humans, a proportion of the brain regions involved in executing actions are activated by the mere observation of action (the 'mirror system'). In this paper, we briefly review recent empirical studies of the mirror system, and discuss studies demonstrating interference effects between observed and executed movements. This interference, which might be a form of 'motor contagion', seems to arise specifically from the observation of biological movements, whether or not these movements are goal-directed. We suggest that this crude motor contagion is the first step in a more sophisticated predictive system that allows us to infer goals from the observation of actions.},

abstract = {Social neuro-science has recently started to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying our ability to understand the mental and emotional states of others. In this review, imaging research conducted on theory of mind (ToM or mentalizing) and empathy is selectively reviewed. It is proposed that even though these abilities are often used as synonyms in the literature these capacities represent different abilities that rely on different neuronal circuitry. ToM refers to our ability to understand mental states such as intentions, goals and beliefs, and relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex. In contrast, empathy refers to our ability to share the feelings (emotions and sensations) of others and relies on sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures. It is further argued that the concept of empathy as used in lay terms refers to a multi-level construct extending from simple forms of emotion contagion to complex forms of cognitive perspective taking. Future research should investigate the relative contribution of empathizing and mentalizing abilities in the understanding of other people's states. Finally, it is suggested that the abilities to understand other people's thoughts and to share their affects display different ontogenetic trajectories reflecting the different developmental paths of their underlying neural structures. In particular, empathy develops much earlier than mentalizing abilities, because the former relys on limbic structures which develop early in ontogeny, whereas the latter rely on lateral temporal lobe and pre-frontal structures which are among the last to fully mature.},

Empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. In light of multiple levels of analysis ranging from developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical neuropsychology, this article proposes a model of empathy that involves parallel and distributed processing in a number of dissociable computational mechanisms. Shared neural representations, self-awareness, mental flexibility, and emotion regulation constitute the basic macrocomponents of empathy, which are underpinned by specific neural systems. This functional model may be used to make specific predictions about the various empathy deficits that can be encountered in different forms of social and neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Moving a set dinner table often takes two people, and doing so without spilling the glasses requires the close coordination of the two agents' actions. It has been argued that the mirror neuron system may be the key neural locus of such coordination. Instead, here we show that such coordination recruits two separable sets of areas: one that could translate between motor and visual codes and one that could integrate these information to achieve common goals. The former includes regions of the putative mirror neuron system, the latter, regions of the prefrontal, posterior parietal and temporal lobe adjacent to the putative mirror neuron system. Both networks were more active while participants cooperated with a human agent, responding to their actions, compared to a computer that did not, evidencing their social dimension. This finding shows that although the putative mirror neuron system can play a critical role in joint actions by translating both agents' actions into a common code, the flexible remapping of our own actions with those of others required during joint actions seems to be performed outside of the putative mirror neuron system.},

How does complex and seemingly willful behaviour emerge from interactions between millions of neurons? This has long been suspected to depend on the prefrontal cortex--the neocortex at the anterior end of the brain--but now we are beginning to uncover its neural basis. Nearly all intended behaviour is learned and so depends on a cognitive system that can acquire and implement the 'rules of the game' needed to achieve a given goal in a given situation. Studies indicate that the prefrontal cortex is central in this process. It provides an infrastructure for synthesizing a diverse range of information that lays the foundation for the complex forms of behaviour observed in primates.},

If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism--the mirror-neuron mechanism--that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.},

In each case, their function is distinct, sometimes complementary and sometimes oppositional. We argue that implicit processes in social interaction are automatic and are often opposed to conscious strategies. While we are aware of explicit processes in social interaction, we cannot always use them to override implicit processes. Many studies show that implicit processes facilitate the sharing of knowledge, feelings, and actions, and hence, perhaps surprisingly, serve altruism rather than selfishness. On the other hand, higher-level conscious processes are as likely to be selfish as prosocial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many changes in social behavior take place during adolescence. Sexuality and romantic interests emerge during this time, and adolescents spend more time with peers and less time with parents and family. While such changes in social behavior have been well documented in the literature, relatively few neurophysiological explanations for these behavioral changes have been presented.

METHOD: In this article we selectively review studies documenting (a) the neuronal circuits that are dedicated to the processing of social information; (b) the changes in social behavior that take place during adolescence; (c) developmental alterations in the adolescent brain; and (d) links between the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescence and changes in brain physiology occurring at that time.

RESULTS: The convergence of evidence from this review indicates a relationship between development of brain physiology and developmental changes in social behavior. Specifically, the surge of gonadal steroids at puberty induces changes within the limbic system that alters the emotional attributions applied to social stimuli while the gradual maturation of the prefrontal cortex enables increasingly complex and controlled responses to social information.

CONCLUSIONS: Observed alterations in adolescent social behavior reflect developmental changes in the brain social information processing network. We further speculate that dysregulation of the social information processing network in this critical period may contribute to the onset of mood and anxiety disorders during adolescence.},

abstract = {Abstract. A model for the evolution of cooperation shows that two conditions are necessary for cooperation to be stable: a hunting success rate that is low for single hunters and increases with group size, and a social mechanism limiting access to meat by non-hunters. Testing this model on Taı{\&}{\#}x0308; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, showed that (1) it pays for individuals to hunt in groups of three or four rather than alone or in pairs, and (2) cooperation is stable because hunters gain more at these group sizes than cheaters, owing to a meat-sharing pattern in which hunting, dominance and age, in that order, determine how much an individual gets. In addition, hunters provide cheaters (about 45{\%} of the meat eaters) with the surplus they produce during the hunts. Thus, cooperation in Taı{\&}{\#}x0308; male chimpanzees is an evolutionarily stable strategy, and its success allows cheating to be an evolutionarily stable strategy for Taı{\&}{\#}x0308; female chimpanzees. In Gombe chimpanzees, cooperation is not stable, first, because hunting success is very high for single hunters, and second, because no social mechanism exists that limits access to meat by non-hunters. The analysis showed that some assumptions made when discussing cooperation in other social hunters might be wrong. This might downgrade our general perception of the importance of cooperation as an evolutionary cause of sociality.},

annote = {What does the embodied simulation model represent in the context of a broader conception of social cognition as a distributed processes taking place between two or more individuals?

embodied simulation processes correspond to what we refer to sy n c h r o n i z a t i o n processes, namely jointly and simultaneously recruited sensory motor processes that give simultaneous partial access between producer and perceiver at a neural level.

How to biologically bridge the epistemic gulf separating single individuals; what does social cognition cover? and what are the multitude of bridging layers that exist at the behavioural and linguistic level?

the SC model: specifies the interaction between goal driven processes and autonomous and automatic synchronization processes as they shape ideomotor representations and contribute to the formation of motor responses.

social cognition as locked within a brain or between two brains falls into the classic representational fallacy that underestimates, or worse ignores the fact that cognition is for action and that social cognition is for the adaptive regulation of social interaction.

DEVELOPMENTAL EVIDENCE:

If synchronization is an innate social process then such jointly recruited processes should be evidenced at a behavioral level (entrainment) early on in development particularly during a period where goal driven higher decision processes are not yet in place.

Comparative evidence from non-human primates (20): 
research with non-human primates appears to be equivocal. Some suggest that chimpanzees can imitate (Preston {\&} de Waal, 2002) while other studies suggest that extensive training (e.g., Custance et al., 1995) or experience and contact with humans (e.g., Tomasello, 1998, 2003; Whiten, 1998; Whiten et al., 1996) is necessary for imitation.

Social interactions soon take over:
the disappearance of neonatal entrainment also marks the onset of social communicative behavior such as a decrease in neonatal spontaneous smiling and an increase in social smiling (e.g., Tomonaga, et al., 2004),

Neonates:
there is conclusive and reliable evidence for entrainment of tongue p r o tr u s i o n – the most widely studied gesture (see also Heyes, 2001). The likelihood of neonates performing a tongue protrusion gesture increases significantly if they have observed the gesture being performed.

supportive evidence is only reliable in the case of movements of the mouth and face regions then this may not be surprising, given that this is the part of the human body has the highest overall communicative significance in general.

differential mouth movements are produced even when no visual signal is available. This research appears to speak to a hard-wired connection between the motor processes involved in the production and perception of speech. While the evidence with neonates suggests entrainment, a more differentiated picture emerges with older children in the context of research on ‘imitation'

Infants: a more differentiated picture emerges with older children in the context of research on ‘imitation'

six months infants are able to selectively distinguish between human action and object motion and encode a goal of a reaching movement that they observe, which is comparable to more advanced understandings of goal-directed action (Woodward, 1998) and that infants who are 12 months old relate single actions to overarching goals (Woodward {\&} Summerville, 2000).

[hierarchical understanding of action appears to develop very quickly, {\~{}} 6-12mnths]

whether the emergence of goals as significant stimuli constitutes an inhibitory influence upon entrainment.

the presence of a goal (significant stimulus, e.g., a dot) inhibits entrainment under these experimental conditions. 

GOAL DIRECTED ACTION: reduces entrainment, increases turn-taking, mirroring, etc

A prominent one is the Active Intermodal Matching (AIM) model developed by Meltzoff and Moore (1977)

when a body movement is observed the visual representation of the movement is converted to a supramodal representational system 

neonate evidence can be regarded as the
consequence of a stimulus (face with tongue protrusion) driven activation of the synchronization pathway with no inhibitory influences...or for that matter higher order processes such as goals exercising an influence on the emerging mental representations that shape the motor response

As Bekkering et al. (2003) have pointed out; direct-mapping theories
(including mirror neuron simulation models) are unable to account for systematic and consistent deviations from model movements, namely the repeatedly observed
mi r r o r i ma g e ‘imitation' of adult model movements.

Bekkering et al.'s (e.g., 2004)
theory of goal-directed imitation (GOADI): once a goal is selected then it elicits the motor program with which it is most strongly associated (ideomotor principle)

If goals are present (e.g., such as a dot) then they are selected over means (e.g., effectors or movement paths).

the model's explanatory range is restricted and consequently has no conceptual provision for automatic processes such as synchronization

neonate imitation is likely to be automatic and driven by
synchronization (a jointly recruited process). In contrast, research, which falls under explicitly induced imitation, is entrainment and coordination (in our terminology) driven primarily by goal-mediated mental representation inducing motor behavior. 

Examples of such behavior are choral singing, dancing, etc. {\textless}- SPORT !

Entrainment:

The earliest reference to entrainment was by McDougall (1908), who noted that spectators assume the postural manner of athletes they were observing.

Mirroring / Mimicry :

emotion contagion (Hatfield, Cacioppo, {\&} Rapson, 1994), postural sway (e.g., Shockley, Santana, {\&} Fowler, 2003), playing piano (Keller, Knoblich, {\&} Repp, 2007), paralinguistic behaviors (see Giles {\&} Coupland, 1991), the use of syntactic structure by dialogical partners (e.g., Bock, 1986, 1989; Bock {\&} Loebell, 1990), to arbitrary behaviors (e.g., Chartrand {\&} Bargh, 1999) just to name a few

The theoretical frameworks range from individual centered direct, unmediated action-perception models (Dijksterhuis {\&} Bargh, 2001), to non-reductive ecological approaches (Marsh, Richardson, Baron {\&} Schmidt, 2006), to cognitive models of joint action (e.g., Sebanz, Bekkering, {\&} Knoblich, 2006).

Action coordination can take a great variety of manifest forms ranging from, for instance, a dialogue, talking and walking, a soccer game, the performance of open-heart surgery, two people moving a very heavy object, to implementing a war strategy.

Two features of coordination stand out:

One is that the participants in a joint action have to be on the same page regarding the ‘task' at hand, namely share a ‘common ground' and engage in joint action abiding by the rules pertinent to the ‘task' (dialogue, tennis, surgery operation, pushing a large object, etc.) which are quintessential to grounding the task.

The second feature is that joint action is an open system (whatever the task) and can lead to the same result (goal or end state) despite differences in the initial conditions. In other words, coordination is not a determinate path, but is characterized by equifinality.

Entrainment:
the
al i
g n m en t o f b eh
av i
o r s or rh y t h m s
during social interaction
borrowing the term from earlier work (e.g., Condon {\&} Ogston, 1966, 1967)

Entrainment refers to a state between two persons that results when the cyclical behavioral movements of one person influence the cyclical movements of another person and
th e y o s c i l l a te i n r h y th m

A typical example is provided in the spontaneous transition of an applauding audience from disordered clapping to entrained clapping (Neda, Ravasz, Brechet, Vicsek, {\&} Barabasi, 2000) and then back again to disordered clapping only for entrained clapping to reemerge again a little later.

More recent work from an ecological approach also treats interaction as the unit of analysis and draws on human movement science and coupled oscillator theory (see Marsh et al., 2006 for an overview)

This research focuses on behavioral data arguing that an em b o d i ed approach to
uncovering perception action systems resulting in entrainment has to rely on the examination of dynamic properties of actual behavior taking place between individuals, rather than mentalistic, representational constructs.

Coordination and entrainment are simultaneously occurring processes during social interaction. Take for instance a dialogue. Any dialogue features a variety of instances of multimodal coordination as well as multimodal entrainment.

A dialogue can simultaneously manifest
co o r d i n a t i o n as in the
case of turn taking in a conversation (e.g., Sachs, Schegloff, {\&} Jefferson, 1974), or introducing a new topic, as well as
en t r ai n m en t , for instance at a
syntactic level (e.g., syntactic priming, Bock, 1986, 1989; Bock {\&} Loebell, 1990), affective level (e.g., mood contagion, Neumann and Strack, 2000), movement level (e.g., Chartrand {\&} Bargh, 1999), affective facial expressions (e.g., Dimberg, et al., 2000), and breathing movements (e.g., Furuyama, Hayashi, {\&} Mishima, 2005). Coordination

Coordination and entrainment can converge when joint behavior is goal driven (e.g., playing tennis versus choral singing)

be consciously accessible or escape conscious access (two people moving a heavy object versus emotional contagion) or a combination of both

JOINT{\_}ACTION and SC Model:

the goal of joint action along with the type of task environment (social or physical features of the task) contributes to the shape and nature of the joint action.

Traditionally focussed on reaching representational common ground in order for Joint-Action to take place. 

More recently, research has focussed on non-verbal behavioural entrainment and coordination:

Shockley and his colleagues (2003; Shockley, Baker, Richardson, {\&} Fowler, 2007) examined whether conversation fosters interpersonal postural entrainment (postural sway) and revealed that convergent speaking patterns mediate interpersonal postural entrainment (see also Condon {\&} Ogston, 1966; Kendon, 1970; LaFrance, 1982).

Postural sway is not the only behavior that entrains outside of conscious access, but also dialect (Giles, 1973), and speech rate (Street, 1984).

Similarly, pausing frequency (Cappella {\&} Planalp, 1981) has been shown to entrain. Entrainment has also been show to hold for gestural (see Furuyama, Hayashi, {\&} Mishima, 2005) movements of interacting individuals without the individuals intending to entrain, Spontaneous entrainment occurs when interactants have full visual access to each other (cf. joint attention - Sebanz et al., 2006).

the function of such motor mimicking is primarily communicative (Bavelas et al., 1988).

The research evidence to date suggests that mimicry occurs outside of conscious awareness, and without any intent to mimic or imitate.


The link between movement and liking:

One of the interesting consequences of mimicry or entrainment is that it leads to increased liking of an interaction partner (Chartrand {\&} Jefferis, 2003; Dijksterhuis {\&} Bargh, 2001). Indeed, there appears to be reliable evidence for the relationship between entrainment of different types of movements and liking (Bernieri {\&} Rosenthal, 1991; Chartrand {\&} Bargh, 1999; Julien, Brault, Chartrand, {\&} Begin, 2000; LaFrance, 1982; LaFrance {\&} Broadbent, 1976; Lakin {\&} Chartrand, 2003).

Ecological Approach: Coupled Oscillatory Modeling

the unit of analysis is the behavioral interaction and the objective is to model the temporal organization of the movements of two (or more) people

it makes no attempt to understand the neural and psychological forces driving such behavior. 

Thus, specific phenomena such as the affective and motivational precursors as well as consequences of entrainment, the contribution of entrainment and coordination to socially distributed knowledge and more complex multimodal processes such as conversation, dialogue do not currently seem to feature as relevant phenomena in this approach.

The approaches to co-action (e.g., Sebanz et al., 2007; Marsh et al.,
2006) do not speak to how the different pathways activated by significant goals and synchronization processes contribute to the shape of entrainment and coordination.

SC-Model:
1. In the absence of goal activation that recruits coordination (e.g., playing table tennis) synchronization processes (subject to inhibitory and excitatory influences) contributes to the shape of the cognitive, conative and affective mental representations that configure the motor responses of the perceiver. (Arguably, this is what is noted in the mimicry research)
(the result of a semi-stochastic transduction process leading to some periodic entrainment)

The problem so far is that the mimicry research has not yet examined the temporal dynamics of mimicry.

In experimental scenaros: The behaviours of individuals are instructionally induced 

thus supplying a goal and showing systematic temporal dynamics of behavior

though the mechanisms by which the pick-up of information about how the other phases its movements, and how these mechanisms lead to temporal co- organization of movement or entrainment are not of any theoretical interest in this approach (cf. Marsh et al., 2006).


From an ecological perspective the suggestion is that movement is ‘lawfully' constrained by other people's movements (Marsh et al., 2006) and best modeled in terms of coupled oscillator theory without any recourse to any jointly recruited intra-personal processes may these be neural or psychological.

Primates are unusual in that their social relationships are extensive within groups, which often contain many reproductively active males and females. Several hypotheses have been forwarded to explain the ultimate causation of primate sociality. While attention has focused on grooming as a proximate factor influencing social relationships, the neural basis of such behaviour has not been investigated in monkeys. This report presents changes in the brain's opioid system contingent on grooming in monkeys. Opiates themselves have a feedback interaction with grooming behaviour, as revealed from the administration of opiate agonists and antagonists. Opiate receptor blockade increases the motivation to be groomed, while morphine administration decreases it. These data support the view that brain opioids play an important role in mediating social attachment and may provide the neural basis on which primate sociality has evolved.},

The present research investigated whether this is also true when the expressions that are being mimicked do not reflect the other person's true emotions. In interactions, targets either lied or told the truth, while observers mimicked or did not mimic the targets' facial and behavioral movements. Detection of deception was measured directly by observers' judgments of the extent to which they thought the targets were telling the truth and indirectly by observers' assessment of targets' emotions. The results demonstrated that nonmimickers were more accurate than mimickers in their estimations of targets' truthfulness and of targets' experienced emotions. The results contradict the view that mimicry facilitates the understanding of people's felt emotions. In the case of deceptive messages, mimicry hinders this emotional understanding.},

First we will position human unconscious mimicry in relation to types of imitation used in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Then we will provide support for social moderation of mimicry. Characteristics of both the mimicker and the mimickee influence the degree of mimicry in a social interaction. Next, we turn to the positive social consequences of this unconscious mimicry and we will present data showing how being imitated makes people more assimilative in general. In the final section, we discuss what these findings imply for theorizing on the mechanisms of imitation and point out several issues that need to be resolved before a start can be made to integrate this field in the broader context of research on imitation.},

abstract = {We present here a comprehensive, neurocognitive model to account for the psychological consequences of acute exercise. There is a substantial amount of disparate research and the proposed mechanistic explanation meaningfully integrates this body of brain and behavioral data into a single, unified model. The model's central feature is a cascading, two-step process. First, exercise engages arousal mechanisms in the reticular-activating system. This activation process, which involves a number of neurotransmitter systems, has several interrelated effects on cognition and emotion but, in general, has evolved to facilitate implicit information processing. Second, exercise disengages the higher-order functions of the prefrontal cortex. This deactivation process, which is caused in part by resource limitations, also has several interrelated effects but, in general, has evolved to keep the inefficient explicit system and unhelpful emotional processes from compromising the implicit system's functioning when optimal motor execution is needed most. In this article, we review evidence in support of this reticular-activating hypofrontality (RAH) model of acute exercise and place it into a larger evolutionary context.},
annote = {critical distinction between executive functions and other cognitive processes 


Only a model that separates them can begin to disentan- gle the reasons why some cognitive functions are enhanced by exercise, while others are impaired (1306)




acute, not chronic exercise 




P:

Performance on reaction time tasks following acute bouts of aerobic exercise improve accross the board...
irrespective of the type of reaction time task and irrespective of the kind of acute aerobic exercise (1306)



P: Performance on cognitive tasks that substantially recruit executive processes is impaired during acute bouts of aerobic exercise (1306)
eg: "Endurance exercise selectively impairs prefrontal dependent cognition" (Dietrich {\&} Sparling 2004)


Studies using a chronic exercise paradigm have clearly demonstrated that the lasting effect of exercise is the opposite, an improvement of executive processes (Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Hillman et al., 2008). 


exercise induces states of effortless attention and flow (Dietrich, 2004a; Dietrich and Stoll, 2009).


exercise has a positive effect on emotions. In the mod-erate, aerobic range especially, it reduces stress, decreases anxiety, and alleviates depression (Salmon, 2001; Scully et al., 1998 (1306)


Exercise also induces analgesia, sedation, and feelings of well-being (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004). generally calming and (2) typically extend well into the post- exercise period (1307)


P: No one neurotransmitter is the answer to the psychological effects of exercise:


F: serotonin may help explain the antidepressant effects but does not do any explanatory work when it comesto faster reaction time performance orf lowstates;


F: dopamine and norepinephrine can acccount for the arousal component but run counter to any explanation for anxiolysis or sedation (1307)


F: endorphins and endocannabinoids represent a possible mechanism for the sense of well being but are useless for other emotional processes (1307).




Distinction between implicit and explicit systems (1307):


The brain operates two largely independent cognitive systems to acquire and represent information. 



The explicit system: is rule-based, its content can be expressed verbally, and it is tied to conscious awareness.



This echoes the Experiential Phenomenological Self (EPS)



"working memory buffer of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) holds the current content of consciousness, coupled with evidence that the executive attentional network of the DLPFC is the mechanism to select the content suggests that the explicit system is critically dependent on pre-frontal regions" (1307)


Abundant evidence also suggests that medial temporal lobe structures are involved (Poldrack and Packard, 2003)


The explicit system is understood to be a sophisticated system that is capable, thanks mostly to the computational infrastructure in the prefrontal cortex, to represent knowledge in a higher-order or conscious format (1307)







The implicit system: is skill or experience-based, its content is not verbalizable and can only be conveyed through task per- formance, and it is inaccessible to conscious awareness.


The neural substrates of the implicit system are less clear. The basal ganglia, cerebellum,and supplementary motorarea (SMA)have been implicated most often, and they are critical for a type of implicitmemory knownas procedural memory (motor and cognitive skills), but con- tribute to other types as well, such as priming, conditioning, and habituation (Mishkin et al., 1984; Poldrack and Packard, 2003) (1307).


the implicit system is taken to be a moreprimitive and evolutionary ancient system that does not form higher-order representations (Reber, 1989)


The implicit system is not burdened by higher-order representations, which exponentially increase computational complexity (e.g., Sun, 2006).




Given the already high complexity of even the simplest of motor skills, making motor knowledge explicit would become a serious resource issue (1307) (!) 



The amount of information that must be held con- currently in the focus of attention far surpasses the computational limit ofworkingmemory.In contrast, proceduralknowledgeis con- tained in the application of the procedureandneednotbeextracted from general rules that are represented at a higher-order level and then applied to a specific example.


This system echoes the Experiential Enactive Self (EES)

(Vago {\&} Silbersweig 2012).





Evolutionary benefits of implicit efficiency: 





The explicit system, on the other hand, has evolved to increase flexibility but is limited: 


the explicit system owes its flexibility to its capac- ity for abstraction, but it is also exactly this very ability that limits its use for purposes, such as skilled motion, where time is of the essence (Dienes and Perner, 2002; Reber, 1989) (1308).







we must rigorously apply this 

flexibility/efficiency tradeoff 

that exists between the implicit and explicit systems to the computational problem of motor perofrmance"



(1308)



Due to the explicit system's inefficiency and capacity limit, it should be obvious that any amount of transfer of the skill from implicit to explicit execution gravely affects its quality


We can sum up the matter by stating that a well-learned motor skill is performed with maximal efficiency, if it is controlled by the implicit system (Dietrich, 2004b) (1308).


The activation of motor programs requires the engagement of the brainstem's arousal systems. It is not difficult to grasp the evolutionary significance of why, during exercise, these systems are activated. The general purpose of this machinery is 
1. to activate the various nervous and endocrine mechanisms that drive and sus- tain the actual motion and 
2. to boost performance, if ever so slightly, on the sort of mental tasks – reaction time, visual discrimination, simple choice, and so on – that are needed for the kinds of behaviors that, incidentally, also necessitated the exercise – fight-flight situations, most prominently among them (1308).


"we propose that the down regulation of the explicit system evolved in humans to offset the influence of metacognitive processes in the one situation these processes are most definitely not adaptive, when survival requires fast and efficient responding" (1308)


A mechanism that can help minimize explicit processes from compromising thespeed speed and accuracy of the implicit system would have a distinct survival value. This, we submit, is the adaptive purpose of the hypofrontality process (1308). 




a movement can be executed by the explicitsystem and/or the implicit system but an explicit-predominant movement proceeds from a mental representation that is differ- ent in kind from one that is implicit-predominant. 
Since a highly practiced, implicit-predominant skill is still performed by a con- scious person, it is possible for the explicit system to partake in its moment-to-moment execution


The degree of implicitness of motor competence, then, is positively related to the quality of the performance (Dietrich, 2004b).


This problem of interference, we can presuppose, only arises in humans because other animals simply do not have such a highly developed explicit system in the first place that possibly could wreck the smoothness and ease of implicit motor performance


the benefits of chronic, habitual exercise–the sparing of higher cognitive function in aging (Hillman et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2006) – were being discovered at around the same time and this phenomenon would have presented clear problems for a mechanism solely based on neurochemistry


reticular-activating process, as we call thisgroup of arousal mechanisms in our RAH model, is mostly restricted to the facilitation of bottom–up, implicit processes during, and possibly shortly after, exercise



phylogenetically ancient arousal systems evolved to aid decision-making in the phylogenetically older implicit system in situations where only the quick make it to the next round. It did not evolve to affect the explicit system,which our ape ancestors did not have or to protect mental functions in old age, which our ape ancestors did not reach (1309).











The reticular-activating system consists of several distinct but interrelated arousal systems that are differentiated by anatomy (specific nuclei and their projections), neurotransmitter (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, mostly) and function (Robbins and Everitt, 1995)


"It mediates alertness and appears to be involved in detecting sensory signals and maintaining discrimination processes under high levels of arousal and stress" (1310)




Acute exercise and the three monoamine systems:






Increases in (1)
noradrenergic transmission are thought toimprovethe signal-to-noise ratio by enhancing the evoked response, suppress- ing the background activity, or both



(2) The dopaminergic system originates from cell bodies located in the substantia nigra pars compacta and from the ventral tegmentum. It projects to (1) the dorsal and ventral striatum, which, in turn, modulate activity in a large network involving the motor thalamus, SMA, premotor area, and primary motor cortex; (2) several structures in the limbic system, such as the nucleus accumbens; and (3) cortical regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex. (1310)


Together, these pathways activate or energize behaviorandaccountfor the vigorandfrequencyof behavioral outputs (Robbins and Everitt, 2007)



(3) The serotoninergic system originates from cell bodies located in the raphe nucleus and projects from there widely throughout the brain and spinal cord. This system appears to moderate the stimulating effects of catecholamine activity and thus promotes behavioral inhibition and cortical deactivation (1310).



The inverted-U model of performance:

performance is a curvilinear function of arousal, that is, under and overaroused individuals do more poorly while opti- mal performance is associated with a moderate state of arousal (1311)


...the peak of that function can shift in both directions depend- ing on the type of task with simple tasks being less sensitive to arousal variation than complex ones
(1311)


"the inverted-U model has also been observed in dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal function. While low doses of D1 agonists improve performance on tasks tap- ping into prefrontal-dependent cognition, higher doses worsen it (see, Arnsten and Li, 2005) (1311)


the most important shortcoming is the fact that it does not differentiate between different types of cognitive systems (i.e. explicit/implicit). In addition to arousal, it only considers task complexity and difficulty level.



The Kahneman Model:
Kahneman (1973) provided perhaps the first full cognitive-energetic model. This model regards the total amount of resources, which exist in a single, undifferentiated pool, as limited. The availability of resources depends on the level of arousal, which, in turn, is determined by two sources, task demand and several other sources, such as stimulus intensity, psychoactive drugs, anxiety, or, for that matter, exercise (1311)


The model postulates a so-called allocation policy mechanism that directs and supervises the allotment of resources, which, in turn, is determined by such factors as enduring dispositions, momentary intentions, or feedback from on-going activities. The level of arousal, then, corresponds to the amount of available resources and decrements in performance occur when task demands


The Kahneman model assumes that there is a general, non-specific pool of energetic resources that supports all cognitive functions. But such unitary concepts of arousal have outlived their usefulness (1311)


shifted from a unidimensional conception of resources–one unique reservoir [Kahenman Model]–to amultidimensional view that permits the operation of several different supply systems: 



Sanders Model (1983, 1998):

three energetic mechanisms: arousal, activation, and effort. 
Each of these resource pools influences, at the cognitive level, a specific stage of information processing:
Arousal -{\textgreater} sensory perceptual processes
Activation -{\textgreater} motor adjustment stage
Effort -{\textgreater} response selection 



An acute bout of exercise can increase the arousal and/or activation mechanism, which can modulate input (sensory pro- cesses) and/or output (motor processes), respectively.



(1311)


Arousal and activation are two terms that are often used interchangeably but they can be, and should be, uncoupled: Activation differs from arousal, then, in that it affects motor processes by maintaining a tonic readiness to respond.




Problems with the cognitive-energetic models: 



1. Effortless attention and action:
A specific example of this emerging paradigm is the idea of flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996), a situation in which superior performance is associated with a decrease in men- tal effort and attention (Bruya,


E: traditional theories of attention and mental effort for the simple reason that they assume that bet- ter performance, even on a well-learned task, is associated with increased conscious effort allocated to that task (1311)


people describe their action in such a flow state as if it happens by itself, without any effort at all! (1312)


P: The flow phenomenon is not a paradox at all if we uncouple explicit from implicit processes (Dietrich, 2004a). In fact, improvements on well-learned, stimulus-driven tasks can only occur, according to our RAH model, if the explicit system, and thus effort, is decreased.







Exercise and Emotions (1315):



an exercising individual enters, sooner orlater, a mental state marked by a transient decrease in prefrontal function


Several anxiety and depressive disorders show evidence of hyperactivity in some brain regions. In obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) for instance, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), which has been implicated in complex emotions, exhibits widespread hypermetabolism (Baxter, 1990; Baxter et al., 1987), while individuals with post traumatic stress disorder or phobia show hyperactivity in the amygdala (LeDoux, 1996).


excessive activity is thought to generate a state of hyper-vigilance and hyper-awareness leading to anxiety.


depression, which is also marked by hyperactivity in the VMPFC and the amygdala. Conversely, the dorsolateral prefrontal cor- tex (DLPFC), which is associated with higher cognitive functions, shows less than normal activity in depression, depriving the indi- vidual of the higher cognitive abilities that might help mitigate the negative mood. (1315)


Treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors results in a normalization of the malfunctioning of this complex prefrontal circuitry (Mayberg et al., 1995), pointing to an abnormal interaction between the VMPFC and the DLPFC rather than global prefrontal dysfunction (Starkstein and Robinson, 1999) (1315)


Considering the similarities in brain activation, it is not surprising that OCD patients frequently develop comorbid major depression, and that the treat- ment of choice for both disorders is serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Starkstein and Robinson, 1999). 






With the concept of exercise-induced hypofrontality, however, 
a novel neural mechanism by which exercise might be beneficial to mood becomes immediately apparent
. (1316)


the massive neural activity caused by the large-scale bodily motion, coupled with the brain's finite metabolic resources, makes it impossible for the brain to sustain excessive neural activity in structures, such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, that are not needed at the time. As the brain must run on safe mode the very structures that appear to compute the information that engender stress, anxiety, and negative thinking in the first place, we experience relief from life's worries. In other words, without enough metabolic resources to activate the very brain regions that can possibly figure out what, say, today's stock market crash does to your retirement fund, such anxieties are simply less likely to reach consciousness. It is, so to speak, a budget crunch that causes specific phenomenological sub- tractions (for details, see Dietrich, 2003, 2006).(1315)


Dietrich (2006): Transient hypofrontality as a mechanism for the psychological effects of exercise
COPIED TO EVERNOTE



Exercise type, intensity and duration and the RAH Model:



Type: Physical exercise requiring large muscle groups, then, necessitates a greater shift of metabolic resources than exercise that does not


Exercise of higher intensity, then, creates a greater need for reshuffling than exercise of lower intensity. It would follow from this that exercise of maximum intensity involving the whole body generates the highest possible metabolic demands in brain regions associated with the exercise and thus forces the greatest possible downregulation in unrelated brain regions (1316).


Exercise at intensities above the anaerobic threshold cannot be maintained at the muscular level. Accordingly, anaerobic exercise, despite the massive neural changes it brings about, is unlikely to have profound consequences for overall brain function for the simple reason that it is unsustainable, which makes any ensuing psychological effects, albeit intense, limited in time (1316)



Anaerobic exercise is



painful,

unsustainable
Psychological well-being associated with endorphin (endocannabinoid / opioid -ergic systems..)



Duration: The longer the duration of the exercise the longer is the brain required to maintain the lopsided allocation policy that draws resources away from neural areas not pertinent to the exer- cise. In other words, the longer the exercise the more profound is the associated downregulation in these neural areas (1316)


Cerebral perturbation is greatest, therefore, when the exercise involves the entire body and is performed for an extended period at the highest intensity possible for that time frame. 


Cerebral perturbation is greatest, therefore, when the exercise involves the entire body and is performed for an extended period at the highest intensity possible for that time frame. A marathon run at, or just below, the anaerobic threshold is a good example (1316).},

In spite of extensive evidence for a male advantage on a wide variety of navigational tasks, we demonstrate that a simple but ecologically important shift in content can reverse this sex difference. This effect is predicted by and consistent with the theory that a sexual division in ancestral foraging labour selected for gathering-specific spatial mechanisms, some of which are sexually differentiated. The hypothesis that gathering-specific spatial adaptations exist in the human mind is further supported by our finding that spatial memory is preferentially engaged for resources with higher nutritional quality (e.g. caloric density). This result strongly suggests that the underlying mechanisms evolved in part as adaptations for efficient foraging. Together, these results demonstrate that human spatial cognition is content sensitive, domain specific and designed by natural selection to mesh with important regularities of the ancestral world.},

annote = {Whereas school ties, club memberships, tribal customs, and religious creeds are poten- tially vulnerable to exploitation, some markers, such as lan- guage and accent, are hard to fake and hard to hide: “hiding one's native accent in a foreign language is nearly impossible”


"Strong Reciprocity"

The benefit of this propensity is meted out at the group level. Where groups are sufficiently large as to render average genetic relatedness extremely low, it is argued that cooperation in such interactions cannot be explained in terms of inclusive fitness benefits (Bowles and Gintis 2004:18)

Lehmann et al. (2007) have shown, for example, that the evolution of strong reciprocity relies upon standard benefits to self and kin

Recently, several models in theoretical biology have inves-
tigated the logical plausibility of assortment among strangers based on observable, arbitrary traits—or “tags”—that signal cooperative potential.


Modeling tag-based cooperation
Three co-evolutionary parameters governing the evolution of co-operation via tag-based assortative strategies: (1) the discrim- inatory strategies governing behavior; (2) the reliability of the tags on which the behavior may be conditioned; and (3) the population structure that determines who interacts with whom

The success of cooperators in the face of such threats is explained in terms of the spatial dynamics of the model at the level of the region. Interactions are local (in other words, occurring among neighbors), and dispersal of offspring is limited. This allows successful agents and their offspring to rapidly form coherent regions. Whereas egoists receive no help from those in their region, discriminatory cooperators benefit from the help of those around them. The result is that a region of discriminators tends to expand at the expense of an adjacent region of egoists (Axelrod, Hammond,and Grafen 2004:1834)

the evolution of tag-contingent or similarity-based cooperation in a well-mixed population (i.e., no spatial struc- ture is assumed and everyone is equally likely to interact with everyone else; Antal et al 2009; Colman, Browning, and Pul- ford 2012; Ihara 2011)

In such scenarios, no two individuals would have exactly the same tag, but the conditional behavioral strategy would be triggered by sufficient phe- notypic similarity (Antal et al. 2009:8599; Colman, Browning, and Pulford 2012)

Mechanisms:

-Learning biases
The possibility that similarity can breed cooperation potentially helps to explain the origins of pervasive biases guiding human sociality (e.g., homophilous friendship prefer- ences) and cultural transmission (e.g., within-group imitative learning biases)

- Coalition psychology
An alternative and potentially competing ac- count postulates that the psychological propensity to imitate and selectively interact with individuals who share one's symbolic markers has been favored in selection because it allows individuals to learn and adopt the right norms of the cultural group and thereby reap the fitness rewards of social life (Richerson and Boyd 2005:212–213)

A coevolutionary helix of genetic and cultural selection for both norms and the psychological propensity to acquire the norms of one's group accounts for the proximate and ultimate causation underlying group-based trust, in-group favoritism, out-group dispreference and hos- tility, group marking, “tribal instincts,” and inclusion and exclusion mechanisms (e.g., Boyd and Richerson 2009; Chu- dek and Henrich 2011; McElreath, Boyd, and Richerson 2003; Richerson and Boyd 2005).

Henrich (2004) directly challenged the assumption commonly built into these models of an a priori bias in favor of tag-marked cooperators and against defectors.

The work of Riolo, Cohen, and Axelrod (2001), for example, demonstrated that co- operation could evolve if individuals with matching tags al- ways help each other. But, as Henrich questioned, why should this bias be assumed (2004:138)? Where are the inevitable pretenders and defectors?

The problem, according to Richerson and Boyd (2005:213), is that culturally transmitted symbols are easy to fake: “talk is cheap and so is hair dye” (although see Henrich and Henrich [2007:176] on the special properties of linguistic markers as reliable co- ordination guides)

Simulations have demonstrated that cooperation can recover as a new dominant cluster es- tablishes, generating a long-term “tidal” pattern (referred to as “beard chromodynamics”; Riolo, Cohen, and Axelrod 2001; Sigmund 2009; Sigmund and Nowak 2001; Traulsen and No- wak 2007). 

human traits that could potentially form a robust foundation for the assortment of cooperators, allowing tag-based cooperation to emerge?


What makes a reliable tag?
A reliable and evolutionarily viable tag makes a number of demands. It must be a property of the individual yet comparable across individuals, readily observable (by whichever sense), and hard to fake.

Tag inheritance should be low-cost; a cheap-to-acquire and hard-to-fake tag will sustain a more favorable cost-benefit balance sheet than an expensive-to- acquire and hard-to-fake tag

Plausible mechanisms include imperfect inheritance across generations, ontogenetic change, and cultural isolation and drift

Finally, if tags played a part in the emergence and main-
tenance of cooperation in large, regional networks, the candidate tag should be evolutionarily ancient and cross-culturally universal

several researchers across a range of disciplines
have claimed that linguistic cues inherent in speech accent, or patterns of intonation and phonology, harbor special po- tential as reliable tags for the orientation of social and cooperative preferences among strangers


Language: shibboleth 
Indeed, it has been argued that the evolutionary raison d'etre of language is to facilitate social cohesion via the transfer of such information (Dunbar 1996)

However language emerged, it harbors valuable socially
strategic signaling potential that can be realized irrespective of the semantic content of the message conveyed

Accent is one of the most fundamental and salient social identity cues that language affords (Fuertes, Pot- ere, and Ramirez 2002; Gluszek and Dovidio 2010)

Two peo- ple may say exactly the same thing, but, depending on their accent, they may be perceived, trusted, evaluated, and heeded differently (e.g., Giles 1973)

the rapidity with which people can extract this information from accent cues, and the readiness with which it is used in guiding behavior, testifies to the salience of accent in the human linguistic com- munication

the variability within every sphere around which a boundary might be drawn persists down to the singular individual; linguists use labels such as “dialect,” “sociolect,” and “idiolect” to capture this reality at the levels of culture, subculture, and individual.

linguistic variability is not randomly distributed. Idiolects are roughly nested within sociolects, dialects within languages, languages within lan- guage families, and so on.

The value of linguistic varieties as tags guiding cooperation depends on whether these varieties can be readily faked.Much speculation about the reliability of linguistic cues as honest signals is based on personal experience, anecdote, and assumption

Passing for a local beyond one's immediate accent area is notoriously difficult—whether attempting to speak a foreign language or native-language dialect. Certain features of one's habitual speech patterns can also be hard to hide, especially if distinctions (such as between l and r) are no longer consciously accessible (see below)

“Critical Period Hypothesis” (CPH) for second-language acquisition (Nikolov and Djigunovic 2006)

The central claim of the CPH is that natural language acquisition (which, according to certain accounts, relies on plasticity of procedural memory and implicit competence) is available to young children, but not older children and adults. The plasticity of the mechanisms underpinning natural lan- guage acquisition is said to decrease with age

Older learners must therefore compensate for the resulting decline of implicit competence by recruiting explicit mechanisms, such as de- clarative memory and metalinguistic knowledge (see Nikolov and Djigunovic 2006)

Even if it is demonstrated that adult learners of a foreign language can achieve native-like proficiency in grammar and pronunciation, what matters for the success of the tag is the cost of obtaining such proficiency. Prolonged and intensive immersion is known to have positive effects on language learning, including the elimination of the beginner's telltale foreign accent (as judged by native speakers). Yet, this merely supports the claim that linguistic cues are hard to fake, even if they are not impossible to fake under the right set of con- ditions

simply prohibitive for the stranger seeking to operate a swift hit-and-run strategy. If bearing the right tag is the condition for access to the benefits of cooperation, and the only way in which the tag can be acquired is by being born into the community or through later long-term integration, the non- native interloper faces an impossible task. What matters, then, for the honesty criterion is that achieving native-like profi- ciency in nonnative language is extremely difficult.

Clearly, humans' extremely fine-tuned vocal learning ca-
pacities allow for the transmission of extensive vocabularies. But was this the ultimate, evolutionary function of sophis- ticated capacities for vocal imitation?

An evolu- tionary arms race between group members and interlopers may have selected for sharper discrimination and increasingly complex “passwords,” leading to runaway selection for in- creased vocal learning and finer perceptual tuning (Fitch 2000: 264).

This intriguing proposal effectively inverts the by-product account—rather than accent hitching a ride with language, accent potentially emerges prior to language. The independent pressures that selected for increasingly sophisticated and sub- tle tag signaling would ultimately have permitted the vocal communication of complex semantic structures, not the other way around.},

Accumulated palaeoanthropological discoveries now document the Oldowan Complex as the dominant stone tool making culture between 2.6-1.4 Ma, the earlier part of this contemporaneous with pre-Homo hominins. The principal types of artefacts and other remains from 20 Early Stone Age (Oldowan and earliest Acheulean) localities in Africa and elsewhere are reviewed and described. To better understand the ancestral behavioural foundations of this early lithic culture, we examine a range of recent findings from primatology. In particular, we attempt to identify key shared characteristics of Homo and Pan that support inferences about the preparedness of our common ancestor for the innovation of stone tool culture. Findings of particular relevance include: (i) the discovery of an expanding repertoire of percussive and other tool use based on directed use of force among wild chimpanzees, implicating capacities that include significant innovatory potential and appreciation of relevant causal factors; (ii) evidence of material cultural diversity among wild chimpanzees, indicating a readiness to acquire and transmit tool use innovations; and (iii) experimental studies of social learning in chimpanzees and bonobos that now encompass the acquisition of nut cracking through observation of skilled use of hammers and anvils by conspecifics, the diffusion within and between groups of alternative styles of tool use, and the adoption of free-hand stone-to-stone percussion to create useful flakes for cutting to gain access to food resources. We use the distributions of the inferred cultural traits in the wild to assess how diffusion relates to geographic distances, and find that shared traits drop by 50{\%} from the approximately eight characteristic of close neighbours over a distance of approximately 700 km. This pattern is used to explore the implications of analogous processes operating in relation to Early Stone Age sites.},

annote = {Extra-kin cooperation among humans is an evolutionary puzzle because 
cooperative behavior must always be grounded in the individual and in- clusive fitness of the cooperator.

ALTRUISM is therefore the most difficult problem to understand in cooperation
- Are biological adaptations for altruism necessary to faciliate altruism in (large) human groups?

the Big Mistake Hypothesis (e.g., Burnham and Johnson 2005):
altruism evolved when humans lived in small groups, comprised mostly of kin: In this setting, altruistic acts would either 
(a) benefit kin, and so evolve due to kin selection, or else 
(b) benefit the altruist by enhancing in some way her chances for reciprocity, which is especially critical in small groups in which reputational assessment among familiar interactants is constant.

In the modern world, even in the midst of strangers or even when not being observed by others at all, humans nevertheless have some tendency toward altruism (and antipathy toward cheat- ers) because the proximate mechanism operates as if the ancient, small-group conditions still held.


the Cultural Group Selection Hy-pothesis (e.g., Henrich and Henrich 2007; Richerson and Boyd 2005) focuses on a later stage in human evolution characterized by larger social groups:
- social groups with more altruists will, for various reasons, outcompete other groups.
- the main transmission across generations takes place not genetically but culturally. For other reasons, modern humans are built to imitate others (e.g., successful others or the majority), and so if a group has al- truists, others will often imitate them, and that will lead to group success.
- As groups become larger in scale, those that create social norms and institutions that better promote al- truism will again thrive relative to others.

Our starting point is not cooperation as altruistic helping, but rather cooperation as mutualistic collaboration

Interdependence Hypothesis:
humans created lifeways in which collaborating with others was necessary for survival and procreation (and cheating was controlled by partner choice)


Moreover, interdependent collaboration also helps to explain humans' unique forms of cognition and social organization, since it is collaboration, not altruism, that creates the many coordination problems that arise as individuals attempt to put their heads together in acts of shared intentionality to create and maintain the complex technologies, symbol systems, and cul- tural institutions of modern human societies.

First,
small-scale collaboration involving cognitively complex coordination problems took place in collaborative foraging. 

Although humans' 
- more stable reproductive bonds (Chapais 2008) and 
- cooperative breeding (Hrdy 2009) 
clearly played an important role in establishing the motivational and emotional foundations, 

the cognitive dimension of human cooperation evolved in contexts in which, in order to acquire food, individuals had to create together various coordination strategies (often involving technologies), which they then could communicate cooperatively to others within and across generations (Sterelny 2012).

Second, 
group-level collaboration followed as the entire social group needed to work together interdependently in order to compete with other social groups, leading to such things as 
group-created conventions, 
norms, and 
institutions

[This step was undoubtedly followed by something like cultural group selection, but cultural group selection explains why the particular social norms and institutions of particular cultural groups have prevailed, and this assumes species-universal skills and motivations—such as those we will posit—for creating social norms and institutions in the first place]

- young children in fact (and possibly of logical necessity) learn to collaborate with other individuals in concrete situations before they construct more abstract group-level phenomena such as social norms and institutions.

First Step: Obligate Collaborative Foraging

The central challenge of social life is often presented as a Prisoner's Dilemma in which the individual must choose be- tween its own well-being and that of the group
But the Pris- oner's Dilemma arises only in very special circumstances, and it does indeed tend to block cooperation

STAG HUNT
A better model for real-life cooperation is the Stag Hunt (Skyrms 2004):

(i) individuals must col- laborate with others to benefit, 
(ii) the benefits of the collab- oration are greater than those of any solo alternatives, and 
(iii) all solo alternatives must be forsaken (risked) in order to collaborate.

In stark contrast, nonhuman great apes—and so, by hypoth- esis, the last common ancestor—were and are almost exclu- sively individual foragers. Chimpanzees and bonobos may search for food in small social groups, but when they find food, each individual procures and consumes it on its own (with sharing only under special circumstances). They do not extract or otherwise obtain food by working collaboratively with others, nor do they, as humans do, bring food back to some central location to provision others.

Problems of the stag-hunt:
a) Sharing the spoils: individuals had to find some way to
divide the spoils at the end of the collaboration such that there was no destructive fighting and such that everyone was incentivized for future stag hunting. 
b) Coordination: individuals had to find some way to make
a confidence-inspiring “group decision” about whether to go for the stag, given that each of them had to relinquish their “hare in the hand” to do so. 
c) Temptations to free ride: individuals had to solve the
problem that if there were more people present than were needed to capture the stag (but all could eat), then everyone had an incentive to let the others do the hard and risky work of stag killing—resulting in inaction from everyone.

Sharing the spoils:
Chimpanzees' predominant solution to food competition in general, namely, dominance, tends to destabilize collaborative foraging over time.

Contemporary hunter-gatherers routinely share the spoils of their collabo- rative foraging on the scene, without harassment, and large packets of food are almost always brought back to some cen- tral location and shared with nonparticipants (Gurven 2004).

here are no human groups who behave like other great apes in simply scrambling for food competitively 

In experiments, humans are much more generous with food than are chimpanzees, and they expect their conspecifics to be more generous (even fair) as well.

Thus, in economic games, humans routinely take into account the needs and desires of others, whereas this is not the case for chimpanzees. For example, humans routinely give a significant portion of some windfall resource to an unknown individual in dictator games, whereas no one has ever performed a dictator game with chimpanzees because the outcome—that they would ac- tively give none of their windfall to others—is already known.

In ultimatum games, humans typically expect their playing partner to expect a reasonable offer (with “reasonable” de- pending on general cultural norms; Henrich et al. 2006), whereas chimpanzees in the ultimatum game seem not to take into account the needs or expectations of their playing partner at all (Jensen, Call, and Tomasello 2007a).

But it is not until the second step of our account (in the
section “Second Step: Group-Mindedness”) that we include such things as group-wide social norms of fairness and the like, and so for now, a better representative of the human species would be children—before they have become fully normative beings.

Brownell, Svetlova, and Nichols (2009) found that even 2-year-old children—well before they self- govern through social norms—chose to pull food to them- selves more often when that also meant food for their companion.

SCAVENGING:
Thus, as the genus Homo was emerging some 2 million years ago, a global cooling and drying trend created an expansion of open environments and a radiation in terrestrial monkeys, who would have competed with Homo for many plant foods.

Individuals would be especially well suited for scavenging
if they were tolerant of conspecifics cofeeding on a carcass with them.

when experimenters pair together chimpanzee individuals who are especially tolerant with one another in the context of food (established by an independent food tolerance test), they are much more likely to collaborate successfully and share the spoils at the end than are intolerant partners (Melis, Hare, and Tomasello 2006b)

It is also likely that at some point, individuals who at- tempted to hog all of the food at a scavenged carcass would be actively repelled by others and perhaps shunned in other ways as well—a first step toward what Boehm (2001) calls “counter-dominance.”

in the context of scavenging, the individuals who did best were those who (1) were tolerant of others peacefully cofeeding on the same carcass and (2) did not attempt to hog the spoils and so be socially selected against by others for selfish behavior

Coordination:
Coordination in Chimpanzee group hunting (of monkeys) is an emergent property generated by individual decision making not aimed at that coordination. Chimpanzees are interested in their own acquisition of food,but they understood when they needed a partner for success

when chimpanzees were given the choice to obtain food by collaborating with a partner or acting alone, they most often chose to act alone, whereas human children most often chose to collaborate.

Chimpanzees do not actively communicate about the collaboration 

In the wild, chimpanzees do vocalize their excitement at various points throughout the hunt. But chimpanzee vocalizations are mostly hardwired to particular stimulus and motivational states

what is being ex-pressed is general excitement (with the same vocalizations used when excited about other things) and not anything about the content of what is happening or what the vocalizer wants to happen.

Humans, in contrast, coordinate and communicate about their decision making in such situations to form a joint goal.

Know- ing together means engaging in some form of recursive mind reading (we each know that the other knows, etc.), which is the basic cognitive ability that enables humans to engage in all forms of joint and collective intentionality (Tomasello 2008, 2009) joint attention, common conceptual ground, and all “public” knowledge and activities. And once they have formed a joint goal, humans are committed to it.

Thus, when their collaborative partner stops interacting with them, even 18-month-old infants expect her to be committed, and so they attempt in various ways to reengage her—as opposed to human-raised chimpanzees, who do not (War- neken, Chen, and Tomasello 2006).

when they are forced to switch roles in a collaborative activity, young children already know what to do from having observed their partner earlier from the “other side” of the collaboration—

humans, but not chim- panzees, comprehend joint activities and their different roles from a bird's-eye view in which all roles are interchangeable, that is, conceptualized in an agent-neutral manner in a single representational format.

This conceptual organization enables everything from bidirectional linguistic conventions to social institutions with their publicly created joint goals and indi- vidual roles that can in principle be filled by anyone

How did early humans move from a chimpanzee mode of initiating and coordinating Stag Hunt activities—based either on a leader-follower strategy or on a kind of naive optimism about the other's actions—to the modern human mode in which individuals coordinate their decision making through some kind of implicit or explicit communication?

With humans,
the hypothesis is that at some point their scavenging turned into active collaborative hunting and gathering (perhaps with the emergence of Homo heidelbergensis some 800 kya (thou- sand years ago; Dubreuil 2010), with evidence for bringing large prey back to a home base from at least 400–200 kya (Stiner, Barkai, and Gopher 2009).

decision making became more challenging, in particular when the risk became such that just optimistically leaving the hare in hand (as chimpanzees seem- ingly do) was no longer an effective strategy.

social selection based on reputation almost certainly played a role in all of this as well—but in this case, not for individuals who were tolerant around food and fair at sharing the spoils but rather for competent coordinators and communicators who would increase the likelihood of success.

Clearly, humans' skills of coordination and communication increased continuously af- ter their initial emergence—from pointing and pantomiming to conventional languages—and the hypothesis is simply that better coordinators and communicators were chosen as col- laborative partners more often

In general, as humans went from more passive scavenging to more active collaborative foraging, they were faced with ever more challenging coor- dination situations and decisions, and this provided the selective context for the evolution of ever greater skills of co- ordination and communication

Temptations to Free Ride:

In Stag Hunt situations with no excess of labor available (all individuals present are needed for success), free riding is not possible: if I do not participate, then I (and everyone else) get nothing.

Interestingly, contemporary children seemto have virtually no interest in free riding, as participating in collaborations seems to be rewarding in itself (Grafenhain et al. 2009).

So what do humans do about free riders? 
The answer is, of course, social selection by means of reputation. Humans have evolved extremely sensitive cheater-detection mecha- nisms of a type never observed in chimpanzees or other great apes (no studies have investigated apes' partner choice with respect to free riders)—which lead them not only to shun free riders but sometimes even to punish them (Cosmides 1989).

Many experiments clearly demonstrate that humans' concern for their own reputation is an important incentive for coopera- tion in many situations in which free riding would otherwise be beneficial (Milinski, Semmann, and Krambeck 2002)

Punishment:
Humans sometimes even mete out third-party punishment against those harming others (when they them- selves are not being harmed), whereas chimpanzees—even though they retaliate against those who harm them directly (Jensen, Call, and Tomasello 2007b)—do not (Riedl et al. 2012).

When humans are punishing a noncooperator, they
typically experience resentment or moral anger, which goes beyond normal anger because it seems justified

good collaborators to find one another is thus not reputation for altruism or anything else external, but simply reputation for being a good collaborator—which is, with actual partners and direct observers, impossible to fake.


Interdependence and Altruistic Helping
Mutu- alistic collaboration thus provides a safe context within which basic tendencies to help others could evolve (see Silk 2009)

It is thus not surprising that when Ache foragers are hunting, they do such things for their partners as give them weapons, clear trails for them, carry their child, repair their weapon, instruct them in best techniques, and so on (Hill 2002)

In- terestingly, young children, but not chimpanzees, help others more readily in the context of collaborative activities than outside of such activities (Greenberg et al. 2010; Hamann, Warneken, and Tomasello 2012)

sB {\textgreater} C
If I can acquire food only with the help of a partner, then when potential partners are in trouble, I should help them—even outside of any collab- orative activity. The logic is exactly the same as Hamilton's equation for kin, as worked out by Roberts (2005) in his Stakeholder model: I should sacrifice to help potential part- ners when sB {\textgreater} C

B represents ultimate re- productive benefits, and these must exceed costs, C, when the benefits are conditioned by the stake, s, I have in the particular partner (analogous to Hamilton's coefficient of relatedness).

Clutton-Brock (2002) proposes a generalized version of this mechanism called group augmentation: if my pros- perity depends on my social group (for defense against pred- ators, etc.), then it is in my interest to keep them alive and prosperous as well.




The process is, then, a formof social selection: I help others who do things that benefit me (more than my help costs me)

if I have a stake in an alarm caller and so help her, then what I am socially selecting for is better alarm callers (who have keen perception, loud vocalizations, etc.)

But when the target domain is collaboration, then what is being socially selected for is good collaborators—who are tolerant of others in cofeeding situations, skillful at coordination and communication, have a tendency to shun or punish free rid- ers, help their partners, and so on.

{\^{}} i.e. TECHNICAL and SOCIAL COMPETENCE

The point is not that interdependence as described by the Stake-holder model solves the problem of altruism but that, using the same logic as kin selection, it changes the math because my selfish benefits depend on the well-being of selected others.

Obligate collaborative foraging thus creates a logic of interdependence, which leads to the selective helping of those who will be needed as collaborative partners in the future

It is noteworthy that whereas almost all other accounts of the evolution of human altruism rest on one or another form of reciprocity, reciprocity cannot explain uncontingent acts of altruistic helping.

The current account, in contrast, does not depend on reciprocity because I am repaid for my altruistic acts not by reciprocated altruistic acts from others, but rather by their later mutualistic collaboration, which costs them nothing (actually benefits them).

Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated experimentally that humans will actually com- pete with one another to be more altruistic so that observers will later choose them to engage in a mutualistic collaboration (Sylwester and Roberts 2010).

Summary:
when chimpanzees do hunt in small groups for monkeys, they do this with cognitive and moti- vational mechanisms not specifically evolved for the task, that is, they somehow manage to be successful quite often in spite of their tendencies toward dominance in solving food disputes.

In contrast, humans, as already evident in young children, have evolved a suite of cognitive and motivationalmech- anisms for sharing food cooperatively, coordinating and communicating toward joint goals with complementary roles, and engaging in various kinds of reputation-based social se- lection (including a concern for self-reputation as a coop- erator)—what we have called skills and motivations for joint intentionality.


Our evolutionary story so far has been highly selective. As noted at the outset, we have backgrounded the important role of kinship, as humans evolved more stable reproductive bonds (resulting in an increase in male tolerance), which obviously played an important role in the attitudes of individuals toward one another in small groups (Chapais 2008)

Further in this context, humans also became cooperative breeders, regularly providing child care for offspring who were not their own, and this clearly would have affected emotions andmotivations for collaboration and altruism as well (Hrdy 2009).

Most likely, both of these processes played a key role in the earliest stages of the story we are telling here, as humans were becoming more tolerant with one another around food

And so a big first step in the evolution of uniquely human cooperation is one in which the usual suspects—kin selection, sexual selection, direct reciprocity, and indirect reciprocity— play only minor roles. 

The heroes of our story are:
(1) mutualistic collaboration and the logic of interdependence (STAG HUNT not Prisoner's Dillemma), and 
(2) social selection based on reputation as a good collaborator. Based on social and technical competence},

Recent research suggests considerable cross-cultural differences in cognitive strategies, including relational thinking, a domain where infant research is impossible because of lack of cognitive maturation. Here, we apply the same paradigm across children and adults of different cultures and across all nonhuman great ape genera. We find that both child and adult spatial cognition systematically varies with language and culture but that, nevertheless, there is a clear inherited bias for one spatial strategy in the great apes. It is reasonable to conclude, we argue, that language and culture mask the native tendencies in our species. This cladistic approach suggests that the correct perspective on human cognition is neither nativist uniformitarian nor "blank slate" but recognizes the powerful impact that language and culture can have on our shared primate cognitive biases.},

The developing brain is very different. It starts out highly interconnected across regions and is neither localized nor specialized at birth, allowing interaction with the environment to play an important role in gene expression and the ultimate cognitive phenotype.

abstract = {The existence of interindividual differences in personality traits poses a challenge to evolutionary thinking. Although research on the ultimate consequences of personality differences in nonhuman animals has recently undergone a surge of interest, our understanding of whether and how personality influences reproductive decisions in humans has remained limited and informed primarily by modern societies with low mortality-fertility schedules. Taking an evolutionary approach, we use data from a contemporary polygynous high-fertility human population living in rural Senegal to investigate whether personality dimensions are associated with key life-history traits in humans, i.e., quantity and quality of offspring. We show that personality dimensions predict reproductive success differently in men and women in such societies and, in women, are associated with a trade-off between offspring quantity and quality. In women, neuroticism positively predicts the number of children, both between and within polygynous families. Furthermore, within the low social class, offspring quality (i.e., child nutritional status) decreases with a woman's neuroticism, indicating a reproductive trade-off between offspring quantity and quality. Consistent with this, maximal fitness is achieved by women at an intermediate neuroticism level. In men, extraversion was found to be a strong predictor of high social class and polygyny, with extraverted men producing more offspring than their introverted counterparts. These results have implications for the consideration of alternative adaptive hypotheses in the current debate on the maintenance of personality differences and the role of individual factors in fertility patterns in contemporary humans.},

abstract = {The anthropological record indicates that approximately 85 per cent of human societies have permitted men to have more than one wife (polygynous marriage), and both empirical and evolutionary considerations suggest that large absolute differences in wealth should favour more polygynous marriages. Yet, monogamous marriage has spread across Europe, and more recently across the globe, even as absolute wealth differences have expanded. Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis that the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been favoured by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effects-promoting success in inter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of unmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. By assuaging the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy decreases (i) the spousal age gap, (ii) fertility, and (iii) gender inequality. By shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child investment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative monogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide. These predictions are tested using converging lines of evidence from across the human sciences.},

abstract = {Cumulative cultural evolution has been suggested to account for key cognitive and behavioral attributes that distinguish modern humans from their anatomically similar ancestors, but researchers have yet to establish which cognitive mechanisms are responsible for this kind of learning and whether they are unique to humans. Here, we show that human participants' cumulative learning is not always reliant on sources of social information commonly assumed to be essential. Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching. Each condition was independently sufficient for participants to show cumulative learning. Because emulative learning can elicit cumulative culture on this task, we conclude that accounts of the unusual complexity of human culture in terms of species-unique learning mechanisms do not currently provide complete explanations and that other factors may be involved.},

abstract = {Human reproductive behaviour is marked by exceptional variation at the population and individual level. Human behavioural ecologists propose adaptive hypotheses to explain this variation as shifting phenotypic optima in relation to local socioecological niches. Here we review evidence that variation in fertility (offspring number), in both traditional and modern industrialized populations, represents optimization of the life-history trade-off between reproductive rate and parental investment. While a reliance on correlational methods suggests the true costs of sibling resource competition are often poorly estimated, a range of anthropological and demographic studies confirm that parents balance family size against offspring success. Evidence of optimization is less forthcoming. Declines in fertility associated with modernization are particularly difficult to reconcile with adaptive models, because fertility limitation fails to enhance offspring reproductive success. Yet, considering alternative measures, we show that modern low fertility confers many advantages on offspring, which are probably transmitted to future generations. Evidence from populations that have undergone or initiated demographic transition indicate that these rewards to fertility limitation fall selectively on relatively wealthy individuals. The adaptive significance of modern reproductive behaviour remains difficult to evaluate, but may be best understood in response to rising investment costs of rearing socially and economically competitive offspring.},

abstract = {Humans are an exceptionally cooperative species, but there is substantial variation in the extent of cooperation across societies. Understanding the sources of this variability may provide insights about the forces that sustain cooperation. We examined the ontogeny of prosocial behavior by studying 326 children 3–14 y of age and 120 adults from six societies (age distributions varied across societies). These six societies span a wide range of extant human variation in culture, geography, and subsistence strategies, including foragers, herders, horticulturalists, and urban dwellers across the Americas, Oceania, and Africa. When delivering benefits to others was personally costly, rates of prosocial behavior dropped across all six societies as children approached middle childhood and then rates of prosociality diverged as children tracked toward the behavior of adults in their own societies. When prosocial acts did not require personal sacrifice, prosocial responses increased steadily as children matured with little variation in behavior across societies. Our results are consistent with theories emphasizing the importance of acquired cultural norms in shaping costly forms of cooperation and creating cross-cultural diversity.},

This brain region hosts a system of executive processes extending from premotor to the most anterior prefrontal regions that governs the temporal organization of behavior. Little is known, however, about the prefrontal executive system involved in the hierarchical organization of behavior. Here, we show using magnetic resonance imaging in humans that the posterior portion of the prefrontal cortex, including Broca's area and its homolog in the right hemisphere, contains a system of executive processes that control start and end states and the nesting of functional segments that combine in hierarchically organized action plans. Our results indicate that Broca's area and its right homolog process hierarchically structured behaviors regardless of their temporal organization, suggesting a fundamental segregation between prefrontal executive systems involved in the hierarchical and temporal organization of goal-directed behaviors.},

abstract = {This study explored whether the tendency of chimpanzees and children to use emulation or imitation to solve a tool-using task was a response to the availability of causal information. Young wild-born chimpanzees from an African sanctuary and 3- to 4-year-old children observed a human demonstrator use a tool to retrieve a reward from a puzzle-box. The demonstration involved both causally relevant and irrelevant actions, and the box was presented in each of two conditions: opaque and clear. In the opaque condition, causal information about the effect of the tool inside the box was not available, and hence it was impossible to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant parts of the demonstration. However, in the clear condition causal information was available, and subjects could potentially determine which actions were necessary. When chimpanzees were presented with the opaque box, they reproduced both the relevant and irrelevant actions, thus imitating the overall structure of the task. When the box was presented in the clear condition they instead ignored the irrelevant actions in favour of a more efficient, emulative technique. These results suggest that emulation is the favoured strategy of chimpanzees when sufficient causal information is available. However, if such information is not available, chimpanzees are prone to employ a more comprehensive copy of an observed action. In contrast to the chimpanzees, children employed imitation to solve the task in both conditions, at the expense of efficiency. We suggest that the difference in performance of chimpanzees and children may be due to a greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions, perhaps combined with a differential focus on the results, actions and goals of the demonstrator.},

The first is to assess, in the face of accruing reports on the ingenuity of great ape tool use, whether and in what sense human tool use still evidences unique, higher cognitive ability. To that effect, I offer a systematic comparison between humans and nonhuman primates with respect to nine cognitive capacities deemed crucial to tool use: enhanced hand-eye coordination, body schema plasticity, causal reasoning, function representation, executive control, social learning, teaching, social intelligence, and language. Since striking differences between humans and great apes stand firm in eight out of nine of these domains, I conclude that human tool use still marks a major cognitive discontinuity between us and our closest relatives. As a second goal of the paper, I address the evolution of human technologies. In particular, I show how the cognitive traits reviewed help to explain why technological accumulation evolved so markedly in humans, and so modestly in apes.},

abstract = {Theories of music origins and the role of musical emotions in the mind are reviewed. Most existing theories contradict each other, and cannot explain mechanisms or roles of musical emotions in workings of the mind, nor evolutionary reasons for music origins. Music seems to be an enigma. Nevertheless, a synthesis of cognitive science and mathematical models of the mind has been proposed describing a fundamental role of music in the functioning and evolution of the mind, consciousness, and cultures. The review considers ancient theories of music as well as contemporary theories advanced by leading authors in this field. It addresses one hypothesis that promises to unify the field and proposes a theory of musical origin based on a fundamental role of music in cognition and evolution of consciousness and culture. We consider a split in the vocalizations of proto-humans into two types: one less emotional and more concretely-semantic, evolving into language, and the other preserving emotional connections along with semantic ambiguity, evolving into music. The proposed hypothesis departs from other theories in considering specific mechanisms of the mind-brain, which required the evolution of music parallel with the evolution of cultures and languages. Arguments are reviewed that the evolution of language toward becoming the semantically powerful tool of today required emancipation from emotional encumbrances. The opposite, no less powerful mechanisms required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated and refined emotionality. The need for refined music in the process of cultural evolution is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of the mind. This is why today's human mind and cultures cannot exist without today's music. The reviewed hypothesis gives a basis for future analysis of why different evolutionary paths of languages were paralleled by different evolutionary paths of music. Approaches toward experimental verification of this hypothesis in psychological and neuroimaging research are reviewed.},

Previously, people have been shown to represent time spatially from left to right or right to left, or from front to back or back to front. All of these representations are with respect to the body. Pormpuraawans instead arrange time according to cardinal directions: east to west. That is, time flows from left to right when one is facing south, from right to left when one is facing north, toward the body when one is facing east, and away from the body when one is facing west. These findings reveal a qualitatively different set of representations of time, with time organized in a coordinate frame that is independent from others reported previously. The results demonstrate that conceptions of even such fundamental domains as time can differ dramatically across cultures.},

abstract = {The identification of signals of very recent positive selection provides information about the adaptation of modern humans to local conditions. We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest approximately 250 signals of recent selection in each population.},

annote = {The Rice Theory of Culture

In irrigation networks, one family's water use can affect their neighbors, so rice farmers have to coordinate their water use. 

Irrigation networks also require many hours each year to build, dredge, and drain—a burden that often falls on villages, not isolated individuals.

Agricultural anthropologists vis- iting premodern China observed the number of hours farmers worked and found that growing paddy rice required at least twice the number of hours as wheat (9).

In economic terms, paddy rice makes cooperation more valuable.},

We propose that a creative personality and a creative mindset promote individuals' ability to justify their behavior, which, in turn, leads to unethical behavior. In 5 studies, we show that participants with creative personalities tended to cheat more than less creative individuals and that dispositional creativity is a better predictor of unethical behavior than intelligence (Experiment 1). In addition, we find that participants who were primed to think creatively were more likely to behave dishonestly than those in a control condition (Experiment 2) and that greater ability to justify their dishonest behavior explained the link between creativity and increased dishonesty (Experiments 3 and 4). Finally, we demonstrate that dispositional creativity moderates the influence of temporarily priming creativity on dishonest behavior (Experiment 5). The results provide evidence for an association between creativity and dishonesty, thus highlighting a dark side of creativity.},

Before the task, they were exposed to moral rules (i.e., an honor code). Those who cheated were more likely to forget the moral rules after behaving dishonestly, even though they were equally likely to remember morally irrelevant information (Experiment 1). Furthermore, people showed moral forgetting only after cheating could be enacted but not before cheating (Experiment 2), despite monetary incentives to recall the rules accurately (Experiment 3). Finally, moral forgetting appears to result from decreased access to moral rules after cheating (Experiment 4).},

We describe general techniques that apply to a variety of types of research and experiments across disciplines. We begin by discussing some of the advantages of doing experiments on Mechanical Turk, such as easy access to a large, stable, and diverse subject pool, the low cost of doing experiments, and faster iteration between developing theory and executing experiments. While other methods of conducting behavioral research may be comparable to or even better than Mechanical Turk on one or more of the axes outlined above, we will show that when taken as a whole Mechanical Turk can be a useful tool for many researchers. We will discuss how the behavior of workers compares with that of experts and laboratory subjects. Then we will illustrate the mechanics of putting a task on Mechanical Turk, including recruiting subjects, executing the task, and reviewing the work that was submitted. We also provide solutions to common problems that a researcher might face when executing their research on this platform, including techniques for conducting synchronous experiments, methods for ensuring high-quality work, how to keep data private, and how to maintain code security.},

Interestingly, some symptoms of OT are related to beta-endorphin (beta-end(1-31)) effects. Some of its effects, such as analgesia, increasing lactate tolerance, and exercise-induced euphoria, are important for training. These effects can be reverted by detraining or OT, which may cause decrease in performance, reduced load tolerance, and depression. The main stimulus for beta-end(1-31) secretion is to exercise because its secretion is volume/intensity dependent for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Excess training, however, may reduce beta-end(1-31) concentrations, thus altering its beneficial effects. Therefore, beta-end(1-31) could be used as an additional OT marker, mainly because its effects are strongly related to OT symptoms.},

Exercise of sufficient intensity and duration has been demonstrated to increase circulating beta-endorphin levels. Previous reviews have presented the background of opioids and exercise and discussed the changes in beta-endorphin levels in response to aerobic and anaerobic exercise. The present review is to update the response of beta-endorphin to exercise. This review suggests that exercise-induced beta-endorphin alterations are related to type of exercise and special populations tested, and may differ in individuals with health problems. Additionally, some of the possible mechanisms which may induce beta-endorphin changes in the circulation include analgesia, lactate or base excess, and metabolic factors. Based on the type of exercise, different mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of beta-endorphin release during exercise.},

abstract = {When an endogenous morphine, beta-endorphin was discovered ten years ago, the fact that this morphine is present in the brain and many other tissues suggested to neurobiologists that these peptide opiates play a role which goes beyond that of a simple modulator of the perception of pain. beta-endorphin is a neurohormone which is secreted by the pituitary gland and reaches all tissues present in the body by diffusion. Many laboratories have investigated variations in serum levels of beta-endorphin under widely varying physiological or pathological conditions. Many references to these studies in the literature have thus demonstrated that beta-endorphins play a role in certain behavioural patterns (stress, alcoholism), in obesity, diabetes and psychiatric diseases. In fact, the activity of beta-endorphins would appear to have an interesting role to play and are a promising feature in the treatment of cerebral aging; in this field, beta-endorphins act not only as neuroregulators of other neurotransmitting substances but also, via calcium channels, exert an effect on the walls of cerebral arterioles. In situ, the role of beta-endorphins at the ionic channel level has been studied using the patch-clamp technique. In 1991, E Neher and B Sakmann received the Nobel Medicine and Physiology Prize for this work. beta-endorphin, which may be the "missing link" between the neuron and the wall of the arteriole, must be considered as being a fundamental neurotransmitter in the same way as well-known substances such as noradrenaline, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine and the GABAergic system are also neurotransmitters.},

abstract = {In the present article, three scales developed by Borg are compared on bicycle ergometer work. In the first study, comparing the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Category scales with Ratio properties (CR10) scales, 40 healthy subjects (12 men and eight women for each scale) with a mean age of about 30 years (SD approximately 6) participated. A work-test protocol with step-wise increase of work loads every minute was used (20 W increase for men and 15 W for women). Ratings and heart rates (HRs) were recorded every minute and blood lactates every third minute. Data obtained with the RPE scale were described with linear regressions, with individual correlations of about 0.98. Data obtained with the CR10 scale could also be described by linear regressions, but when described by power functions gave exponents of about 1.2 (SD approximately 0.4) (with one additional constant included in the power function). This was significantly lower than the exponent of between 1.5 and 1.9 that has previously been observed. Mean individual correlations were 0.98. Blood lactate concentration grew with monotonously increasing functions that could be described by power functions with a mean exponent of about 2.6 (SD approximately 0.6) (with two additional constants included in the power functions). In the second study, where also the more recently developed Borg CR100 scale (centiMax) was included, 24 healthy subjects (12 men and 12 women) with a mean age of about 29 years (SD approximately 3) participated in a work test with a step-wise increase of work loads (25 W) every third minute. Ratings and HRs were recorded. RPE values were described by linear regressions with individual correlations of about 0.97. Data from the two CR scales were described by power functions with mean exponents of about 1.4 (SD approximately 0.5) (with a-values in the power functions). Mean individual correlations were about 0.98. In both studies, a tendency for a deviation from linearity between RPE values and HRs was observed. The obtained deviations from what has previously been obtained for work of longer duration (4-6 min) points to a need for standardization of work-test protocols and to the advantage of using CR scales.},

abstract = {Patients with chronic pain frequently report that changes in the weather influence their pain. This study investigated differences in the perceived influence of weather on pain among 558 chronic pain patients living in 4 cities (San Diego, California; Nashville, Tennessee; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Boston, Massachusetts) in the United States. Local climatologic data for each city were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. All patients completed a weather questionnaire, and the information they provided was compared with demographic and weather variables. The majority of all patients believed that changes in the weather affected their pain. Pain patients who were younger and who had arthritis reported the most sensitivity to changes in weather. Weather sensitivity was unrelated to all other demographic variables and to geographic region. Cold and damp conditions were considered to influence pain the most. However, the perceived effect of weather on pain was not found to be related to regional climate. Thus, the belief that pain is worsened by living in a colder climate was not supported. An equilibrium theory of weather changes and pain is discussed. Further investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms involved in the effects of weather changes on pain.},

abstract = {The effect of diversity in individual prediscussion preferences on group decision quality was examined in an experiment in which 135 three-person groups worked on a personnel selection case with 4 alternatives. The information distribution among group members constituted a hidden profile (i.e., the correct solution was not identifiable on the basis of the members' individual information and could be detected only by pooling and integrating the members' unique information). Whereas groups with homogeneous suboptimal prediscussion preferences (no dissent) hardly ever solved the hidden profile, solution rates were significantly higher in groups with prediscussion dissent, even if none of these individual prediscussion preferences were correct. If dissent came from a proponent of the correct solution, solution rates were even higher than in dissent groups without such a proponent. The magnitude of dissent (i.e., minority dissent or full diversity of individual preferences) did not affect decision quality. The beneficial effect of dissent on group decision quality was mediated primarily by greater discussion intensity and to some extent also by less discussion bias in dissent groups.},

abstract = {The "hot hand" belief in sports refers to the conviction that a player has a higher chance of making a shot after two or three successful shots than after two or three misses (resulting in "streaks"). This belief is usually considered a cognitive fallacy, although it has been conjectured that in basketball the defense will attack a "hot" player and prevent streaks from occurring. To address this argument, we provide the first study on the hot hand in volleyball, where the net limits direct defensive counterstrategies, meaning that streaks can more likely emerge if a player is hot. We first establish that athletes believe in the hot hand in volleyball (Study 1A). Analyzing the top 26 first-division players, we then show that streaks do exist for half of the players (Study 1B). Coaches can detect players' performance variability and use it to make strategic decisions (Study 2A). Playmakers are also sensitive to streaks and rely on them when deciding to whom to allocate the ball (Study 2B). We conclude that for volleyball the hot hand exists, coaches and playmakers are able to detect it, and playmakers tend to use it "adaptively," which results in more hits for a team.},

abstract = {and analyzed reasoning by asking: what are the reasoner's goals? This emphasizes the adaptiveness of behavior rather than whether a belief is normative. Belief in the "hot hand" in basketball suggests that players experiencing streaks should be given more shots, but this has been seen as a fallacy due to failure to find dependencies between players' shots. Based on their findings, I demonstrate by Markov modeling and simulation that streaks are valid allocation cues for deciding who to give shots to, because this behavior achieves the team goal of scoring more. Empirically I show that this adaptive heuristic is supported by the fallacious belief in dependency, more so as skill level increases. I extend the theoretical analysis to identify general conditions under which following streaks should be beneficial. Overall, this approach illustrates the advantages of analyzing reasoning in terms of adaptiveness.},

These studies reveal an array of so-called cognitive biases and puzzling features of behaviour that seem irrational in the specific situation presented to the decision-maker. Here we review an emerging body of work that highlights spatiotemporal heterogeneity and autocorrelation as key properties of most real-world environments that may help us understand why these biases evolved. Ecologically rational decision rules adapted to such environments can lead to apparently maladaptive behaviour in artificial experimental settings. We encourage researchers to consider environments with greater complexity to understand better how evolution has shaped our cognitive systems.},

abstract = {When two or more individuals intend to achieve a joint outcome, they often need to time their own actions carefully with respect to those of their coactors. Online perceptual feedback supports coordination by allowing coactors to entrain with and predict each other's actions. However, joint actions are still possible when no or little online feedback is available. The current study investigated the interplay between higher-level planning processes and motor simulation in a joint action task where online feedback was not available. Pairs of participants performed forward jumps (hops) next to each other with the instruction to land at the same time. They could neither see nor hear each other, but were informed about their own and the partner's jumping distance beforehand. The analysis of basic movement parameters showed that participants adjusted the temporal and spatial properties of the movement preparation and execution phase of their jumps to the specific difference in distance between themselves and their partner. However, this adaptation was made exclusively by the person with the shorter distance to jump, indicating a distribution of coactors' efforts based on task characteristics. A comparison with an individual bipedal coordination condition suggests that joint coordination might rely on similar principles as interlimb coordination. These findings are interpreted within a framework of motor simulation.},

abstract = {Modern evolutionary psychology is demonstrating, once again, that an uncritical enthusiasm for the gene's-eye point of view can easily lead to conceptual excesses that go far beyond the available evidence. Seven major flaws in the evolutionary psychology agenda are outlined. With its enthusiasm for human inclusive- fitness issues, this variant of sociobiology has expressed little interest in what we already know about the brains and behaviors of non-human animals— facts that should be of foundational importance for thinking about many human abilities. To create a lasting understanding of ‘human nature', we must incorporate the lessons from the past half-century of research on subcortical emotional and motivational systems that all mammals share. Seven examples of how a study of these systems can highlight some of the core problems of evolutionary psychology are outlined. From this perspective, the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the ‘modularized' human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained. By simply accepting the remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development, genetically-dictated, sociobiological ‘modules' begin to resemble products of dubious human ambition rather than of sound scientific reasoning.},

abstract = {Charles Darwin's "On the Origins of Species" had two principal goals: to show that species had not been separately created and to show that natural selection had been the main force behind their proliferation and descent from common ancestors. In "Coevolution," the author proposes a powerful new theory of cultural evolution--that is, of the descent with modification of the shared conceptual systems we call "cultures"--that is parallel in many ways to Darwin's theory of organic evolution. The author suggests that a process of cultural selection, or preservation by preference, driven chiefly by choice or imposition depending on the circumstances, has been the main but not exclusive force of cultural change. He shows that this process gives rise to five major patterns or "modes" in which cultural change is at odds with genetic change. Each of the five modes is discussed in some detail and its existence confirmed through one or more case studies chosen for their heuristic value, the robustness of their data, and their broader implications. But "Coevolution" predicts not simply the existence of the five modes of gene-culture relations; it also predicts their relative importance in the ongoing dynamics of cultural change in particular cases. The case studies themselves are lucid and innovative reexaminations of an array of oft-pondered anthropological topics--plural marriage, sickle-cell anemia, basic color terms, adult lactose absorption, incest taboos, headhunting, and cannibalism. In a general case, the author's goal is to demonstrate that an evolutionary analysis of both genes and culture has much to contribute to our understanding of human diversity, particularly behavioral diversity, and thus to the resolution of age-old questions about nature and nurture, genes and culture.},

abstract = {Because immunological defence against pathogens is costly and merely reactive, human anti-pathogen defence is also characterized by proactive behavioural mechanisms that inhibit contact with pathogens in the first place. This behavioural immune system comprises psychological processes that infer infection risk from perceptual cues, and that respond to these perceptual cues through the activation of aversive emotions, cognitions and behavioural impulses. These processes are engaged flexibly, producing context-contingent variation in the nature and magnitude of aversive responses. These processes have important implications for human social cognition and social behaviour-including implications for social gregariousness, person perception, intergroup prejudice, mate preferences, sexual behaviour and conformity. Empirical evidence bearing on these many implications is reviewed and discussed. This review also identifies important directions for future research on the human behavioural immune system--including the need for enquiry into underlying mechanisms, additional behavioural consequences and implications for human health and well-being.},

abstract = {We propose that moral condemnation functions to guide bystanders to choose the same side as other bystanders in disputes. Humans interact in dense social networks, and this poses a problem for bystanders when conflicts arise: which side, if any, to support. Choosing sides is a difficult strategic problem because the outcome of a conflict critically depends on which side other bystanders support. One strategy is siding with the higher status disputant, which can allow bystanders to coordinate with one another to take the same side, reducing fighting costs. However, this strategy carries the cost of empowering high-status individuals to exploit others. A second possible strategy is choosing sides based on preexisting relationships. This strategy balances power but carries another cost: Bystanders choose different sides, and this discoordination causes escalated conflicts and high fighting costs. We propose that moral cognition is designed to manage both of these problems by implementing a dynamic coordination strategy in which bystanders coordinate side-taking based on a public signal derived from disputants' actions rather than their identities. By focusing on disputants' actions, bystanders can dynamically change which individuals they support across different disputes, simultaneously solving the problems of coordination and exploitation. We apply these ideas to explain a variety of otherwise mysterious moral phenomena.},

As hypothesized, the results across 21 nations show that: (a) propensity for ecological threat correlates with short (S) allele frequency in the 5-HTTLPR, (b) allelic frequency in the 5-HTTLPR and vulnerability to ecological threat both correlate with cultural tightness-looseness, (c) susceptibility to ecological threat predicts tightness-looseness via the mediation of S allele carriers, and (d) frequency of S allele carriers predicts justifiability of morally relevant behavior via tightness-looseness.

The age of this capacity has for long been subject to controversy. We apply phylogenetic principles to date this capacity, integrating evidence from archaeology, genetics, paleoanthropology, and linguistics. We show that cultural capacity is older than the first split in the modern human lineage, and at least 170,000 years old, based on data on hyoid bone morphology, FOXP2 alleles, agreement between genetic and language trees, fire use, burials, and the early appearance of tools comparable to those of modern hunter-gatherers. We cannot exclude that Neanderthals had cultural capacity some 500,000 years ago. A capacity for complex culture, therefore, must have existed before complex culture itself. It may even originated long before. This seeming paradox is resolved by theoretical models suggesting that cultural evolution is exceedingly slow in its initial stages.},

The application of this culture-gene coevolutionary approach to understanding human social psychology has generated novel insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of large-scale cooperation, social norms and ethnicity. This approach hypothesizes a norm-psychology: a suite of psychological adaptations for inferring, encoding in memory, adhering to, enforcing and redressing violations of the shared behavioral standards of one's community. After reviewing the substantial body of formal theory underpinning these predictions, we outline how this account organizes diverse empirical findings in the cognitive sciences and related disciplines.

We compare two current historical-evolutionary hypotheses for this variation based on (1) effective large-scale institutions and (2) pathogen threats by analyzing cross-national differences (N = 122) in in-group preferences measured in three ways. We find that the effectiveness of government institutions correlates with favoring in-group members, even when controlling for pathogen stress and world region, assessing reverse causality, and providing a check on endogeneity with an instrumental variable analysis. Conversely, pathogen stress shows inconsistent associations with in-group favoritism when controlling for government effectiveness. Moreover, pathogen stress shows little to no association with in-group favoritism within major world regions whereas government effectiveness does.

abstract = {Empirical findings have identified spirituality as a potential health resource. Whereas older research has associated such effects with the social component of religion, newer conceptualizations propose that spiritual experiences and the intrapersonal effects that are facilitated by regular spiritual practice might be pivotal to understanding potential salutogenesis. Ongoing studies suggest that spiritual experiences and practices involve a variety of neural systems that may facilitate neural 'top-down' effects that are comparable if not identical to those engaged in placebo responses. As meaningfulness seems to be both a hallmark of spirituality and placebo reactions, it may be regarded as an overarching psychological concept that is important to engaging and facilitating psychophysiological mechanisms that are involved in health-related effects. Empirical evidence suggests that spirituality may under certain conditions be a predictor of placebo response and effects. Assessment of patients' spirituality and making use of various resources to accommodate patients' spiritual needs reflect our most current understanding of the physiological, psychological and socio-cultural aspects of spirituality, and may also increase the likelihood of eliciting self-healing processes. We advocate the position that a research agenda addressing responses and effects of both placebo and spirituality could therefore be (i) synergistic, (ii) valuable to each phenomenon on its own, and (iii) contributory to an extended placebo paradigm that is centred around the concept of meaningfulness.},

Mounting evidence from the animal lesion and human neuroimaging literatures suggests that physical and social pain overlap in their underlying neural circuitry and computational processes. We review evidence suggesting that the anterior cingulate cortex plays a key role in the physical-social pain overlap.

abstract = {Decades-long field research has flowered into integrative studies that, together with experimental evidence for the requisite social learning capacities, have indicated a reliance on multiple traditions ('cultures') in a small number of species. It is increasingly evident that there is great variation in manifestations of social learning, tradition and culture among species, offering much scope for evolutionary analysis. Social learning has been identified in a range of vertebrate and invertebrate species, yet sustained traditions appear rarer, and the multiple traditions we call cultures are rarer still. Here, we examine relationships between this variation and both social intelligence--sophisticated information processing adapted to the social domain--and encephalization. First, we consider whether culture offers one particular confirmation of the social ('Machiavellian') intelligence hypothesis that certain kinds of social life (here, culture) select for intelligence: 'you need to be smart to sustain culture'. Phylogenetic comparisons, particularly focusing on our own study animals, the great apes, support this, but we also highlight some paradoxes in a broader taxonomic survey. Second, we use intraspecific variation to address the converse hypothesis that 'culture makes you smart', concluding that recent evidence for both chimpanzees and orangutans support this proposition.},

abstract = {For collective action to evolve and be maintained by selection, the mind must be equipped with mechanisms designed to identify free riders--individuals who do not contribute to a collective project but still benefit from it. Once identified, free riders must be either punished or excluded from future collective actions. But what criteria does the mind use to categorize someone as a free rider? An evolutionary analysis suggests that failure to contribute is not sufficient. Failure to contribute can occur by intention or accident, but the adaptive threat is posed by those who are motivated to benefit themselves at the expense of cooperators. In 6 experiments, we show that only individuals with exploitive intentions were categorized as free riders, even when holding their actual level of contribution constant (Studies 1 and 2). In contrast to an evolutionary model, rational choice and reinforcement theory suggest that different contribution levels (leading to different payoffs for their cooperative partners) should be key. When intentions were held constant, however, differences in contribution level were not used to categorize individuals as free riders, although some categorization occurred along a competence dimension (Study 3). Free rider categorization was not due to general tendencies to categorize (Study 4) or to mechanisms that track a broader class of intentional moral violations (Studies 5A and 5B). The results reveal the operation of an evolved concept with features tailored for solving the collective action problems faced by ancestral hunter-gatherers.},

abstract = {Throughout the world people differ in the magnitude with which they value strong family ties or heightened religiosity. We propose that this cross-cultural variation is a result of a contingent psychological adaptation that facilitates in-group assortative sociality in the face of high levels of parasite-stress while devaluing in-group assortative sociality in areas with low levels of parasite-stress. This is because in-group assortative sociality is more important for the avoidance of infection from novel parasites and for the management of infection in regions with high levels of parasite-stress compared with regions of low infectious disease stress. We examined this hypothesis by testing the predictions that there would be a positive association between parasite-stress and strength of family ties or religiosity. We conducted this study by comparing among nations and among states in the United States of America. We found for both the international and the interstate analyses that in-group assortative sociality was positively associated with parasite-stress. This was true when controlling for potentially confounding factors such as human freedom and economic development. The findings support the parasite-stress theory of sociality, that is, the proposal that parasite-stress is central to the evolution of social life in humans and other animals.},

abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these "standard subjects" are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Here, we challenge the view that evolutionary theory prescribes stereotyped sex roles in human beings, firstly by reviewing Bateman's principles and recent sexual selection theory and, secondly, by examining data on mating behaviour and reproductive success in current and historic human populations. We argue that human mating strategies are unlikely to conform to a single universal pattern.},

This shift in focus--from knowledge acquisition to the adaptive regulation of behavior--provides new ways of thinking about every topic in psychology. It suggests a mind populated by a large number of adaptive specializations, each equipped with content-rich representations, concepts, inference systems, and regulatory variables, which are functionally organized to solve the complex problems of survival and reproduction encountered by the ancestral hunter-gatherers from whom we are descended. We present recent empirical examples that illustrate how this approach has been used to discover new features of attention, categorization, reasoning, learning, emotion, and motivation.},

For both time frames we propose a two-step sequence: first a second-personal morality in which individuals are sympathetic or fair to particular others, and second an agent-neutral morality in which individuals follow and enforce group-wide social norms. Human morality arose evolutionarily as a set of skills and motives for cooperating with others, and the ontogeny of these skills and motives unfolds in part naturally and in part as a result of sociocultural contexts and interactions.},

We prefer to associate with those who are similar to us over those who are different, preferentially allocate resources to similar others, and hold more positive beliefs about similar others. Here we investigate the developmental origins of these biases, asking if preference for similar others occurs prior to language and extensive exposure to cultural norms. We demonstrate that, like adults, prelinguistic infants prefer those who share even trivial similarities with themselves, and these preferences appear to reflect a cognitive comparison process ("like me"/"not like me"). However, unlike adults, infants do not appear to prefer others with an utterly arbitrary similarity to themselves. Together, these findings suggest that the phenomena of ingroup bias, and enhanced interpersonal attraction toward those who resemble ourselves, may be rooted in an inherent preference for similarity to self, which itself may be enhanced during development by the influence of cultural values.},

We examined the prevalence and predictors of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in 1,628 women with breast cancer and 674 women without breast cancer who participated in a multicenter population-based case-control study of Black and White women, 35 to 64 years of age. Among cases, 2.4{\%} and 2.3{\%} carried deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. BRCA1 mutations were significantly more common in White (2.9{\%}) versus Black (1.4{\%}) cases and in Jewish (10.2{\%}) versus non-Jewish (2.0{\%}) cases; BRCA2 mutations were slightly more frequent in Black (2.6{\%}) versus White (2.1{\%}) cases. Numerous familial and demographic factors were significantly associated with BRCA1 and, to a lesser extent, BRCA2 carrier status, when examined individually. In models considering all predictors together, early onset ages in cases and in relatives, family history of ovarian cancer, and Jewish ancestry remained strongly and significantly predictive of BRCA1 carrier status, whereas BRCA2 predictors were fewer and more modest in magnitude.

abstract = {Intro Paragraph: Signaling theory provides an opportunity to integrate an interac- tive theory of symbolic communication and social benefit with materialist theories of individual strategic action and adaptation. This article examines the potential explanatory value of signal- ing theory for a variety of anthropological topics, focusing on three social arenas in which signaling might plausibly be impor- tant: unconditional generosity, “wasteful” subsistence behavior, and artistic or craft traditions. In each case, it outlines the ways in which the phenomena correspond with the expectations of signaling theory by showing how a given pattern of action might signal particular hidden attributes, provide benefits to both sig- naler and observers, and meet the conditions for honest commu- nication. The ethnographic evidence suggests that the fundamen- tal conditions for reliable signaling of condition-dependent qualities may exist in many social domains.

annote = {how a given pattern of action might signal particular hidden attributes, provide benefits to both sig- naler and observers, and meet the conditions for honest communication

The ethnographic evidence suggests that the fundamen- tal conditions for reliable signaling of condition-dependent qualities may exist in many social domains

The power of these analyses lies in the focus on individuals as strategic decision-makers and on empirically tractable measures of costs and outcomes

the more ritualized and communal aspects of social behavior, those that appear to be driven by cultural meaning and collective interest more than by individual gain, have proven difficult to explain.

While evolutionary and ecological anthropologists have rightly emphasized the importance of such components of adaptive success as food acqui- sition, mate choice, and resource competition, they have paid insufficient attention to social, symbolic, and prestige-related aspects of individual strategizing

These components of cultural behavior may appear to generate benefits that are unmeasurable or that favor social groups at the expense of their individual members

There also exists a long-standing parallel set of theo-
retical concepts in social theory dating back to Thorstein Veblen and Marcel Mauss and more recently refined by Pierre Bourdieu. For these theorists, individually costly but collectively beneficial (or at least prestigious) behav- iors such as public generosity or extravagant piety are a form of social competition: the most generous or self- sacrificial individuals gain higher prestige, and the re- cipients or observers gain material benefit at the expense of their own prestige (Veblen 1994 [1899], Mauss 1924, Fried 1967)

Our goal here is to show how these various evolutionary, eco- nomic, and social theories about communication and status can be unified within a single theoretical framework: signaling theory

Signaling theory pro- vides a way to articulate idealist notions of the intangible social benefits that might be gained through symbolic representations of self with more materialist notions of individuals as self-interested but socially embedded decision makers

By paying attention to the problem ofhow credibility is maintained when individuals have to make interdependent decisions (about mates, alliances, con- flict, and trust) based on incomplete information, sig- naling theory provides a new interpretation of such sym- bolic performance as aesthetic elaboration, initiation rites, ethnic boundaries, ceremonial feasting, wealth cir- culation, conspicuous consumption, monumental archi- tecture, religious commitment, and the individually costly provisioning of collective goods

We focus on three likely arenas for signaling dynamics: unconditional gen- erosity, “wasteful” subsistence activities, and artistic elaboration

Conspicuous Consumption
Veblen also realized that variations in the cost or in-
tensity of the display allowed fine distinctions to be made between individuals who are competing within specific social arenas for status and its perquisites (such as quality mates and powerful allies

The Gift:
Marcel Mauss tackled the conspicuous generosity characteristic of precapitalist societies with an eye to criticizing the notion that the benefits of such phenomena as the kula and potlatch lay in narrow economic notions of profit maximization

in such gift-giving systems transfers forimmediateeconomic gain were “viewed with the greatest disdain” (1924:36).

Mauss con- cluded that conspicuous giving was based on a super- structural economy of prestige: “Nowhere else is the prestige of an individual as closely bound up with ex- penditure. . . . Consumption and destruction are virtually unlimited....The rich man who shows his wealth by spending recklessly is the man who wins prestige.”

An Outline of a Theory of Practice
Bourdieu argues that the accumulation of sym- bolic capital is just as “rational” as the accumulation of economic capital, particularly since such capital may be freely converted from one form to another, ultimately in order to gain advantages in the form of additional wealth, power, allies, and marriage partners

For Bourdieu, the highest profits in symbolic cap- ital can be attained when individuals act in ways that reliably demonstrate lack of interest in material acqui- sition by engaging in conspicuous consumption or con- spicuous generosity. The value of the display in terms of its symbolic capital lies in the cost of the investment in terms of time, energy, or wealth (Bourdieu 1977, 1990; Turner 1991)

“credit of renown,” at a time when marriage ne- gotiations are critical (1990:120). He argues that this “ex- hibition of symbolic capital (which is always very ex- pensive in economic terms)” increases the family's social standing by displaying the quality of its goods, which is in turn linked to the attributes of its members

Distinction (1984:281):
The objects endowed with the greatest distinctive power are those which most clearly attest the qual- ity of the appropriation, and therefore the quality of their owner, because their possession requires time and capacities which, requiring a long investment of time, like pictorial or musical culture, cannot be ac- quired in haste or by proxy, and which therefore appear as the surest indications of the quality of the person. This explains the importance which the pursuit of distinction attaches to all those activities which, like artistic consumption, demand pure, pointless expenditure, especially of the rarest and most precious thing of all . . . namely, time.

The apparent paradox of wastefully expending time and wealth is dis- solved if the cost of the display functions to ensure that only high-quality individuals can afford them at all

Thus, the signal value of conspicuous consumption is maintained by its costs; these costs in turn are the price wealthy individuals pay for prestige.

First, costliness is not always necessary to guarantee signal value. Some signals maintain symbolic value because they are indexically related to that which they signify: they are simply impossible to fake. For example, the head flattening prac- ticed by some Native American tribes to distinguish the free-born from slaves was a reliable signal not because of its cost but because it could be performed only for children on the initiative of free-born parents

Second, while Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital explains how costs ensure honesty, none of these accounts of sig- naling theory explainwhyan honest display confers pres- tige. Why would it be to the benefit of others to defer to one who signals his or her social or economic superiority—in other words, why tolerate inequality?

Those seeking assurance that a given individual has sufficient personal resources or belongs to a kin group of sufficient resource holdings or productivity to qualify as either an equal or a social superior do not need to put their faith in words but can examine the evidence of deeds, such as displays of generosity or waste, that are too costly to be worth faking.

Inequality is tolerated when sig- nalers demonstrate their competitive superiority, and deference (or interest in the signal) provides greater ben- efits than resistance (or ignoring the signal).

The Evolutionary Ecology of Signaling:

1. the “run- away” approach:
relatively arbitrary observer preferences (e.g., for mates with showy plum- age) that are correlated via genetic inheritance to signals (e.g., because offspring inherit both the preference and the signal) can lead to the elaboration of signals over evolutionary time as preferences and signals coevolve. 

there is relatively little direct empirical evidence for such processes

2. the sensory-exploitation view:
The sensory-exploitation view of signal evolution shares with the run- away approach the assumption that observers have pre- existing preferences (perhaps evolved in other contexts) which lead them to be attracted to certain signals and that signals which “exploit” these preferences by being even more elaborate (so-called supernormal stimuli) can be favored even if they are relatively arbitrary or mala- daptive (Ryan 1998).


3. the costly-signaling or handicap approach:
We focus on the costly-signaling approach here be-
cause its focus on communication, direct parallels with social theory, and attention to strategic action make it the most clearly relevant to anthropological contexts

costly-signaling theory involves the communication of attributes that are rela- tively difficult or expensive to perceive directly and that vary in quality, intensity, or degree between signalers (either groups or individuals)

The fundamental problem addressed by costly-signaling theory is how individuals with partially competing interests may nevertheless mu- tually benefit from signaling these differences in quality. For this mutual gain to be realized, the two parties must find ways to guarantee at least partial honesty of the information they communicate.

But in the real world, both routinely misleading signals and unconditional honesty seem to be relatively uncommon. The costly-signaling approach suggests that the persistence of reliable com- munication emerges from conditions ensuring that hon- esty is the best move in the game of communication: both players do better by cooperating (giving an honest signal or paying attention to the information) than by attempting to defect (lying about one's intentions or qualities or ignoring the signal)

Many ungulates (deer, antelopes, etc.) react to a nearby predator by seemingly paradoxical be- havior—displaying a prominent rump patch, leaping high into the air rather than running straight away, and so on. These actions are paradoxical because they seem designed to attract the predator's attention and act to slow the prey's progress in escaping. The paradox di- minishes if these actions are viewed as signals from the prey that tell the predator “I have detected you, and I am in excellent condition, so it is a waste of your time to chase me.”

If this is a truthful signal, the predator benefits by saving the energy expended in a chase that will likely be fruitless, and the prey obviously benefits by avoiding the cost of a lengthy and tiring escape



The conditions for the evolutionary or game-theoretical stability of costly signaling can be specified as follows (for more technical analyses, see Grafen 1990, Johnstone 1997, Gintis, Smith, and Bowles 2001):

1. Members of a social group vary in some underlying attribute (physical condition, resource endowment,need, motivation) that is difficult or impossible to observe but could in principle be reliably signaled

2. Observers stand to gain from accurate information
about this variation in attribute quality. 

3. Signalers and recipients have conflicting interests in the sense that successful deceit (e.g., appearing to be a fleeter prey, a more dangerous adversary, or a more attractive mate than is in fact the case) would benefit signalers at the expense of the recipients. 

4. Signal cost or benefit (to the signaler) is quality- dependent (i.e., the marginal cost of the signal is nega- tively correlated with the signaler's quality or the mar- ginal benefit is positively correlated with the same). When

When these conditions are met, we can expect one or
more “design forces” (i.e., decision making, subcon- scious learning, natural selection, or adaptive cultural transmission) to favor a system of communication con- forming to the costly-signaling framework

artistic elaboration
They usually also pro- duce nonutilitarian objects used purely for decoration or as wealth objects, as well as aesthetically elaborated magico-religious paraphernalia.

Bowser (2000) has extensively analyzed ceramics cur-
rently produced by amixed Achuar-Quichua community in Ecuador. Efforts at fine craftsmanship and aesthetic elaboration are concentrated on bowls used for serving visitors, especially those for chicha (fermented manioc beer)

We propose that the audience and the nature of the
signal sent by the potter through the aesthetic quality of the pottery change over a woman's life course. She may begin with signals of skill: symmetry (challenging in these hand-coiled pots), wall thinness, delicacy of dec- oration, and the like. These may indicate intrinsic qual- ities (fine motor control, cognitive abilities, etc.) or signal time devoted to developing these skills (itself a measure of time available for investment in nonsubsistence activities)

More skilled potters make more attractive marriage part- ners and thus have increased opportunity to belong to a stronger political faction and have better alliance partners than less skilled potters

As in Bowser's pottery study, we see here that women, not just men, actively signal to potential mates and allies and that artistic effort and skill appear to be important means by which indi- viduals attempt to distinguish their qualities from those of others

Signaling theory suggests that stylistic traditions in
the arts exist in part to highlight individual variation in skill, much as conformity to routines in gymnastics or other sports facilitates observer discrimination of skill differences between competitors (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997).

Thus, “decorative styles might converge on com- mon standards in order to facilitate invidious compari- son within the group” and, ironically, conformity might actually be a result of individuals' attempting to distin- guish themselves from each other (Boone, personal com- munication).

One of the classic lessons of anthropology has been that economic activity is not just about making a living but about communicating values and expressing meaning.

Finding a suitable spouse involves time and effort, especially if it is difficult to discern the qualities of the various choices. In addition, it is difficult to learn from direct personal experience because choos- ing a mate occurs too infrequently during one person's lifetime to produce a sufficiently large sample (Thaler 1992). 


Exchange is the most basic form of cooperation, and, in fact, signaling theory rests on the assumption that there are mutual benefits to be gained from truthful communication. 


In these mutualistic contests, signals allow people to solve what game theoreticians call coordina- tion or assurance games (Binmore 1994) 


One can conceive of coordination as an exchange in which it pays for players to cooperate (i.e., there are mutual benefits to be gained, in contrast to a prisoner's dilemma, in which it always pays to defect).  The key for the partic- ipants in such an exchange is to increase the likelihood, or assurance, that their partners will “play by the same rules”  


But how do we know whom to trust? With whom do we share these arbitrary details of social life? These ques- tions concern identifying attributes of others that are relatively difficult or expensive to perceive directly. Among other advantages, the cultural mechanisms involved in signaling provide people the ability to infer each other's mental states, to assort preferentially with others who have similar (or complementary) intentions or capabilities, and to reap the advantages of coordinated activities (Tomasello 1999).

The paper could have been more explicit about the
extent to which the emitters and interpreters of costly signals understand their actions.

Specifically, costly-signaling theory is relevant where there are confluences of interest between individual signalers and individual receivers in contexts where the broader categories to which signalers and receivers belong have conflicting interests

For example, predators and prey as categories have conflicting interests, but in- dividual predators and individual prey, like the ungu- lates mentioned by Bliege Bird and Smith, experience a confluence of interests if the prey are truly capable of making a pursuit not worth the predator's bother. The conflict of interest in that case is not between the alert, physically fit individual of the prey species and the predator but rather between different members of the prey species

While Bliege Bird and Smith will turn waste into nonwaste and explain the expenditures involved by appealing to the “manipulation of social relations” and “status building” (and their ultimate reproductive ben- efits), I suggest that it may be a by-product of the human mind that may serve no purpose at all. Moreover, waste—even if costly—can be fun; the mind can derive pleasure from wasteful acts (signaling in this case) that are costly because the mind also “plays.” While some may argue that it actually needs to play, I will go farther and claim that it does so even when there is no apparent need as such.

The selective incentive may not be social status (with its additional political and reproductive gains) but the survival of the group regardless of individual personal status. Indeed, the fact that not all humans are equally motivated to reproduce and that a significant portion of

Hagen and Hammerstein
The essence of signaling theory, as Bliege Bird and Smith explain, is what is variously termed private, incomplete, or asymmetrical information—some participants in a so- cial interaction have difficult-to-observe qualities that are critical to the decision making of other participants.

Hagen and Bryant (2003) argue that group displays of music and dance and other forms of elaborate cultural productionmaybe cred- ible signals of coalition quality because they require the long-term association of the participants as well as the surplus production necessary to support the cultural producers.

1. reliable signals of coalition quality per- mit the evolution of group-level alliances resulting in uniquely human regionwide social structures (in con- trast, the segmentary lineage system of hamadryas ba- boons requires consanguineal ties 

2. these signals entail cultural transmission. Given that song learning in birds is one of the few clear cases of cultural transmission in nonhuman animals and that singing is common in apes (i.e., gibbons and siamangs), coalition signaling may be important to the evolution of human cultural transmission as, for example, a preadap- tation for other forms of culture.

REPLY:

Such signals are not necessarily designed to acquire immediate reproductive advantages but do function as a way to acquire social, symbolic, or material benefit

These benefits may translate into competitive advantages in acquiring strong marriage alliances or a high-quality partner, in reducing infant mortality, or in achieving access to resources during periods of scarcity—all of which could have reproductive benefit

If desire for increased power and social status is enough to motivate signaling strategies (Chibnik), why bother with reproductive advantages?

- The problem here is the failure to distinguish between proximate and ultimate (evolu- tionary) causality (Mayr 1965).Within limits, people pre- fer more status or power to less, wealth to poverty, and so on. The only nonteleological and nonmystical expla- nation for these preferences (and the innate and learned cognitive processes which underlie them) is the theory of natural selection.

Natural selection favors cognitive mechanisms that motivate strategic behavior correlated with reproductive success, whether or not this is something the actors are consciously aware of.

Indeed, signaling theory is designed to explain why and under what conditions hon- est communication might be in both parties' interest— it does not predict that communication must always be honest. If the fundamental conditions for costly or hon- est signaling are not met, we should expect to see a great deal of lying, deceit, and misdirection},

"We believe that costly male rites are an adaptive res-
ponse that emerges among warring communities to reduce free-riding and promote cooperation during warfare (cf. MacNeill, 2004)"

free-riding during warfare is the foremost collective action problem that costly male rites are designed to cope with

- nonstratified foraging societies
that engage in warfare maintain the costliest male rites.

- the types of warfare in which communities engage influence the costs and variety of rituals performed:
External warfare is associated with permanent markers
internal warfare is associated with ritual activities that do not leave permanent visible signs

- group size and political organisation is important: communities with punitive and political institutions may be less dependent on ritual signs of commitment than small egalitarian societies because they can effectively punish defectors.






Problem with religion: explaining the willingness of religious adherents to perform acts that appear to entail significant somatic and reproductive costs (234)

seem particularly acute among male rites

subincisions,
skin hangings, 
exposure to fire, 
teeth pullings, 
other traumas

some [communities] are totally devoid of male rites and others may require nothing more than the acquisition of clandestine teachings

Why do societies vary so broadly in the ritual costs they demand of their males?


Sexual selection and Zahavian signaling theory:
these studies examined whether males and females use scarification as a form of mating competition in which performers signal their resistance to pathogens, willingness to endure pain, or overall genetic quality...Their results are largely unsuppor- tive or inconclusive, suggesting the need to explore alternative explanations (234)


we examine whether costly male rites serve to reliably signal group commitments

social bonding is not an end in itself but a means to facilitate intra-group cooperation. 

- Irons (2001, 2004) posits that the primary adaptive benefit of religious behavior is its ability to foster cooperation and overcome problems of collective action that humans have faced throughout their evolutionary history

only those who are committed to the group's beliefs and goals will be willing to incur the time, energetic, and opportunity costs of ritual performance. 

In other words, individuals pay the costs of ritual performance, but by doing so they demonstrate their commitment and loyalty to the group and can thus achieve a net benefit from successful collective action (235)


Sosis and colleagues examined ritual behaviour in overcoming collective action problems:

1. frequency of participation in costly ritual behavior was correlated with individual levels of cooperation, 
2. among religious communes, commune longevity was correlated with the costliness of ritual demands. 

While these studies focused on how communities resolve the free-rider dilemmas surrounding cooperative resource acquisition and consumption, throughout our evolutionary history individuals have faced an array of other collective action problems, most notably warfare:

Distinct mating strategies and gender roles in activities such as resource acquisition and inter- group conflict suggest that the salient ecological problems for males and females are likely to differ (235).


Group Commitment:

four necessary conditions for the evolutionary stability of a costly signaling system in a population (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005):

1. within-group variance in some unobservable attribute
2. Observers can benefit from reliable information about this variance
3. Higher-quality signalers can benefit from accurately broadcasting this information, but lower-quality signalers have the potential to achieve benefits at the expense of recipients through deception
4. the cost or benefit to the signaler of sending the signal is correlated with the signaler's quality

Religious behaviours meet these conditions (Sosis 2005, 2006):

(1) the intensity of religious beliefs varies within communities and this variance is unobservable

(2) individuals benefit from accurate information about this variance because intensity of belief is related to one's commitment to the group and its goals, committed members being more likely to be cooperators and thus preferred social partners

(3) religious groups offer various benefits for members that are mutually provided and are at risk of exploitation by those not committed to group goals

(4) the cost or benefit of ritual performance is weighed against opportunity costs that are expected to be higher for skeptics than for believers since believers will have genuinely forsaken many behaviors deemed unsuitable by religious doctrine, while skeptics will not have abandoned these behaviors (235)

religious behavior can be understood as a costly signal that reliably advertises the unobservable condition of religious belief and group commitment. The time, energetic, material, and opportunity costs of religious activity serve to deter those who lack sufficient belief from displaying the signal, consequently increasing trust and solidarity among signaling group members.


High-quality signalers, in other words those committed to the group, are assumed to realize reproductive gains via increased reputa- tional status and group-wide benefits achieved through successful collective action

individuals who have the most to gain from signaling their group loyalties should be the ones who exhibit the highest intensity of ritual performance

While there is often intra-group variance in ritual performance, religious doctrines or group norms establish minimum levels of ritual performance required for group membership (236)

Interdependence versus independent interaction:
Groups that face the greatest risk of exploitation by free-riders, owing to inherent challenges in distinguishing committed group members from free-riders, should on average require and exhibit higher levels of ritual costs than groups that face lower risk of exploitation by free-riders (236)

if ritual requirements safeguard the benefits of group membership, required ritual costs should be higher in groups that offer greater benefits to their members

if facilitating cooperation is the general ecological problem that rituals emerge to solve, those groups that confront the most significant challenges of collective action (owing to difficulties in distinguishing members from free-riders or defending substantial group benefits) will require the most demanding rituals of their community members in order to deter free-riders from exploiting the benefits attained through collective action

expect group size and genetic relatedness to independently impact the costliness of ritual activities

Group Size: 
larger groups will face greater free-rider problems (Olson, 1965) and they will therefore experience increased selective pressures favoring costlier rites that can deter free-riders

expect groups composed of related male kin, such as patrilocal societies, to have less costly male rites than communities composed of unrelated males because closely related males have expectations of solidarity on the basis of their kin ties, and should therefore be less dependent on independent costly signals of commitment (236)

Collective action problems: 

resource acquisitions: Cooperative hunting and concomitant band-wide food sharing
(Alvard {\&} Nolin, 2002; Gurven, 2004; Sosis, 2000b)

- this literature, however, has not examined the possibility that collective rituals might facilitate these activities by enhancing intra-group trust and commitment. If costly ritual actions promote cooperation, we may expect the costliness of male rites across societies to be correlated with the importance among males of cooperative resource acquisition and consumption.


warfare: "A war party faces the problem of altruism par excellence. Every member has an incentive to cheat by keeping himself out of harm's way and exposing others to greater risk" (Pinker)

Whether attacking or defending, each individual who defects places the remaining group members at greater risk of injury or death. Thus, when warfare is frequent within a society, reliable signals of intra-group commitment that increase solidarity, such as ritual performance, should be highly favored by selective mechanisms (236)

Competetive sport and exercise is a suitable analogy here - regular—week in week out—warfare as a war party...


Internal warfare versus external warfare: 

Groups engaged in external warfare are concerned about uniting unrelated males and fielding as large a combat unit as possible. However, when imbalances of power occur within a region, smaller groups are at risk of their members defecting to larger and more powerful groups 

For these communities, permanent markers would serve to minimize the ability of men to abscond to another group


Because of the greater inclusive fitness costs associated with defection in external warfare, as well as the costliness of permanent markers, we expect external warfare to elicit costlier signals of commit- ment than internal warfare

Societies that engage in both internal and external warfare will face tradeoffs in the cost- liness of their commitment signals, especially their willing- ness to submit to permanent markers, and we therefore expect them to maintain rites at an intermediate level of costliness between societies with only external or internal warfare

Mate Quality:
Using Bliege Bird and Smith's conditions for ecolutionary stability of a costly signal argument that scarification or tattoos signal pathogen resistance: (1) males vary in their resistance to pathogens; (2) since this variance is likely to correlate with the benefits males can provide directly to mates (e.g., resource acquisition, protection), as well as the quality of jointly produced offspring (to the extent this resistance is heritable), females benefit from accurate knowledge about this variance; (3) males who have high pathogen resistance can increase their mating opportunities by accurately broadcasting this information, but men who are less resistant can benefit if they are able to deceive females about their level of resistance; and (4) the cost to males of exposing themselves to pathogens through ritual tattoos and lacerations is negatively correlated with their resistance to pathogens

- If male rites signal mate quality we expect the intensity
of these rites to increase as the competition for mates increases

Hypotheses:

3.1. Demography and kinship:
1. The costliness of a society's male rites will be positively correlated with community size.
2. Patrilocal societies will have less costly male rites than societies in which males reside among unrelated men.

3.2. Resource acquisition and sharing:
3. The costliness of a society's male rites will be positively correlated with the importance of male cooperative resource acquisition.
4. The costliness of a society's male rites will be positively correlated with the intensity of food sharing.

3.3 Warfare:

5. The costliness of a society's male rites will be positively correlated with the frequency of warfare.
6. The type of warfare a society engages in will be a significant predictor of the costliness of male rites. Societies with external warfare only will have the most costly male rites, followed by societies with both external and internal warfare, then societies with internal warfare only, and societies without warfare will maintain the least costly male rites.
7. Societies with external warfare will require their males to bear more permanent markers than societies without external warfare.
8. Societies with internal warfare only will require their males to endure less permanent markers than societies without internal warfare only

3.4 Mating
9. Males in polygynous societies will perform costlier male rites than males in nonpolygynous societies.
10. Males in nonstratified polygynous societies will perform costlier male rites than males in polygynous stratified societies.

Eastern Toraja: In this society, boys are subincised (a cut along the bottom of the penis) yearly beginning at 6 years old and ending at 15. Around age 12, boys are circumcised in a public ritual. Young boys have their ears pierced by their mothers. There is a public initiation rite into manhood where boys are cut on their arms, hands, and legs, as well as, burned on the torso and arms. Boys cannot show any pain during the public ceremo- nies. Men paint their bodies daily. 

Pawnee: Men paint their faces in this society.

Kinship:
- nonpatrilocal societies do not have costlier male rites than patrilocal societies (F1,59=0.27, p=.61). 
- examined whether patrilineal descent was associated with the costliness of male rituals, but also found no relationship (F1,60=0.40, p=.53). 
- Costliness of rituals did not vary either with community size:
There was a nonsignificant negative trend (opposite of our prediction) of the natural log of community size estimates in our sample and the costliness of male rites (F3,60=1.25, p=.30).

Resrouce acquisition and sharing:
None of our measures of cooperative resource acqui-
sition and consumption are predictors of the costliness of male rites: cooperative production (F1,58=0.20, p=.66), food sharing (F1,58=0.37, p=.55), and socialization for cooperation (F1,59=0.12, p=.73).
Our data indicate that foragers do indeed share food more extensively than nonforagers (F1,58=5.20, p=.03), yet they do not significantly differ from other subsistence groups in their reliance on cooperative production (F1,58=1.66, p=.20) or socialization for cooperation (F1,59=0.03, p=.85). Foragers do exhibit costlier ritual signals than nonforagers (F1,60=6.63, p=.01), and forag- ing remains a significant predictor of the costliness of male rites in independent ANOVA models with cooper- ative production, food sharing, and socialization for cooperation, while these other measures of cooperation remain insignificant

Warfare:
- warfare frequency is the most significant
predictor of ritual costs in our dataset (F1,60=12.47, pb.001)
- The costliness of male rites for societies in which warfare is present is significantly higher than in societies without warfare (F1,60=7.33, p=.009)
(this relationship holds for both external warfare (F1,43=11.49, p=.002) and internal warfare (F1,39=5.95, p=.02).)
- males in societies that engage in external warfare only perform the costliest rites, followed by societies that engage in external and internal warfare, internal warfare only, and, lastly, no warfare (F3,60=5.36, p=.003)
- the differences between internal warfare only, internal and external warfare, and external warfare only are not significant. Table 4 shows that there is an interaction effect between internal and external warfare; when external warfare is present the presence of internal warfare does not impact the costliness of rituals

all of these permanent markers are more prevalent when external warfare is present in a society than when it is not; only tattooing is not significant.

ritual activity that does not leave a permanent visible result: body and face painting, ingestion of toxic substances, and periods of isolation. Fig. 5 shows that all of these nonpermanent markers are more prevalent in societies that engage in internal warfare only than in those that do not.

Polygyny:
Polygynous societies have costlier male rites than non-
polygynous societies (F1,60=6.01, p=.017) and nonstrati- fied societies have costlier male rites than stratified societies (F1,60=6.85, p=.011).

While polygynous groups exhibit costlier rites than nonpolygynous groups, this relationship is not significant when subsistence type or warfare frequency is included in the model, suggesting that male rites do not vary as a function of mating competition.

Discussion:

Ember and Ember (1992) have shown that warfare frequency is a predictor of polygyny. Nonetheless, warfare frequency remains a significant predictor of the costliness of male rites (F1,47=5.24, p=.027)

Among nonpolygynous socie- ties, high levels of warfare are also associated with costlier rites, but this difference is not significant (average costliness rating 7.5 vs. 4.1; n=13, t=1.75, p=.12)

Societies such as nation-states and chiefdoms, which tend to have large community sizes, can coerce participation in warfare or other collective activities through legitimate punishment threats (e.g., fines, imprisonment). Thus, contrary to our original prediction, these communities may be less dependent on ritual signs of commitment than small egalitarian societies because they can effectively punish defectors.

results do not demonstrate that costly male rites genuinely signal the group commitments of individuals. As Maynard Smith and Harper (2003) explain, for a signal to classify as a Zahavian handicap the net benefits for displaying the signal must be higher for a high-quality individual (in our case, someone strongly committed to the group) than a low-quality individual (someone weakly committed to the group)

Indeed, given the rigorous standards of evidence needed, with the exception of several foraging studies (Bliege Bird, Smith, {\&} Bird, 2001; Smith, Bliege Bird, {\&} Bird, 2003), few costly signals have been convincingly demonstrated in the human evolutionary literature.

imprudent to assume that one causal variable is responsible for a set of behaviors as complex as male rituals:

For example, scars and paint may serve to make their bearers look fierce or, alternatively, they may help distinguish friends from foes on the battlefield

solidarity achieved through ritual actions may also impact other collective endeavors:

Likewise, although our results did not support the hypothesis that costly male rites serve to signal mate quality, male rites may be one of the many arenas in which females evaluate males even if this is not their main function

During the ear piercing ceremony boys must remain motionless and show no pain, or they will be publicly shamed, thus reducing their mating prospects.

Gilmore (1990) describes how women regard males who failed to correctly perform rigorous initiation rites as unsuitable mates, whereas men consider such individuals to be unreliable and untrustworthy. 

examples suggest that coerced initiations might have different signaling value than those which are willingly performed, or at least correctly performed, even if begrudgingly.

In many boyhood rituals, such as subincision or circumcision, since the father (or male kin) rather than the boy is the signaler, expressions of pain are often tolerated and even expected (Paige {\&} Paige, 1981). 

Moreover, once a marker exists, opportunity costs for out- group activities increase, thus enhancing the signal value of the marker (Iannaccone, 1992).

Flipping the hypothesis around: violent male rites lead to warfare!

rather than a mechanism to create male solidarity, ritual violence during childhood produces violent men, and one manifes- tation of this violence is warfare. In several cross-cultural studies, Chick and colleagues (Chick {\&} Loy, 2001; Chick, Loy, {\&} Miracle, 1997) found an association between socialization for aggressiveness and warfare frequency, although no causal relationship could be determined in these studies either (also see Ember {\&} Ember, 1994)

exploring whether ritual costs are correlated with the frequency of male intra-group violence against women or other men, as would be expected if ritual violence causes boys to become aggressive men.

why are male rites so violent and traumatic? 

Signaling theory may explain variation in ritual costs, but it cannot explain how the specific form of ritual costs varies across environments. Many rituals entail high energetic and material costs (dancing, charity, etc.), but most of the male rites considered here are physically dangerous and painful

This is interesting here as it runs counter to the wisdom in Chi},

cognitive content biases (mental representations of gods)
cultural evolutionary models (committment and belief)

Cognitive by-product view of religion: we do not have a mind for religion; rather, religion has evolved culturally to fit the minds we have

one common argument (e.g., Barrett [2004]; Pyysi{\"{a}}inen and Hauser [2010]) is that religious beliefs arise naturally and effortlessly from the biases and tendencies of the human mind, with minimal or no need for extensive cultural scaffolding.

the cognitive tendencies and intuitions that bias the human mind towards religiosity and constrain the range of possible religious intuitions across cultures (e.g., Atran and Norenzayan [2004]; Barrett [2000]; Henrich [2009]; Kirkpatrick [1999]; Pyysi{\"{a}}inen and Antonnen [2002])

unanswered questions about the key distinction between mentally representing supernatural concepts as opposed to believing in them.

scientists need to explain the psychological difference between supernatural beliefs that are men- tally represented but treated as fictional (fairies in folk tales, the gods of other reli- gions), and those that are mentally represented and evoke deep worship and commitment (the gods of one's own group)

VISCERAL BELIEF

The distinction between mental represen- tation and belief-commitment is crucial to explain cultural differences in the degree of religious commitment around the world, the existence of disbelief, and

We thus explain why a supernatural agent with identical content and supported by exactly the same cognitive biases can in one place or time be an idol of immense devotion, while in a different time or place can be merely myth or fanciful tale: this is the so-called ‘Zeus Problem' (Gervais and Henrich 2010).

The Evolution of Cultural Learning:
Naive cultural learner is faced with the question of what to believe about a new environment.

Although social learning can be found in many animal species (e.g., Whiten [2005]), humans rely upon each other for adaptive information to an unparalleled degree in the animal kingdom.

As a consequence, our species is addicted to culture, and the vast bulk of preferences, motivations, attitudes and beliefs are – or can be – influenced by transmission from other members of their social group (Henrich and McElreath 2003).

Because humans depend on others for information, they must be sensitive to the quality of the information they acquire from different sources.

Two psychological mechanisms: 
1. Representational content biases (fitness relevant information)
2. Context biases (model-based learning biases)

CONTENT:
Some types of information are easier to remember, more emotionally evocative (fitness relevant), or allow more potent inferences to be made about the surrounding world.

Concepts supported by these content biases would hold privileged status in cultural transmission.

CONTEXT: 
If a na{\"{i}}ve cultural learner places weight on the prevalence of a certain belief (say, by noticing that most people gather nuts rather than mushrooms), that learner is utilizing a 1. conformist learning bias (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and Boyd 1998; Kendal, Giraldaeu and Laland 2009). A second strategy is to preferentially imitate cultural models who are older, skilled, prestigious and successful (e.g., Gil-White and Henrich [2001]): 2. prestige-based learning bias.

3. CRED: credibility-enhancing display (CRED) of the model's underlying beliefs regarding mushrooms (Henrich 2009)

Belief in social information is dependent on a little bit of information already embodied: cultural learning, snug fit


DEVELOPMENTAL STORY: Learning biases emerge at the same time as ToM; Language; reading intentions. 

The capacities for context-dependent learning emerge early in development

Three- and four-year-old children are more likely to believe information that comes from sources who have proven to be reliable; they prefer sources with a track record of accuracy (e.g., Koenig and Harris [2005]; Koenig, Cl{\'{e}}ment and Harris [2004]; Pasquini et al. [2007])

Children as young as four preferentially believe infor- mation from sources who claim certainty (Sabbagh and Baldwin 2001).

Recent work shows that young children readily track the visual attention of others (a ‘prestige cue') and selectively learn from those who were previously preferentially attended to, even under novel circumstances and in the absence of observers (Chudek et al. 2010).

NEXT: CONTENTxCONTEXT 
content and context biases interact to affect the spread of
certain kinds of religious beliefs

CONTENT: content biases make some concepts inherently more interesting, memorable and transmittable (congtagious)
love, spirit, the maternal, 

CONTEXT: efficacy, reality:
victory! results!


We argue that content biases affect the potential of a concept to become memorable and contagious, but people will only come to believe in those salient concepts that are supported by appropriate context biases that allow people to selectively acquire cultural information

CONTENT BIASES: Counterintuition?
cultural learners should be more likely to pay attention to, store and transmit representations when these are judged more: 

(1) potentially actionable; inferencial potential (Boyer 2001)

Representations, for example, in which the causes of unpleasant circumstances (e.g., storms or illnesses) are random with respect to the actions of those afflicted do not lead to useful or helpful inferences or actions, and thus are not easy to maintain
Instead, representations that involve believing that illnesses are caused by the jealously of others (e.g., the ‘evil eye') can lead to inferences about whomight be causing a particular illness and how one can avoid such illnesses in the future

(2) fitness relevant and thus emotionally evocative;
People should tend to devote more cognitive resources to stimuli that evoke affective reactions such as disgust, fear, etc., potentially leading to biases in cultural evolution (e.g., Boyer and Lienard [2006]).


(3) plausible or compatible:
Some expectations rely heavily on our reliably developing intuitions, including core cognitive processes related to such domains as mechanics and biology (Spelke and Kinzler 2007)

FLOW: works with our folk intuitions about physics and biology: intuitive mechanics around movement

For example, representations from modern physics, which involve objects (e.g., electrons) that exist only probabilisticallyat any point in space, radicallyviolate our intuitive expectations fromfolkmechanics and thus do not readily transmit

Having acquired a particular idea via cultural transmission, a learner may be more likely to acquire another idea, because the two ‘fit together' in some cognitive or psychological sense.

Counter-intuitive concepts violate our core assumption about the nature of things in the world; usually these assumptions focus on inten- tional beings, animals, inanimate objects or events (expectations often associated with the cognition domains of folkphysics, folkpsychology and folkbiology)

By departing systematically, but mildly, from established cognitive rules we use to understand and organize information in our environment, they achieve greater memorability

From the perspective just presented, many counter-intuitive concepts probably create complex mixtures of plausibility, applicability and emotional evocativeness.

Minimal counterintuitiveness of FLOW? Doing things the body is not supposed to do?

As Sperber (1996: 73) has put it, these minimal counterintuitions are ‘relevant mysteries,' in the sense that they are closely con- nected to background knowledge, but do not admit to a final interpretation.

However, it is a far step from memorability and mental represen- tation to sincere belief in and passionate commitment to religious concepts.

Why do Christians passionately believe in Jesus but not in Shiva (or vice versa for Hindus)?Andwhy is it that Zeus, who has all the cognitive elements necessary to be a successful god, has lost his spell and is no longer aworshipped deity? 

However, we are skeptical that content biases alone can solve the aforementioned puzzles. (For a detailed critique, see Gervais and Henrich [2010]).

Cultural learners are not mere passive receptacles who believe in and commit to any concept that is memorable and widespread. (See Bergstrom, Mehlmann and Boyer [2006] for a similar point)

Indeed, there are good reasons to suspect skepticism or epistemic vigilance (Sperber et al. 2010) on behalf of cultural learners, even in children.

Mead's (1932) classic study of animism on the island of Manus in New Guinea revealed that children do not readily commit to and believe in the counterintuitive concepts they hear expressed by adults.

Although controversy surrounds Mead's work, similar patterns emerge from laboratory experiments that generally show that chil- dren are more inclined to believe in intuitive concepts over counterintuitive concepts (Harris and Koenig 2006; Harris et al. 2006).

This resistance to belief in counterintuitive concepts persists into adulthood. 

In a variety of domains, children and adults alike have a hard time believing in concepts that violate intuitive expectations about the world.

content biases make some counterintuitive concepts memorable and, therefore, widespread. However, cultural learners are easily able to remember, represent and reason about concepts without necessarily believing in them.

This skepticism of counterintuitive concepts poses a serious challenge for any model of religion that relies exclusively upon representational content biases, as the very same feature (minimal counterintuitiveness) Content biases therefore appear better able to explain why folktales and myths – that is, stories containing some counterintuitive elements that people do not actually believe to be true – are widespread and memorable than they are able to explain the fact that around the world most people who have ever lived sincerely believe in and commit to only the small subset of counterintuitive supernatural agents popularly endorsed within their own cultural context

Content biases make supernatural concepts interesting, memorable and contagious, but context biases explain why people come to believe in a particular subset of the supernatural concepts to which people are exposed (Atran and Henrich 2010; Gervais and Henrich 2010). 

Religion 397
(McKloskey, Caramazza and Green 1980) Johns Hopkins undergraduates – manyof whom had taken college physics – were asked to predict the trajectories of objects leaving curved tubes. Consistent with folk physics, and inconsistent with actual physics, most participants guessed that the balls would have curved trajectories. In a variety of domains, children and adults alike have a hard time believing in concepts that violate intuitive expectations about the world. In sum, content biases make some counterintuitive concepts memorable and, therefore, widespread. However, cultural learners are easily able to remember, represent and reason about concepts without necessarily believing in them. Fur- thermore, some evidence suggests that people actually resist belief in concepts that routinely violate intuitive expectations. This skepticism of counterintuitive concepts poses a serious challenge for any model of religion that relies exclusively upon representational content biases, as the very same feature (minimal counterin- tuitiveness) that has been argued to cause religious concepts to spread and persist in cultures may also make the concepts less believable. Content biases therefore appear better able to explain why folktales and myths – that is, stories containing some counterintuitive elements that people do not actually believe to be true – are widespread and memorable than they are able to explain the fact that around the world most people who have ever lived sincerely believe in and commit to only the small subset of counterintuitive supernatural agents popularly endorsed within their own cultural context.


Religious faith in cultural context
Most people adopt the religious beliefs of their parents and surrounding communities, rather than coming to believe in everymem- orable or attention-grabbing supernatural agent to which they are exposed.

Furthermore, most religions give believers ample opportunity to exhibit credibility-enhancing displays of their fealty to a given god – public prayer, painful rites of passage, martyrdom – that will further ratchet up belief in cultural learners.

that supernatural concepts have predictable cognitive structure that make them memorable and contagious, but people come to believe only in the narrow subset of those supernatural concepts supported by context biases and credibility enhancing displays within their immediate social context.

This ‘promiscuous teleology' has been argued to indicate that viewing nature as inherently intentional is a default cognitive position.

there appears to be a lot of room for context biases in cultural learning to shape people's beliefs about the origins of species, and adults' predomi- nant creationist beliefs (in many parts of the world) may have as much to do with what they are explicitly or implicitly taught in a religious context – and what they are not taught well in an academic context – as with what they find intuitively compelling.

Children's reasoning about death：
entails belief in agents with psychological properties, but lacking physical bodies. That is, belief in the afterlife may be a minimally coun- terintuitive belief that people adopt automatically, without needing context biases to override the unbelievability of this counterintuitive claim.

Bering and Bjorklund (2004) investigated children's intuitions about death and the afterlife in a simple series of experiments. 

Children reliably reported that normal biological functions ceased after death, but psychological traits persisted. This trend was particularly pronounced among younger children, leading the authors to conclude that children innately believe in an afterlife.

Bering (2006) further elaborated this argument, proposing that afterlife beliefs
are a naturally selected evolutionary adaptation. In this view, beliefs in an afterlife are the cognitive default; they are present in early childhood.

Bering's findings contrast starkly with those of Harris and Giminez (2005)：
Unlike Bering and Bjorklund (2004), these authors found that older, rather than younger, children were more likely to endorse a psychological afterlife（for death of a grandparent rather than a fictional mouse).

This was especially likely when the death was framed in religious terms, implying that children readily (and perhaps initially) adopt a strictly biological conception of death, but that they can successfully recount a religious conception of death, replete with psychological immortality, only after some religious teaching and when the problem is framed in religious terms.

afterlife beliefs may not be the default, but rather a separate narrative style about death that is elaborated through explicit religious teaching.

Astuti and Harris (2008): They compared both adults and children in a village in Madagascar, by asking a series of questions after describing a death in either religious or secular contexts.

Adults and older children reliably stated that both physical and mental processes ceased at death, unless asked in a religious context

In a detailed follow-up with only children, the youngest participants (under five years old) did not demonstrate reliable patterns in their conception of death. Older children typically stated that both mental and physical processes ended at death.

Taken together, these results pose a serious challenge to the claim that afterlife beliefs rep- resent a default position, but rather that afterlife beliefs are the reliable products of religious instruction.

Atheism2: the cultural transmission of (dis)belief

Boyer (2008: 1039) argues that ‘some form of religious thinking seems to be the path of least resistance for our cognitive systems. By contrast, disbelief is generally the result of deliberate, effortful work against our natural cognitive dispositions – hardly the easiest ideology to propagate.'

Barrett (2004: 108) claims that ‘being an atheist is not easy {\ldots} As odd as it sounds, it isn't natural to reject all supernatural agents.'

Bloom (2007: 148) contrasts the claims of self-described atheists with the view that ‘people every- where naturally have some tacit supernatural beliefs; these arise in children regard- less of the culture.'

This perspective raises three possibilities:
1. it predicts that atheism should be unusual, only occurring in rare and improbable situations worldwide.

2. it predicts that atheism is only ‘skin deep,' and that avowed atheists might retain some implicit theism (e.g., Bering [in press]; see also Slingerland [2008]).

3. even if atheism exists at the implicit level, it might only arise when people reflectively override theistic intuitions (Barrett 2004).

1. Is atheism a rare abberation? 
Around the globe, there is a trend towards secularization likely driven by economic and existential security, although, because of low birthrates of secularized societies, levels of religiosity remain stable in the world overall (Norris and Inglehart 2004). Thus a substantial number of people claim to be atheists, even though atheists are among the least trusted groups of people in the world 

2. Although there is a surprising dearth of research directly examining the beliefs or intuitions of atheists, it is poss- ible to approach the subject indirectly, by examining whether even avowed atheists react similarly to believers when given subtle, implicit experimental religious prods. 

participants felt less responsible for making the words disappearwhen primed with ‘God'during the task. Importantly, this effect was entirely driven by religious believers. Nonbelievers were unaffected by even subliminal God primes, suggesting that atheists are indeed atheists, even on an implicit level.

This result is similar to one other priming study in which implicit God primes increased generosity among believers but had no effect on nonbelievers (Shariff and Norenzayan 2007)

To the extent that atheists are uninfluenced by implicit religious primes, we can conclude that cultural learning of religion, which is absent among at least some atheists who were never exposed to religion, plays a role in religious beliefs.

Finally, is atheism more cognitively effortful than belief? If religion arises natu-
rally, then atheists might be able to sustain their disbelief only through the contin- ual exertion of cognitive effort, in the sameway that physicists can study subatomic particles through the continual exertion of cognitive effort to override natural, yet faulty, intuitions about the world.

This claim has not to date been rigorously tested, but available circumstantial evidence indicates that atheism might not be effortful among individuals whowere never exposed to context-based cues that one should adopt religious belief. 

This is because there likely are multiple psychological paths to atheism, including both cognitively effortful religious deconversion and simply growing in the absence of context- based cues supporting supernatural-agent beliefs. 

Indigenous atheists, by cultural environment (free from explicit religious CREDs), do not need to exert huge cognitive effort.

If a learner grows up around religious models, he is likely to become religious. If, on the other hand, a learner who grows up around people who do not hold religious beliefs– or people who do not exhibit credibility-enhancing displays of their underlying religious beliefs –will come to not hold religious beliefs, even if some natural intui- tions, however weakly or strongly,might enable people to easily mentally represent supernatural agents.

Lanman (2009; submitted) studied the role of credibility-enhancing displays of religious conviction in the decline of religiosity in Scandinavia.

Even among children raised by parents who themselves believed in God, kids who did not see credibility- enhancing displays of their parents' faith (by, for example, observing them engage in religious rituals), grew up to be nonbelievers.

Moving Forward:
The cognitive science of religion has anchored the study of religion in up-to-date scientific explanations of human cognitive architecture (Boyer 2003). 

‘naturalizing religion,' offering a viable program that can demonstrate how well-understood natural cognitive predispositions statistically shape and constrain the mental representation and cultural distribution of religious beliefs and behaviors in populations of minds.

In four experiments (N = 883) spanning two cultures and two status groups within one of those cultures, we obtained new evidence that implicit intergroup attitudes emerge in young children in a form indistinguishable from adult attitudes. Strikingly, this invariance from childhood to adulthood holds for members of socially dominant majorities, who consistently favor their in-group, as well as for members of a disadvantaged minority, who, from the early moments of race-based categorization, do not show a preference for their in-group. Far from requiring a protracted period of internalization, implicit intergroup attitudes are characterized by early enculturation and developmental invariance.},

abstract = {The influence of culture on cognitive development is well established for school age and older children. But almost nothing is known about how different parenting and socialization practices in different cultures affect infants' and young children's earliest emerging cognitive and social-cognitive skills. In the current monograph, we report a series of eight studies in which we systematically assessed the social-cognitive skills of 1- to 3-year-old children in three diverse cultural settings. One group of children was from a Western, middle-class cultural setting in rural Canada and the other two groups were from traditional, small-scale cultural settings in rural Peru and India.In a first group of studies, we assessed 1-year-old children's most basic social-cognitive skills for understanding the intentions and attention of others: imitation, helping, gaze following, and communicative pointing.Children's performance in these tasks was mostly similar across cultural settings. In a second group of studies, we assessed 1-year-old children's skills in participating in interactive episodes of collaboration and joint attention.Again in these studies the general finding was one of cross-cultural similarity. In a final pair of studies, we assessed 2- to 3-year-old children's skills within two symbolic systems (pretense and pictorial). Here we found that the Canadian children who had much more experience with such symbols showed skills at an earlier age.Our overall conclusion is that young children in all cultural settings get sufficient amounts of the right kinds of social experience to develop their most basic social-cognitive skills for interacting with others and participating in culture at around the same age. In contrast, children's acquisition of more culturally specific skills for use in practices involving artifacts and symbols is more dependent on specific learning experiences.},

abstract = {The application of evolutionary theory to understanding the origins of our species' capacities for social learning has generated key insights into cultural evolution. By focusing on how our psychology has evolved to adaptively extract beliefs and practices by observing others, theorists have hypothesized how social learning can, over generations, give rise to culturally evolved adaptations. While much field research documents the subtle ways in which culturally transmitted beliefs and practices adapt people to their local environments, and much experimental work reveals the predicted patterns of social learning, little research connects real-world adaptive cultural traits to the patterns of transmission predicted by these theories. Addressing this gap, we show how food taboos for pregnant and lactating women in Fiji selectively target the most toxic marine species, effectively reducing a woman's chances of fish poisoning by 30 per cent during pregnancy and 60 per cent during breastfeeding. We further analyse how these taboos are transmitted, showing support for cultural evolutionary models that combine familial transmission with selective learning from locally prestigious individuals. In addition, we explore how particular aspects of human cognitive processes increase the frequency of some non-adaptive taboos. This case demonstrates how evolutionary theory can be deployed to explain both adaptive and non-adaptive behavioural patterns.},

We discuss the eclipse of behavior in personality and social psychology, in which direct obser- vation of behavior has been increasingly supplanted by introspective self-reports, hypothetical scenarios, and questionnaire ratings.

In the present study, we examined the usefulness of 3-D methods of analysis for establishing the presence of dynamical systems properties, such as phase transitions and symmetry-breaking processes in the team sport of rugby. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed to reconstruct the 3-D performance space in a typical one-versus-one subphase of rugby. Results confirm that ANNs are reliable tools for reconstructing a 3-D performance space and may be instrumental in identifying pattern formation in team sports generally.},

a symmetry-breaking process had occurred in successful dribbling when there was an abrupt change in the shape of the curve describing the interpersonal distance of each attacker–defender dyad

Rugby:
During a successful run by the attacker, the initial state of order of the dyad (e.g., a positional balance between attacker and defender) is annihilated or sustained by information fields. A new state of order emerges in this dynamical system during a phase transition.

Consequently, although Ara{\'{u}}jo et al. (2004; Ara{\'{u}}jo et al., 2002) could observe phase transitions in interper- sonal coordination dynamics only in the horizontal plane, symmetry-breaking processes might also be observable in the vertical plane.},

This article reviews recent evidence suggesting that psychological essentialism is an early cognitive bias. Young children look beyond the obvious in many converging ways: when learning words, generalizing knowledge to new category members, reasoning about the insides of things, contemplating the role of nature versus nurture, and constructing causal explanations. These findings argue against the standard view of children as concrete thinkers, instead claiming that children have an early tendency to search for hidden, non-obvious features.},

Study 1 revealed that while children drew inferences mostly by social category, adults did it by personality trait. Study 2 showed that the children's pattern was not due to how the categorical information was conveyed. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that for kindergarteners, labels, not appearances, are determinant of the inductive potential of social categories. Studies indicated that "Jew" and "Arab" were the most inductively powerful social categories for both children and adults. The results carry implications for the roles of language, appearances, and culture in the conceptualization of "human kinds."},

Moreover, the core strengths of behavioural ecology, including the use of simple adaptive models to investigate complex biological phenomena, have now been applied to new puzzles outside behaviour. But this strategy comes at a cost. Replication across studies is rare and there have been few tests of the underlying genetic assumptions of adaptive models. Here, I attempt to identify the key outstanding questions in behavioural ecology and suggest that researchers must make greater use of model organisms and evolutionary genetics in order to make substantial progress on these topics.},

However, the nature of this relationship remains unresolved. Does language promote false-belief understanding, or does it merely facilitate development that could occur independently, albeit on a delayed timescale? We examined language development and false-belief understanding in deaf learners of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua. The use of mental-state vocabulary and performance on a low-verbal false-belief task were assessed, over 2 years, in adult and adolescent users of Nicaraguan Sign Language. Results show that those adults who acquired a nascent form of the language during childhood produce few mental-state signs and fail to exhibit false-belief understanding. Furthermore, those whose language developed over the period of the study correspondingly developed in false-belief understanding. Thus, language learning, over and above social experience, drives the development of a mature theory of mind.},

abstract = {People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cul- tures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of indi- viduals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interde- pendence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motiva- tion; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that humans have neurological specializations for music processing, but a compelling adaptationist account of music and dance is lacking. The sexual selection hypothesis cannot easily account for the widespread performance of music and dance in groups (especially synchronized performances), and the social bonding hypothesis has severe theoretical difficulties. Humans are unique among the primates in their ability to form cooperative alliances between groups in the absence of consanguineal ties. We propose that this unique form of social organization is predicated on music and dance. Music and dance may have evolved as a coalition signaling system that could, among other things, credibly communicate coalition quality, thus permitting meaningful cooperative relationships between groups. This capability may have evolved from coordinated territorial defense signals that are common in many social species, including chimpanzees. We present a study in which manipulation of music synchrony significantly altered subjects' perceptions of music quality, and in which subjects' perceptions of music quality were correlated with their perceptions of coalition quality, supporting our hypothesis. Our hypothesis also has implications for the evolution of psychological mechanisms underlying cultural production in other domains such as food preparation, clothing and body decoration, storytelling and ritual, and tools and other artifacts.},

Learning a language, then, is simply a matter of finding out what the local clothing is for universal concepts we already have (Li {\&} Gleitman 2002)

Four studies investigated the circumstances under which toddlers would trust testimony that conflicted with their expectations about the physical world. Thirty-month-olds believed testimony that conflicted with a naive bias (Study 1), and they also repeatedly trusted testimony that conflicted with an event they had just seen (Study 2)-even when they had an incentive to ignore the testimony (Study 3). Children responded more skeptically if they could see that the testimony was wrong as it was being delivered (Study 3), or if they had the opportunity to accumulate evidence confirming their initial belief before hearing someone contradict it (Study 4). Together, these studies demonstrate that toddlers have a robust bias to trust even surprising testimony, but this trust can be influenced by how much confidence they have in their initial belief.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine how English and Mandarin speakers think about time, and we test how the patterns of thinking in the two groups relate to patterns in linguistic and cultural experience. In Mandarin, vertical spatial metaphors are used more frequently to talk about time than they are in English; English relies primarily on horizontal terms. We present results from two tasks comparing English and Mandarin speakers' temporal reasoning. The tasks measure how people spatialize time in three-dimensional space, including the sagittal (front/back), transverse (left/right), and vertical (up/down) axes. Results of Experiment 1 show that people automatically create spatial representations in the course of temporal reasoning, and these implicit spatializations differ in accordance with patterns in language, even in a non-linguistic task. Both groups showed evidence of a left-to-right representation of time, in accordance with writing direction, but only Mandarin speakers showed a vertical top-to-bottom pattern for time (congruent with vertical spatiotemporal metaphors in Mandarin). Results of Experiment 2 confirm and extend these findings, showing that bilinguals' representations of time depend on both long-term and proximal aspects of language experience. Participants who were more proficient in Mandarin were more likely to arrange time vertically (an effect of previous language experience). Further, bilinguals were more likely to arrange time vertically when they were tested in Mandarin than when they were tested in English (an effect of immediate linguistic context).},

abstract = {Fifty years ago, Ernst Mayr published a hugely influential paper on the nature of causation in biology, in which he distinguished between proximate and ultimate causes. Mayr equated proximate causation with immediate factors (for example, physiology) and ultimate causation with evolutionary explanations (for example, natural selection). He argued that proximate and ultimate causes addressed different questions and were not alternatives. Mayr's account of causation remains widely accepted today, with both positive and negative ramifications. Several current debates in biology (for example, over evolution and development, niche construction, cooperation, and the evolution of language) are linked by a common axis of acceptance/rejection of Mayr's model of causation. We argue that Mayr's formulation has acted to stabilize the dominant evolutionary paradigm against change but may now hamper progress in the biological sciences.},

Mayr's (1961) distinction between proximate mechanisms and ultimate causes, although useful for answering the "how" and "why" questions separately,  does not provide room for an accurate account of development, and the fact that developmental (proximate) mechanisms can interact with ultimate causes, in a way that causation is reciprocal.  The peacock's tail is an example of this (intersexual selection), as is habitat and social co-evolution.
        
Mayr's distinction assumes a constancy of development and environment, and promotes the understanding that phenotypic expression/variation has nothing to do with ultimate expalanations.

abstract = {Although Darwin insisted that human intelligence could be fully explained by the theory of evolution, the codiscoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that abstract intelligence was of no use to ancestral humans and could only be explained by intelligent design. Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the "cognitive niche." This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.},

1. Contrast Pinker's cognitive niche with Tomasello's shared-intentionality (2005). 
        
2.  Is the study of what makes humans cognitively distinct (shared-intentionality and metaphoric abstraction etc) distract us away from a realisation of the other processes of social cognition? 
        
This involves trying to sanction off culture from its ecological niche (Laland {\&} Hoppitt 2003).  What about the cultural forms that are distributed in socio-technical environments and indeed the fact that many of the abstract processes of human culture/cognition are shaped by specific ecologies (cultural diversity)?  (Roepstorff 2010, Kirsch 2006).

@article{Whiten2012,
abstract = {Hominin evolution took a remarkable pathway, as the foraging strategy extended to large mammalian prey already hunted by a guild of specialist carnivores. How was this possible for a moderately sized ape lacking the formidable anatomical adaptations of these competing 'professional hunters'? The long-standing answer that this was achieved through the elaboration of a new 'cognitive niche' reliant on intelligence and technology is compelling, yet insufficient. Here we present evidence from a diversity of sources supporting the hypothesis that a fuller answer lies in the evolution of a new socio-cognitive niche, the principal components of which include forms of cooperation, egalitarianism, mindreading (also known as 'theory of mind'), language and cultural transmission, that go far beyond the most comparable phenomena in other primates. This cognitive and behavioural complex allows a human hunter-gatherer band to function as a unique and highly competitive predatory organism. Each of these core components of the socio-cognitive niche is distinctive to humans, but primate research has increasingly identified related capacities that permit inferences about significant ancestral cognitive foundations to the five pillars of the human social cognitive niche listed earlier. The principal focus of the present study was to review and integrate this range of recent comparative discoveries.},

abstract = {Some researchers have claimed that chimpanzee and human culture rest on homologous cognitive and learning mechanisms. While clearly there are some homologous mechanisms, we argue here that there are some different mechanisms at work as well. Chimpanzee cultural traditions represent behavioural biases of different populations, all within the species' existing cognitive repertoire (what we call the 'zone of latent solutions') that are generated by founder effects, individual learning and mostly product-oriented (rather than process-oriented) copying. Human culture, in contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over time (what we call the 'ratchet effect'). This difference results from the facts that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans' unique form of cumulative cultural evolution.},

@article{Heyes2012,
abstract = {Cumulative cultural evolution is what 'makes us odd'; our capacity to learn facts and techniques from others, and to refine them over generations, plays a major role in making human minds and lives radically different from those of other animals. In this article, I discuss cognitive processes that are known collectively as 'cultural learning' because they enable cumulative cultural evolution. These cognitive processes include reading, social learning, imitation, teaching, social motivation and theory of mind. Taking the first of these three types of cultural learning as examples, I ask whether and to what extent these cognitive processes have been adapted genetically or culturally to enable cumulative cultural evolution. I find that recent empirical work in comparative psychology, developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience provides surprisingly little evidence of genetic adaptation, and ample evidence of cultural adaptation. This raises the possibility that it is not only 'grist' but also 'mills' that are culturally inherited; through social interaction in the course of development, we not only acquire facts about the world and how to deal with it (grist), we also build the cognitive processes that make 'fact inheritance' possible (mills).},

@article{Csibra2011a,
abstract = {We propose that the cognitive mechanisms that enable the transmission of cultural knowledge by communication between individuals constitute a system of 'natural pedagogy' in humans, and represent an evolutionary adaptation along the hominin lineage. We discuss three kinds of arguments that support this hypothesis. First, natural pedagogy is likely to be human-specific: while social learning and communication are both widespread in non-human animals, we know of no example of social learning by communication in any other species apart from humans. Second, natural pedagogy is universal: despite the huge variability in child-rearing practices, all human cultures rely on communication to transmit to novices a variety of different types of cultural knowledge, including information about artefact kinds, conventional behaviours, arbitrary referential symbols, cognitively opaque skills and know-how embedded in means-end actions. Third, the data available on early hominin technological culture are more compatible with the assumption that natural pedagogy was an independently selected adaptive cognitive system than considering it as a by-product of some other human-specific adaptation, such as language. By providing a qualitatively new type of social learning mechanism, natural pedagogy is not only the product but also one of the sources of the rich cultural heritage of our species.},

@article{Claidiere2012,
abstract = {Conformity--defined here by the fact that an individual displays a particular behavior because it is the most frequent the individual witnessed in others--has long been recognized by social psychologists as one of the main categories of social influence. Surprisingly, it is only recently that conformity has become an active topic in animal and comparative biology. As in any new and rapidly growing field, however, definitions, hypotheses, and protocols are diverse, not easy to organize in a coherent way, and sometimes seriously in conflict with one another. Here we pursue greater coherence by reviewing the newer literature on conformity in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology in light of the foundational work in social psychology. We suggest that the knowledge accumulated in social psychology can be exploited by behavioral ecologists and evolutionary biologists to bring conceptual clarity to the field, avoid some experimental pitfalls, and help design new and challenging experiments. In particular, we propose that the notions of informational and normative conformity that, until now, have been little recognized in recent literature can resolve some important controversies. In turn, research on animal culture should be of great interest to social scientists, because understanding human culture and human uniqueness requires an evolutionary analysis of our cognitive capacities and their evolutionary origins. Our review suggests excellent opportunities for social and natural scientists to join forces in building an interdisciplinary and integrative approach to the pervasive phenomenon of conformity.},

abstract = {Cumulative cultural evolution has been suggested to account for key cognitive and behavioral attributes that distinguish modern humans from their anatomically similar ancestors, but researchers have yet to establish which cognitive mechanisms are responsible for this kind of learning and whether they are unique to humans. Here, we show that human participants' cumulative learning is not always reliant on sources of social information commonly assumed to be essential. Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching. Each condition was independently sufficient for participants to show cumulative learning. Because emulative learning can elicit cumulative culture on this task, we conclude that accounts of the unusual complexity of human culture in terms of species-unique learning mechanisms do not currently provide complete explanations and that other factors may be involved.},

Using this approach, we present three models with three new theoretical results. (1) Multi-layered networks are optimal for groups that face costs associated with maintaining relationships among the members, combined with costs associated with information flows. (2) The presence of a social hierarchy can be an adaptive feature of the community: the steeper the optimal social hierarchy is, the fewer relationships group members need to have. (3) Falling communication costs lead to a less steep optimal social hierarchy in communities in which socially useful information is evenly distributed, but to an even steeper social hierarchy in groups in which socially useful information is uneven. Thus we show how, when communication is costly, cooperation can give rise to communities that are socially highly structured.},

abstract = {People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cul- tures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of indi- viduals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interde- pendence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motiva- tion; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation.},

abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these "standard subjects" are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

abstract = {Evolutionary developmental psychology involves the expression of evolved, epigenetic programs, as described by the developmental systems approach, over the course of ontogeny. There have been different selection pressures on organisms at different times in ontogeny, and some characteristics of infants and children were selected in evolution to serve an adaptive function at that time in their life history rather than to prepare individuals for later adulthood. Examples of such adaptive functions of immaturity are provided from infancy, play, and cognitive development. Most evolved psychological mechanisms are proposed to be domain specific in nature and have been identified for various aspects of children's cognitive and social development, most notably for the acquisition of language and for theory of mind. Differences in the quality and quantity of parental investment affect children's development and influence their subsequent reproductive and childcare strategies. Some sex differences observed in childhood, particularly as expressed during play, are seen as antecedents and preparations for adult sex differences. Because evolved mechanisms were adaptive to ancestral environments, they are not always adaptive for contemporary people, and this mismatch of evolved mechanisms with modern environments is seen in children's maladjustment to some aspects of formal schooling. We argue that an evolutionary perspective can be valuable for developing a better understanding of human ontogeny in contemporary society and that a developmental perspective is important for a better understanding of evolutionary psychology.},

abstract = {In spite of the remarkable progress made in the burgeoning field of social neuroscience, the neural mechanisms that underlie social encounters are only beginning to be studied and could - paradoxically - be seen as representing the "dark matter" of social neuroscience. Recent conceptual and empirical developments consistently indicate the need for investigations that allow the study of real-time social encounters in a truly interactive manner. This suggestion is based on the premise that social cognition is fundamentally different when we are in interaction with others rather than merely observing them. In this article, we outline the theoretical conception of a second-person approach to other minds and review evidence from neuroimaging, psychophysiological studies, and related fields to argue for the development of a second-person neuroscience, which will help neuroscience to really "go social"; this may also be relevant for our understanding of psychiatric disorders construed as disorders of social cognition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the last years, several motion analysis methods have been developed without considering representative contexts for sports performance. The purpose of this paper was to explain and underscore a straightforward method to measure human behavior in these contexts.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Procedures combining manual video tracking (with TACTO device) and bidimensional reconstruction (through direct linear transformation) using a single camera were used in order to capture kinematic data required to compute collective variable(s) and control parameter(s). These procedures were applied to a 1vs1 association football task as an illustrative subphase of team sports and will be presented in a tutorial fashion.

RESULTS: Preliminary analysis of distance and velocity data identified a collective variable (difference between the distance of the attacker and the defender to a target defensive area) and two nested control parameters (interpersonal distance and relative velocity).

CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated that the complementary use of TACTO software and direct linear transformation permit to capture and reconstruct complex human actions in their context in a low dimensional space (information reduction).},

However, the social (or communication) complexity hypothesis suggests that the kinds of information that can be acquired and processed may limit the size and/or complexity of social groups that a species can maintain. We use an agent-based model to test the hypothesis that the complexity of information processed influences the computational demands involved. We show that successive increases in the kinds of information processed allow organisms to break through the glass ceilings that otherwise limit the size of social groups: larger groups can only be achieved at the cost of more sophisticated kinds of information processing that are disadvantageous when optimal group size is small. These results simultaneously support both the social brain and the social complexity hypotheses.},

@article{Shamay-Tsoory2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans have a strong social tendency to compare themselves with others. We tend to feel envious when we receive less valuable rewards and may rejoice when our payoffs are more advantageous. Envy and schadenfreude (gloating over the other's misfortune) are social emotions widely agreed to be a symptom of the human social tendency to compare one's payoffs with those of others. Given the important social components of envy and gloating, we speculated that oxytocin may have a modulating effect on the intensity of these emotions.

METHODS: Fifty-six participants participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study. Following the administration of oxytocin or a placebo, participants played a game of chance with another (fake) participant who either won more money (envy manipulation), lost more money (schadenfreude manipulation), or won/lost equal amounts of money.

RESULTS: In comparison with the placebo, oxytocin increased the envy ratings during unequal monetary gain conditions involving relative loss (when the participant gained less money than another player). Oxytocin also increased the ratings of gloating during relative gain conditions (when the participant gained more money than the other player). By contrast, oxytocin had no effect on the emotional ratings following equal monetary gains nor did it affect general mood ratings.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the oxytocinergic system is involved in modulating envy and gloating. Thus, contrary to the prevailing belief that this system is involved solely in positive prosocial behaviors, it probably plays a key role in a wider range of social emotion-related behaviors.},

The aim of this review is to provide critical comment on the literature using an information-processing framework. We provide a summary of fundamental assumptions of information-processing models and highlight an impressive range of consistent findings that demonstrate the impact of oxytocin nasal spray on social information processing. These findings include that oxytocin nasal spray improves the early conceptual detection of affect from social cues and improves the accurate appraisal of affect from social cues at elaborate and strategic levels of processing. There is some evidence that these effects may be particularly powerful for positive social cues. This review comments on inconsistent results that have been reported. We argue that such inconsistencies can, in part, be explained by variability across experiments in the degree to which potential extraneous confounds have been controlled, the different methods upon which studies assessed cognition, and the extent to which the focus of investigation has been on group-based outcomes. Finally, we argue that sound cognitive experimental methods can provide powerful tools to identify markers of response to oxytocin nasal spray that can be integrated into more complex circuitry models. The identification of robust markers has particular value in predicting behavioral and therapeutic response to intervention. This should now be a major focus for future research. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Social Behavior.},

@article{Bartz2011,
abstract = {Building on animal research, the past decade has witnessed a surge of interest in the effects of oxytocin on social cognition and prosocial behavior in humans. This work has generated considerable excitement about identifying the neurochemical underpinnings of sociality in humans, and discovering compounds to treat social functioning deficits. Inspection of the literature, however, reveals that the effects of oxytocin in the social domain are often weak and/or inconsistent. We propose that this literature can be informed by an interactionist approach in which the effects of oxytocin are constrained by features of situations and/or individuals. We show how this approach can improve understanding of extant research, suggest novel mechanisms through which oxytocin might operate, and refine predictions about oxytocin pharmacotherapy.},

@article{Domes2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to "read the mind" of other individuals, that is, to infer their mental state by interpreting subtle social cues, is indispensable in human social interaction. The neuropeptide oxytocin plays a central role in social approach behavior in nonhuman mammals.

METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design, 30 healthy male volunteers were tested for their ability to infer the affective mental state of others using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) after intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin.

RESULTS: Oxytocin improved performance on the RMET compared with placebo. This effect was pronounced for difficult compared with easy items.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that oxytocin improves the ability to infer the mental state of others from social cues of the eye region. Oxytocin might play a role in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by severe social impairment.},

@article{Gordon2011,
abstract = {Humans are fundamentally social creatures who are ‘motivated' to be with others. In this review we examine the role of oxytocin (OT) as it relates to social motivation. OT is synthesized in the brain and throughout the body, including in the heart, thymus, gastrointestinal tract, as well as reproductive organs. The distribution of the OT receptor (OTR) system in both the brain and periphery is even more far-reaching and its expression is subject to changes over the course of development. OTR expression is also sensitive to changes in the external environment and the internal somatic world. The OT system functions as an important element within a complex, developmentally sensitive biobehavioral system. Other elements include sensory inputs, the salience, reward, and threat detection pathways, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress response axis. Despite an ever expanding scientific literature, key unresolved questions remain concerning the interplay of the central and peripheral components of this complex biobehavioral system that dynamically engages the brain and the body as humans interact with social partners over the course of development.},

@article{Feldman2012,
abstract = {A conceptual model detailing the process of bio-behavioral synchrony between the online physiological and behavioral responses of attachment partners during social contact is presented as a theoretical and empirical framework for the study of affiliative bonds. Guided by an ethological behavior-based approach, we suggest that micro-level social behaviors in the gaze, vocal, affective, and touch modalities are dynamically integrated with online physiological processes and hormonal response to create dyad-specific affiliations. Studies across multiple attachments throughout life are presented and demonstrate that the extended oxytocin (OT) system provides the neurohormonal substrate for parental, romantic, and filial attachment in humans; that the three prototypes of affiliation are expressed in similar constellations of social behavior; and that OT is stable over time within individuals, is mutually-influencing among partners, and that mechanisms of cross-generation and inter-couple transmission relate to coordinated social behavior. Research showing links between peripheral and genetic markers of OT with concurrent parenting and memories of parental care; between administration of OT to parent and infant's physiological readiness for social engagement; and between neuropeptides and the online synchrony of maternal and paternal brain response in social-cognitive and empathy networks support the hypothesis that human attachment develops within the matrix of biological attunement and close behavioral synchrony. The findings have conceptual implications for the study of inter-subjectivity as well as translational implications for the treatment of social disorders originating in early childhood, such as autism spectrum disorders, or those associated with disruptions to early bonding, such as postpartum depression or child abuse and neglect.

abstract = {Cooperation involves intentional coordinated acts performed to achieve potentially positive outcomes. Here we present a novel explanatory model of cooperation, which focuses on the role of the oxytocinergic system in promoting interpersonal coordination and synchrony. Cooperation was assessed using a novel computerized drawing task that may be performed individually or cooperatively by two participants who coordinate their actions. Using a within-subject crossover design, 42 participants performed the task alone and with a partner following the administration of placebo and oxytocin 1 week apart. The data indicate that following placebo administration, participants performed better alone than in pairs. Yet, the administration of oxytocin improved paired performance up to the level of individual performance. This effect depended on the personality traits of cooperativeness or competitiveness. It is concluded that oxytocin may play a key role in enhancing social synchrony and coordination of behaviors required for cooperation.},

abstract = {To succeed in competitive environments, players need to continuously adjust their decisions and actions to the behaviour of relevant others. Players' interactions demand ongoing decisions that are constrained by what is previously defined (e.g., coaches' prescriptions that establish 'what' to do) and by information that is available in the context and specifies not only 'what' the player should do, but also 'how', 'when' and 'where'. We describe what affordances emerge to the ball carrier as a consequence of changes in kinematic variables, such as interpersonal distances or distances to the nearest sideline. Changes in these variables determine whether and when different actions are possible. The ball carrier tended to perform a pass when the tackler was farthest from the sideline and the velocity of approach to the tackler did not seem to effect the ball carrier's decision. In the few episodes where the ball carrier moved forward instead of passing the ball, he was mainly influenced by contextual information, such as the variability of the players' distance to the nearest sideline. In sum, actors must be aware of the affordances of others that are specified by particular variables that become available just before decision-making.},

We show how collective system networks are supported by the sum of interpersonal interactions that emerge from the activity of system agents (such as players in a sports team). To test this idea we trialled the methodology in analyses of intra-team collective behaviours in the team sport of water polo. We observed that the number of interactions between team members resulted in varied intra-team coordination patterns of play, differentiating between successful and unsuccessful performance outcomes. Future research on small-world networks methodologies needs to formalize measures of node connections in analyses of collective behaviours in sports teams, to verify whether a high frequency of interactions is needed between players in order to achieve competitive performance outcomes.},

abstract = {We seem able to define the biological foundations for our musicality within a clear and unitary framework, yet music itself does not appear so clearly definable. Music is different things and does different things in different cultures; the bundles of elements and functions that are music for any given culture may overlap minimally with those of another culture, even for those cultures where "music" constitutes a discrete and identifiable category of human activity in its own right. The dynamics of culture, of music as cultural praxis, are neither necessarily reducible, nor easily relatable, to the dynamics of our biologies. Yet music appears to be a universal human competence. Recent evolutionary theory, however, affords a means for exploring things biological and cultural within a framework in which they are at least commensurable. The adoption of this perspective shifts the focus of the search for the foundations of music away from the mature and particular expression of music within a specific culture or situation and on to the human capacity for musicality. This paper will survey recent research that examines that capacity and its evolutionary origins in the light of a definition of music that embraces music's multifariousness. It will be suggested that music, like speech, is a product of both our biologies and our social interactions; that music is a necessary and integral dimension of human development; and that music may have played a central role in the evolution of the modern human mind.},

abstract = {Previous research has shown that the matching of rhythmic behaviour between individuals (synchrony) increases cooperation. Such synchrony is most noticeable in music, dance and collective rituals. As well as the matching of behaviour, such collective performances typically involve shared intentionality: performers actively collaborate to produce joint actions. Over three experiments we examined the importance of shared intentionality in promoting cooperation from group synchrony. Experiment 1 compared a condition in which group synchrony was produced through shared intentionality to conditions in which synchrony or asynchrony were created as a by-product of hearing the same or different rhythmic beats. We found that synchrony combined with shared intentionality produced the greatest level of cooperation. To examinef the importance of synchrony when shared intentionality is present, Experiment 2 compared a condition in which participants deliberately worked together to produce synchrony with a condition in which participants deliberately worked together to produce asynchrony. We found that synchrony combined with shared intentionality produced the greatest level of cooperation. Experiment 3 manipulated both the presence of synchrony and shared intentionality and found significantly greater cooperation with synchrony and shared intentionality combined. Path analysis supported a reinforcement of cooperation model according to which perceiving synchrony when there is a shared goal to produce synchrony provides immediate feedback for successful cooperation so reinforcing the group's cooperative tendencies. The reinforcement of cooperation model helps to explain the evolutionary conservation of traditional music and dance performances, and furthermore suggests that the collectivist values of such cultures may be an essential part of the mechanisms by which synchrony galvanises cooperative behaviours.},

exercise induced changes in psychological functions were often described as being a direct consequence of alterations in endogenous opioid release


there are a number of serious problems with the ‘‘endorphin hypothesis.''

b endorphin has almost the same amino acid sequence as other members of the pro-opiomelanocortin family such as the adrenocorticotrophic hormone, making cross reactivity to the detecting antibody a serious confound

adrenocorticotrophic hormone is a stress hormone that is known to increase with exercise, compounding the problem

b endorphins bind best to the m opioid receptor, the endogenous opioid system that mediates the analgesic and euphoric proper- ties of the opiates.

Because endorphins are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier, peripheral activation in the systemic circulation cannot be taken as indicative of central effects.

The most limiting factor, however, is that the endorphin hypothesis rests entirely on research measuring endorphins in circulating blood

Finding: 
data in our laboratory showed that endurance exercise activates the endocannabinoid system,13
suggesting a new
mechanism underlying exercise induced altera- tions of mental status. Using trained male college students running on a treadmill or cycling on a stationary bike for 50 minutes at 70–80{\%} of maximum heart rate, we found that exercise of moderate intensity dramatically increased con- centrations of anandamide in blood plasma

abstract = {Although laughter forms an important part of human non-verbal communication, it has received rather less attention than it deserves in both the experimental and the observational literatures. Relaxed social (Duchenne) laughter is associated with feelings of wellbeing and heightened affect, a proximate explanation for which might be the release of endorphins. We tested this hypothesis in a series of six experimental studies in both the laboratory (watching videos) and naturalistic contexts (watching stage performances), using change in pain threshold as an assay for endorphin release. The results show that pain thresholds are significantly higher after laughter than in the control condition. This pain-tolerance effect is due to laughter itself and not simply due to a change in positive affect. We suggest that laughter, through an endorphin-mediated opiate effect, may play a crucial role in social bonding.},

By hypothesis, these first evolved in human cultures as fundamentally social activities. We therefore hypothesized that children would spontaneously synchronize their body movements to an external beat at earlier ages and with higher accuracy if the stimulus was presented in a social context. A total of 36 children in three age groups (2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years) were invited to drum along with either a human partner, a drumming machine, or a drum sound coming from a speaker. When drumming with a social partner, children as young as 2.5 years adjusted their drumming tempo to a beat outside the range of their spontaneous motor tempo. Moreover, children of all ages synchronized their drumming with higher accuracy in the social condition. We argue that drumming together with a social partner creates a shared representation of the joint action task and/or elicits a specific human motivation to synchronize movements during joint rhythmic activity.},

Two studies were conducted to clarify the relation between challenge and enjoyment. Study 1 focused on a single activity-Internet chess. The importance of challenge was evident at the subjective level (perceived challenge strongly predicted enjoyment) as well as the objective level (games against superior opponents were more enjoyable than games against inferior opponents, and close games were more enjoyable than blowouts). In Study 2, the experience sampling method was used to examine the enjoyment of challenge across a wide range of everyday activities. Activity motivation (intrinsically motivated, non-intrinsically motivated) and activity type (goal directed, non-goal directed) moderated the relation. Implications for theories of intrinsic motivation are discussed.},

In Experiment 1, the sense of self-agency was reduced when the presentation of the tone was unpredictable in terms of timing and its frequency, although in fact the tone was self-produced. In Experiment 2, the opposite case was found to occur. That is, participants experienced illusionary sense of self-agency when the externally generated sensations happened to match the prediction made by forward model. In Experiment 3, the sense of self-agency was reduced when there was a discrepancy between the predicted and actual sensory consequences, regardless of presence or absence of a discrepancy between the intended and actual consequences of actions. In all the experiments, a discrepancy between the predicted and actual feedback had no effects on sense of self-ownership, that is the sense that I am the one who is undergoing an experience.

abstract = {The experience of conscious will is the feeling that we are doing things. This feeling occurs for many things we do, conveying to us again and again the sense that we consciously cause our actions. But the feeling may not be a true reading of what is happening in our minds, brains, and bodies as our actions are produced. The feeling of conscious will can be fooled. This happens in clinical disorders such as alien hand syndrome, dissociative identity disorder, and schizophrenic auditory hallucinations. And in people without disorders, phenomena such as hypnosis, automatic writing, Ouija board spelling, water dowsing, facilitated communication, speaking in tongues, spirit possession, and trance channeling also illustrate anomalies of will--cases when actions occur without will or will occurs without action. This book brings these cases together with research evidence from laboratories in psychology to explore a theory of apparent mental causation. According to this theory, when a thought appears in consciousness just prior to an action, is consistent with the action, and appears exclusive of salient alternative causes of the action, we experience conscious will and ascribe authorship to ourselves for the action. Experiences of conscious will thus arise from processes whereby the mind interprets itself--not from processes whereby mind creates action. Conscious will, in this view, is an indication that we think we have caused an action, not a revelation of the causal sequence by which the action was produced.},

abstract = {The ability to coordinate our actions with those of others is crucial for our success as individuals and as a species. Progress in understanding the cognitive and neural processes involved in joint action has been slow and sparse, because cognitive neuroscientists have predominantly studied individual minds and brains in isolation. However, in recent years, major advances have been made by investigating perception and action in social context. In this article we outline how studies on joint attention, action observation, task sharing, action coordination and agency contribute to the understanding of the cognitive and neural processes supporting joint action. Several mechanisms are proposed that allow individuals to share representations, to predict actions, and to integrate predicted effects of own and others' actions.},
annote = {studying language as a form of joint action;


joint action can be regarded as: any form of social interaction whereby two or more individuals coordinate their actions in space and time to bring about a change in the environment.

successful joint action depends on the abilities 
(i) to share representations, 
(ii) to predict actions, and 
(iii) to integrate predicted effects of own and others' actions.

Joint attention: 
knowing what others perceive (and don't perceive)

joint attention creates a kind of ‘perceptual common ground' in joint action, linking two minds to the same actualities.

precursor to social learning in human development: the ability to selectively attend to an object of mutual interest.

In infants, joint attention develops around the age of
12–18 months [8,9].

At this time, children also start to engage intensively in joint action, for example, building castles with others or playing ball. Initiating and engaging in such joint actions is possible despite the fact that children's theory of mind is far from fully developed at this age, questioning the view held by some philosophers that joint action depends on shared ‘we' intentions [6]

Language shapes joint-attention - is it categorical or relational?

Sharing representations of objects and events:

Clark and Krych showed that joint action performance deteriorates when interaction partners cannot jointly attend to the same objects and events [13].

Action Observation:
during observation of an action, a corresponding representation in the observer's action system is activated -- ‘motor resonance'

Without relying on symbolic communication, individuals could be ‘on the same page' action-wise by sharing representations of actions and their underlying goals

The similarity between an observer's and an actor's action representations might determine the degree to which resonance occurs in the observer

Instead, being able to predict outcomes of others' actions and knowing what others are going to do next is crucial [24]. Several findings suggest that motor resonance also supports action prediction [25,26].

superior temporal sulcus (STS) seems to be involved in action prediction, and in particular in the updating of predictions after a violation has occurred.

Activation in this area was observed when participants' expectation about a walker appearing behind an occluder was violated [28], and when they watched an actor lifting a box the weight of which differed from what the actor expected [29]

Task-sharing: knowing what others should do

Observing an error elicited medial frontal activity similar to that elicited by making an error oneself, suggesting that similar neural mechan- isms are involved in monitoring one's own and others' task performance. 

results suggest that predictive mechanisms in the human action system, as well as mechanisms supporting mental state attribution, can be triggered by shared task representations [31].

a series of recent studies has shown that individuals form shared representations of tasks quasi- automatically, even when it is more effective to ignore one another.

Imitation system needs to be suppressed to avoid acting when it was the other's turn:



individuals incorporate others' action capabilities into their own action planning, and how temporal feed- back about others' actions is used in anticipatory action control.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors quantified nonverbal synchrony--the coordination of patient's and therapist's movement--in a random sample of same-sex psychotherapy dyads. The authors contrasted nonverbal synchrony in these dyads with a control condition and assessed its association with session-level and overall psychotherapy outcome.

METHOD: Using an automated objective video analysis algorithm (Motion Energy Analysis; MEA), the authors calculated nonverbal synchrony in (n = 104) videotaped psychotherapy sessions from 70 Caucasian patients (37 women, 33 men, mean age = 36.5 years, SD = 10.2) treated at an outpatient psychotherapy clinic. The sample was randomly drawn from an archive (N = 301) of routinely videotaped psychotherapies. Patients and their therapists assessed session impact with self-report post-session questionnaires. A battery of pre- and postsymptomatology questionnaires measured therapy effectiveness.

RESULTS: The authors found that nonverbal synchrony is higher in genuine interactions contrasted with pseudointeractions (a control condition generated by a specifically designed shuffling procedure). Furthermore, nonverbal synchrony is associated with session-level process as well as therapy outcome: It is increased in sessions rated by patients as manifesting high relationship quality and in patients experiencing high self-efficacy. Higher nonverbal synchrony characterized psychotherapies with higher symptom reduction.

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that nonverbal synchrony embodies the patients' self-reported quality of the relationship and further variables of therapy process. This hitherto overlooked facet of therapeutic relationships might prove useful as an indicator of therapy progress and outcome.},

The present study investigated how people coordinate their actions at discrete points in time when continuous or rhythmic information about others' actions is not available. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that making oneself predictable is used as a coordination strategy. Pairs of participants were instructed to coordinate key presses in a two-choice reaction time task, either responding in synchrony (Experiments 1 and 2) or in close temporal succession (Experiment 3). Across all experiments, we found that coactors reduced the variability of their actions in the joint context compared with the same task performed individually. Correlation analyses indicated that the less variable the actions were, the better was interpersonal coordination. The relation between reduced variability and improved coordination performance was not observed when pairs of participants performed independent tasks next to each other without intending to coordinate. These findings support the claim that reducing variability is used as a coordination strategy to achieve predictability. Identifying coordination strategies contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in real-time coordination.},

annote = {Finally, we focus on our most recent research regarding the psychological consequences of such patterns, particularly for the emergence of social connectedness

Cognitive processes operate in service of behavior; the evolutionary development of cognition was not to direct and simulate (re-present) the world to the mind but originally developed out of the need to coordinate and integrate increasingly complex behavioral repertoires that extended in scope across time and space

A better metaphor for the brain is a ‘‘traffic facilitator,'' helping to ‘‘sustain the necessary conditions for the rele- vant interaction between body and world to take place'' (van Dijk et al., 2008, p. 309)

not directing behavior but instead biasing the system toward selecting certain environment- evoked behaviors in one's behavioral repertoire over others.

It is in large part because we move (and thus must seek what we need to survive and
to procreate) that a cognitive system emerged.

In a real sense, the behavior of an organism (and so too, we believe, the coordinated behav- ior of multiple organisms) has primacy over the emergence of a brain to coordinate such behaviors.

there are many circumstances in which individuals spontaneously are pulled
into the orbit of another's incidental movements, and there are many circumstances where the environmental constraints, or the limitations of our own autonomous action, mean that coordinated joint action comes into being.

We think that systematically exploring the infor- mational basis for this emergence, and the dynamics that can allow the self-organization of coordinated action to occur is worthy of study not because we think it implies humans are creatures without intention and mental states but rather because research demonstrates just how integrally intertwined all body systems (brain, sensory, psychological, perception, movement) are when engaging in joint action, and that a theory of the dynamics of self organization is needed to understand the complexity of such interacting components.

Despite the physical separateness of our bodies from other bodies, this social pull is as fundamental and essential to functioning in an environment as the coordination that occurs within components of our body

We argue that the answer to why our possibilities for moving and for completing actions are so jointly constrained requires understanding the dynamical laws that govern action systems of the body, the coupling of perception and action, and the coupling of person to environment.

Just as the picking up of information about our environment is fundamental to the performance of action—with seeing of obstacles in our way and continuously adjusting our motion telegraphed across our body—so too, we argue, is an individual in a social context fundamentally constrained by the picking up of information about others' incidental movements and intentional actions.



3. Social consequences of synchrony and cooperative action：

we would also predict that a stronger cooperation attractor (i.e., greater hysteresis when individuals move planks presented in a sequence of descending size) should correlate with participants' subjective reactions to the other individual.

A similar prediction is that preexisting dispositional tendencies in sociality dimensions of personality (e.g., extroversion, agreeableness) will affect how strongly a social unity emerges from two individuals' interaction

Schmidt and colleagues (Schmidt, Christianson, Carello, {\&} Baron, 1994) used interpersonal wrist-pendulum coordination to investigate the effects of social competence (Riggio, 1996) upon social coordination stability.

Subjects were selected to create homogeneous social competence dyads (High–High or Low–Low pairs) and heterogeneous dyads (High–Low pairs). The heterogeneous (High–Low) pairs demonstrated significantly greater stability and fewer breakdowns in coordination than the homogeneous (High–High and Low–Low) social competence pairings, suggesting that reci- procity (leader-follower) rather than symmetry (leader-leader or follower-follower) of social competence facilitates social coordination.

Similarly, questionnaires administered at the end of the plank moving experiment (Richardson et al., 2007a) found that individuals' levels of agreeableness and extroversion (Benet-Martinez {\&} John, 1998) were positively correlated with how much hysteresis (persistence of cooperation in the descending condition) occurred.

That is, the degree of cooperation in the plank-moving experiment was positively correlated with the taller of the pair's extroversion in the ascending condition, r = .51; the degree of cooperation in the random condition (where planks were received in no ordinal sequence of sizing) was correlated with the agreeableness of the shorter (more constraining) of the indi- viduals, r = .54.

Dispositional tendencies, in a sense, might set the initial conditions that make pull to the cooperation attractor stronger (or weaker) than a pull to the autonomy attractor (independent action).


Dysfunctions in dynamics of movement should have implications for social disconnec-
tion as well. Such disconnection would be expected to arise with preferred tempo of move- ment that are normatively unusual (very fast or slow walker), or of unusual rigidity (low variability in movement)

Individuals who fail to attend to the dynamics of others, either due to lack of ability or lack of motivation would likely feel less psychologically connected when engaging in joint perception and joint action.

On the other hand, for those with mild movement limitations, others may provide a ‘‘mooring effect,'' helping those with limita- tions to be tethered in space and time to the social environment.

That is, individuals with somewhat poorer ability to coordinate with the rhythms of the world may be better able to coordinate their actions with the environment if movements of others pulls them into their orbit (see Schmidt et al., 1994).

Indeed, much like how arousal from the presence of others serves to facilitate performance on some tasks (Zajonc, 1965), the auditory rhythm move- ment of the movement of others (and one's own) feet on a long march, or the visual stimulus of the feet of a person in front of oneself continually moving on a long hike up a mountain may provide an energy kick to our own movement, much as a nearby firefly's flash hastens the upcoming flash of another firefly (Strogatz, 1994).

Synchrony may have cognitive benefits as well. Engaging in joint action might employ
jointly recruited processes that allow access to others' states (Hutchins, 1995; Semin, 2007; Semin {\&} Cacioppo, 2008).

Moreover, being connected socially and environmentally should be felt not only in terms of liking and feeling of entativity (groupness) but also more gener- alized feelings of harmony and flow—a feeling of perceptual fluency, which may aid memory storage or retrieval processes (Macrae, Duffy, Miles, {\&} Lawrence, 2008; Ravizza, 2003).

We would expect that being moored by another may actually free up attentional capacity and provide more subsequent cognitive resources (e.g., Richeson {\&} Shelton, 2003).


1. Behavioral, embodied methods can be used to investigate sociality

A wide variety of behavioral paradigms demonstrate that we are responsive to movement of another

necessary but not sufficient evidence for its relevance to sociality, since similar bodily synchronization to nonsocial rhythmic stimuli occurs as well (Lopresti-Goodman et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2007)

the recent results reported above demonstrate that being pulled into the orbit of another's body may be a rather fundamental, body-based way for instantiating a socioemotional connection with another


2. Dynamic systems:
To understand processes of social coordination, we need to turn to the universal logic of stability of natural systems: dynamical processes of self-organization

Such dynamical prin- ciples constrain the coordination of limbs of single bodies as well as those of multiple bodies

The research we have reviewed demonstrates the extent to which principles of dynamics that govern the coordination of intrapersonal movements can be used to under- stand the array of stabilities that arise in interpersonal coordination. 

Further, we contend that it is via the dynamical laws of energy dissipative systems that emergence of a social unit is even possible.

Such a perspective stands in contrast from the top-down, strategic processes involved in deciding to form a coalition with another.

In everyday life, spontaneous emer- gence of temporary form (social ‘‘eddies'') are probably a more frequent part of everyday social life than the intentional actions involved with a cheerleading team doing a planned cheer, clapping and yelling together, a team of rowers rowing together, or a workgroup cooperating to create some work product. Although

Research has examined the dynamical patterns involved in joint action that is competitive, such as when play- ing basketball against another person (Newtson, Hairfield, Bloomingdale, {\&} Cutino, 1987), or fencing (Issartel, Marin, Bardainne, Gaillot, {\&} Cadopi, 2005a), or cooperative, as when generating simple dance (Issartel, Marin, {\&} Cadopi, 2005b) or folding a sheet together (Kean, 2000).


3. The measurement aims to be truly at the level of the relation between the person-person-environment fit rather than inside the head.

focus here is on a social unit at the level of the environment rather than an internal representation of the other's movement that is the focus of a cognitivist, individualist perspective.

our work concerns the emergence of a social unit
two or more individuals acting and perceiving as improbably coherent wholes.

objectively measurable real- ity (e.g., degree of coherence in their shared wave forms, amount of time spent in coordi- nated states).

Our conclusion is that understanding social action requires studying social systems as coherent units, with interpersonal and individual behavior, individual dispositional properties (dispositional or group status) and the action capabilities of individ- ual bodies all understood as emergent properties of embodied-embedded joint perception- action systems.},

In this review, we integrate 3 evolutionary arguments that converge on the hypothesis that compassion evolved as a distinct affective experience whose primary function is to facilitate cooperation and protection of the weak and those who suffer. Our empirical review reveals compassion to have distinct appraisal processes attuned to undeserved suffering; distinct signaling behavior related to caregiving patterns of touch, posture, and vocalization; and a phenomenological experience and physiological response that orients the individual to social approach. This response profile of compassion differs from those of distress, sadness, and love, suggesting that compassion is indeed a distinct emotion. We conclude by considering how compassion shapes moral judgment and action, how it varies across different cultures, and how it may engage specific patterns of neural activation, as well as emerging directions of research.},

We predicted that synchrony, due to an ability to elicit low-level appraisals of similarity, would enhance a basic compassionate response toward victims of moral transgressions and thereby increase subsequent costly helping behavior on their behalf. Using a manipulation of rhythmic synchrony, we show that synchronous others are not only perceived to be more similar to oneself but also evoke more compassion and altruistic behavior than asynchronous others experiencing the same plight. These findings both support the view that a primary function of synchrony is to mark others as similar to the self and provide the first empirical demonstration that synchrony-induced affiliation modulates emotional responding and altruism.},

In Experiment 1, participants were prompted to retell autobiographical memories with either positive or negative valence, while moving marbles either upward or downward. They retrieved memories faster when the direction of movement was congruent with the valence of the memory (upward for positive, downward for negative memories). Given neutral-valence prompts in Experiment 2, participants retrieved more positive memories when instructed to move marbles up, and more negative memories when instructed to move them down, demonstrating a causal link from motion to emotion. Results suggest that positive and negative life experiences are implicitly associated with schematic representations of upward and downward motion, consistent with theories of metaphorical mental representation. Beyond influencing the efficiency of memory retrieval, the direction of irrelevant, repetitive motor actions can also partly determine the emotional content of the memories people retrieve: moving marbles upward (an ostensibly meaningless action) can cause people to think more positive thoughts.},

They observed pattern-forming dynamics in attacking subunits (n = 4 players) attempting to penetrate 2 defensive lines (n = 2 players in each). Data showed that within each attacking subunit, the 4 players displayed emergent functional grouping tendencies that differed between the 2 defensive lines. Results confirmed that grouping tendencies in attacking subunits of team games are sensitive to different task constraints, such as relative positioning to nearest defenders. It was concluded that running correlations were particularly useful for measuring the level of interpersonal coordination in functional grouping tendencies within attacking subunits.},

In some trials group members had no information about others' movements (their eyes were shut) or they had their eyes open and gazed at a marker in the center of the group. As predicted, the group level synchrony measure was able to distinguish between situations where synchrony would have been possible and situations where it would be impossible. Moreover, other aspects of the analysis illustrated how the cluster phase measures can be used to determine the type of patterning of group synchrony, and, when integrated with multi-level modeling, can be used to examine individual-level differences in synchrony and dyadic level synchrony as well.},

@article{Dunbar2008,
annote = {The social brain hypothesis was first proposed (as the Machiavellian Intel-
ligence Hypothesis) in the late 1980s by Byrne {\&} Whiten (1988) as an expla- nation for the fact that primates have much larger brains for body size than any other taxonomic group (a point first noted by Jerison 1973)

Primates rely on sociality as a tool for solving the everyday ecological problems of survival and successful re- production rather than solving these problems by individual trial and error.

So the proposal was that primates' more complex social lives imposed signifi- cantly greater cognitive demands on them than was the case for other non- primate species.

One of the core find- ings was a quantitative relationship between social group size and relative neocortex size in primates (Fig. 1). On a double-log plot, mean species group size is linearly related to relative neocortex size (indexed as the ratio of neo- cortex volume to the volume of the rest of the brain). 

However, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that this group size effect is really only an emergent property of the underlying rela- tionship which focuses on the cognitive demands of behavioural complexity


test the social brain hypothesis on non-primate species (Shultz and Dunbar 2007; Dunbar and Shultz 2007b) have shown that, across a wide range of bird and mammal species (specifically carnivores, ungulates and bats), the social brain hypothesis takes a qualitative rather than a quantitative form. In all these taxonomic groups

it is pairbonded (i.e. repro- ductively monogamous) species that have disproportionately large brains. 

Anthropoid primates contrast strikingly with this pattern in that they exhibit a quantitative relationship between group size and brain size.

These results suggest that it is the cognitive demands of pairbonding that
underpin the social brain (thereby leading to the initial enlargement of brain size in several animal families), 

and that anthropoid primates (and maybe one or two other numerically small groups such as elephants and the horse family) have extended the use of these pairbond-like relationships to other non-reproductive group members – thereby creating the quantitative relationship that we observe in their case (Shultz and Dunbar 2007).

In effect, they have developed what we might well refer to as "friendships" (Smuts 1985; Silk 2002), relationships that have all the characteristics of pairbonds but without the sexual connotation – although perhaps this may explain why friendships can so easily acquire sexual overtones in humans.

In anthropoid primates, friendships function as alliances – reciprocal coalitions whose members relia- bly come to each other's aid (see for example, Dunbar 1980, 1989)

These serve the important function of buffering individuals against the costs of group-living – competition during foraging, and the persistent forms of low level harassment consequent on living in close proximity to others that results in infertility in females in both captivity and the wild (Abbott et al. 1986; Dunbar 1980).

irds allow us to sort this out because some species have one without the other: this dissociation dem- onstrates unequivocally that it is species with pairbonds, irrespective of whether or not they have bi-parental care, that have large brains.},

This article explores whether synchronous activity may serve as a partial solution to the free-rider problem facing groups that need to motivate their members to contribute toward the collective good. Across three experiments, people acting in synchrony with others cooperated more in subsequent group economic exercises, even in situations requiring personal sacrifice. Our results also showed that positive emotions need not be generated for synchrony to foster cooperation. In total, the results suggest that acting in synchrony with others can increase cooperation by strengthening social attachment among group members.},

First, drawing from optimal distinctiveness theory, we discuss 4 ways in which the need for belonging and the need to be different can be resolved by maximizing group distinctiveness. We then discuss 4 ways in which it is possible to achieve individual differentiation within a group at the same time demonstrating group identification. These strategies are discussed and integrated with reference to recent empirical research and to the social identity perspective.},

initiation rites suggests that traumatic rites can be interpreted as costly signals of group commitment, which appear to be especially prevalent among warring groups (Sosis et al., 2007). However, it is more difficult to account for the variation we observe in dysphoric arousal across rituals in general (as opposed to male initiations, in particular) in terms of a costly signalling explanation.

Agricultural intensity is related to dysphoric arousal as predicted, but the relationship between dysphoric arousal and group size is not significant in the multi-level analysis and is significant in the opposite direction to that predicted in the simple society-level analysis

Likewise, we find no relationship between dysphoric arousal and the presence of warfare. As they suggest, this may be due to the fact that other mechanisms are used to facilitate cooperation in larger groups

Sosis et al. (2007) also found the opposite to expected relationship between the costliness of initiation rites and group size. 

One possibility consistent with a costly signalling explanation is that larger groups may use time investment (in the form of high-frequency rituals) as a signal of commitment rather than rare but intensely painful or unpleasant rituals'

It is unlikely, then, that dysphoric ritual arousal in general is the result of a need to provide costly signals of group commitment under conditions of warfare, even if initiations do perform this role.},

abstract = {Previous research has documented the consequences of feeling fused with a group; here we examine the nature of identity fusion. Specifically, we sought to determine what fusion is and the mediating mechanisms that lead fused individuals to make extraordinary sacrifices for their group. Guided by the assumption that fusion emphasizes the extent to which people develop relational ties to the group, we developed a measure designed to capture feelings of connectedness and reciprocal strength with the group. In 10 studies, the newly developed scale displayed predicted relationships with related measures, including an earlier (pictorial) measure of fusion and a measure of group identification. Also as expected, fusion scores were independent of several measures of personality and identity. Moreover, the scale predicted endorsement of extreme progroup behaviors with greater fidelity than did an earlier pictorial measure of identity fusion, which was, in turn, superior to a measure of group identification. Earlier evidence that the personal and social selves of fused persons are functionally equivalent was replicated, and it was shown that feelings of agency and invulnerability mediated the effects of fusion on extreme behavior. Finally, Spanish- and English-language versions of the verbal fusion scale showed similar factor structure as well as evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in samples of Spaniards and Americans, as well as immigrants from 22 different countries. This work advances a new perspective on the interplay between social and personal identity.},

We accordingly proposed that increasing the agency of fused persons by elevating autonomic arousal would amplify their tendency to endorse and actually enact pro-ingroup behavior. In 4 experiments, increasing autonomic arousal through physical exercise elevated heart rates and fusion-unrelated activity among all participants. Fused participants, however, uniquely responded to arousal by translating elevated agency into endorsement of pro-group activity. These effects emerged both for endorsement of extreme behaviors for the group and for overt behaviors, specifically helping behavior (donating money to needy in-group members), and the speed with which participants raced a fusion-related avatar. The effects also generalized across 3 different arousal inductions (dodgeball, wind sprints, and Exercycle). Finally, fusion-related agency partially mediated the interactive effects of fusion and arousal on pro-group behavior. Apparently, autonomic arousal increases agency and identity fusion channels increased agency into pro-group behavior.},
annote = {Take-aways: 

identity fusion serves to figuratively cock the group-action trigger:

pulling the group-action trigger depends on manipulating personal agency. 

because fused participants regard the group as an externalization of the personal self, for such individuals, the elevated agency fostered by the arousal manipulation should produce elevated agency for the focal group

increasing the arousal of fused participants through group exercise increased their endorsement of extreme actions for their group (Exp1)

Experiment 2: Wind sprints and fusion to Spain and Europe
raising the arousal of participants through exercise increased their endorsement of extreme actions for the group with which they were fused

fusion measure uniquely taps people's propensity for extreme behavior. In short, when fused persons' agency was augmented by physiological arousal, their endorsement of extreme action in- creased.

this is the first study to demonstrate a link between fusion and an overt behavior: participants' donations to needy in-group members (helping behaviour)

mechanism that regulates the tendency of fused persons to engage in pro-group actions: agency


Introduction:
a feeling of oneness with the group that induces people to tether their feelings of personal agency to the group: the "ought" on behalf of the group?

Physiological arousal as a form of psychological agency: we exercise to feel in control...


Agency: the capacity to initiate and control intentional behavior

Fused participants, however, uniquely responded to arousal by translating elevated agency into endorsement of pro-group activity

Autonomic arousal increases agency and identity fusion channels increased agency into pro-group behavior.



Identification, Identity Fusion, and the Interplay of Personal and Social Identities

This study will contrast fusion with group identification.

Personal versus group identities:
Personal identities: are derived from those aspects of the self that are unique to the individual self - categories attached to the self.
Social identities: result from membership in social groups (e.g., American or psychologist) and align people with other group members - categories attached to the group

The key difference between identification and identity fusion is in how personal and social identities are thought to interact when people align themselves with a group

Group identification theory:
there is a zero-sum relationship between personal and social identities: The more social identities are acti- vated, the less personal identities are activated. One implication of this assumption is that the process of identifying with the group reduces the capacity of people to think of themselves as individual actors with personal agendas (824)

the individual becomes depersonalized and the personal self is less apt to guide behavior
- Bion and the unthinking group

it is consistent with principles such as functional antagonism as well as social identity theory's emphasis on the tendency for the social context to shape the personal self (Turner, 1985; Turner et al., 1987).

Identity Fusion: 
identity fusion approach departs from the dominant social identity model by assuming that fused persons retain a salient personal self and associated feelings of personal agency

- surely this is only under certain circumstances?? I.e., in contexts in which personal agency is encouraged and nurtured? 

Although fusion could arise from a single, emotionally powerful experience with a group, in most instances, it likely grows out of several direct or indirect contacts with the members of the ingroup, outgroup, or society at large

feeling of oneness with the group and a sense of shared essence. These sentiments toward the group do not cause fused persons to lose sight of their personal selves or subjugate the personal self to the group

fusion process merely adds group-related action as a potential mode of personal self- expression

absolute, unmitigated commitment to engage in pro-group activity.1
It is thus not surprising that fusion
predicts endorsement of extreme pro-group actions even while controlling for identification (Swann et al., 2009, in press)

fusion is not a trait in the classical sense, as it may vary somewhat with context and is specific to particular target persons or groups

fused people are markedly more committed to acting on behalf of the group, the way in which commitment manifests, however, varies...



Measurement: 
Inclusion of Other in Self Scale (IOS): originally developed to assess attachment in close relationships. Specifically, Aron, Aron, and Smollan (1992) developed a pictorial measure of connectedness to relationship partners.
a continuous measure of the degree to which people possess a “sense of being interconnected with another,”
“including resources, perspec- tives, and characteristics of the other” (Aron et al., 1992, p. 598).

Fusion scale: In contrast, the oneness with the group that fused persons feel is thought to be based on the perception of shared essence rather than confusion of self and other or a tendency to incorporate the other.

fused option (E) indicates that the personal self retains its uniqueness and integrity but is completely immersed in the other

fused persons are not presumed to feel that the group is a part of the self as in the most extreme option of the IOS

fused individuals acknowledge that self–group influence is bidirectional: Just as the self may internalize qualities of the other, so too may the group represent an externalization of the self

identity fusion predicts endorsement of extreme pro-group behavior even while controlling for identification (10 studies, Swann et al. 2009)

The distinctiveness of identity fusion: activating personal agency
to test the assumption that the personal and social identities of fused persons are integrally connected, Swann et al. (2009) activated the personal selves of participants who were fused with Spain by providing them with discrepant feedback on personal qualities that were unrelated to the Spanish group identity (e.g., shy, stubborn)

activating the personal selves of fused individuals did indeed raise their endorsement of extreme action on behalf of the group

Pulling the group action trigger: personal agency
any manip- ulation that increases agency should theoretically increase pro- group behavior (cf. Reicher{\&}Haslam, 2006)

studies of nonhumans demonstrate that arousal of the sympathetic nervous system encourages animals to enact responses that they are pre- disposed to make (Jacobs {\&} Farel, 1971)

heightened arousal can increase in- group favoritism and stereotyping among highly identified group members (e.g., Branscombe {\&} Wann, 1992; Wann {\&} Branscombe, 1995).

identification may not moderate the tendency for arousal to amplify pro-group behaviors that are enacted by individuals acting alone, as past research has shown that identifi- cation is not strongly related to the tendency for people to act as individuals for the group (Swann et al., 2009, in press). In contrast, fusion should moderate the tendency for arousal to amplify pro- group behavior of individuals acting alone, even while controlling for identification.

A general relationship between arousal and emotion? 
- Zillmann (1971): excitation transfer theory, arousal may produce residual excitement that serves to intensify later emotional states
- nonspecific arousal increases outcomes such as aggression (e.g., Zillmann, 1971; Zillman {\&} Bryant, 1974)
- arousing experiences produced excitation that en- hanced subsequent sexual attraction (Dutton {\&} Aron, 1974; Meston {\&} Frohlich, 2003) and sense of humor (Cantor, Bryant, {\&} Zillmann, 1974).

Method:
4 experiments, all conducted in Spain
no-arousal control group, and each included measures of identifi- cation as well as fusion with the group
effects of our predictor variables following exercise (fusion, identification, and arousal) on endorsement of pro-group activity.
- generalisability of different arousal manipulations: we had some a group dodgeball game (Experiment 1); run wind sprints (Experiment 2) ride an Exercycle (Experiments 3–4).

to extend the effects of fusion and arousal beyond the outcome variables examined in past research (i.e., intentions to fight or die for the group),Experiments 3–4, we added two measures of actual overt behavior: how much of their own money participants donated to needy members of the focal group and how fast they raced a fusion-related avatar (the “Spanish sprinter”).

Contrast focal-group (Spain) motivations with non-focal group (Europe).

to test rival hypothesis that the arousal manipulation might work by fostering feelings of competitiveness, we included a measure of self-perceived competitiveness in the last two experiments

we expected that the arousal manipulation would increase heart rate and agency among all participants but that self-professed agency for the group would mediate the interactive effects of fusion and arousal on pro-group behavior among fused persons only.

Preliminary Studies:
1. Justification of fusion and identity scales in Spain: the Mael and Ashforth scale in our experiments as the representative measure of identification
2. 
The overall pattern of results therefore provides clear evidence that fusion and commitment are correlated and fusion predicts pro-group behavior more strongly than com- mitment does. 
fusion is an index of alignment with one's group that is related to but distinct from both identification and commitment to the group. 

fusion is a stronger predictor of endorsement of pro-group behavior than are identification and commitment, and there is preliminary evidence that the impact of fusion on pro-group behavior is mediated by a tendency for fusion to bolster commitment to the group

Experiment 1:
245 (99 girls, 146 boys, mean age = 15.34, SD = .097) high school students in Madrid, Spain
participants were introduced to an investigation of the relationship of arousal to their autonomic responses and emotional reactions.
- Baseline Heart Rate
- Swann et al.'s (2009) measure of identity fusion (cf. Schubert {\&} Otten, 2002) and Mael and Ashforth's (1992) Identification Scale (alpha = .82).
fusion was treated as a dichotomous variable, such that participants were considered fused only if they endorsed the option in which the self was completely overlapping with the group (for a discussion and justification, see Swann et al., 2009)
- Rate of fusion in this sample was 32.7{\%}. The correlation between fusion and identification was positive but modest, r(243) ? .33, p ? .001 (as in our earlier work, the correlation rose slightly, r ? .43, if fusion was treated as a continuous scale)
Phase 1: 
Dodgeball, with competetive component eliminated, those struck by the ball changed teams rather than being eliminated.
Phase 2: 
- Heart rate:
- measures of endorsement of
extreme behavior developed by Swann et al. (2009):
7-point scales ranging from?3(totally disagree)to3(totally agree)
“I would fight someone physically threatening another Spaniard,”
“I would fight someone insulting or making fun of Spain as a whole,” “I would help others get revenge on someone who insulted Spain,” 
“Hurting other people is acceptable if it means protecting the group,” 
“I'd do anything to protect the group.”
Results Exp 1:
The predictors were fusion, arousal, identification, all two-way interactions, and the triple interaction:
- interaction between fusion and arousal emerged, B ? 0.30, t(237) = 3.70, p {\textless} .001.
- nonfused participants were not influenced by the arousal manipulation, B = 0.04, t(237) = 0.48, p {\textgreater} .72.
- Anomolous interaction: Fusion Identification interaction,
B ??0.28, t(237) ??3.70, p ? .001. Follow-up analyses indicated that the tendency for identification to increase endorse- ment of extreme actions for the group was significant among fused participants, B ? 0.33, t(237) ? 2.48, p ? .05, but somewhat stronger among nonfused participants, B ? 0.57, t(237) ? 7.51, p?.001. This surprising interaction was apparently anomalous, as it did not emerge again in any of the subsequent investigations reported here
- A main effect of fusion also emerged, such that fused partici-
pants showed more extreme actions for the group than did non- fused participants, B ? 0.79, t(237) ? 9.81, p ? .001 (M ? 0.69, SD ? 1.21, vs. M ??1.15, SD ? 1.08, respectively; in all experiments in this report, the effect of fusion was significant in both the control and the arousal conditions
- A marginal effect of arousal also emerged, B ? 0.15, t(237) ? 1.91, p ? .06, indicating that participants in the arousal condition displayed stronger endorsement of extreme actions for the group than did participants in the control condition (M ??0.39, SD ? 1.54, vs. M ??0.73, SD ? 1.24).
- a main effect of identification emerged, with higher identification being associated with greater endorsement of extreme actions for the group, B ? 0.79, t(237) ? 9.81, p ? .001.

Covariation between heart rate and endorsement of extreme
actions:
predicted interaction between heart rate at Phase 2 and
fusion emerged, 
As expected, for fused participants, heart rate during Phase 2 predicted endorsement of extreme actions for the group, 
for nonfused participants, heart rate during Phase 2 did not predict endorsement of extreme actions for the group,
There was also a main effect of pulse at Phase 2
among nonfused participants, endorsement of extreme actions remained uniformly low, even when they were aroused

Experiment 2: Will Increasing Arousal by
Running Wind Sprints Amplify Extreme Behavior for the Group?
n=190 (69 girls, 121 boys, mean age = 15.14)
Three modifications from Exp1:
1. During Phase 1, we added measures of fusion and identification in which the reference group was Europe. 
- Rate of fusion with Spain in this sample was 38.4{\%}, and rate of fusion with Europe was 5.8{\%}. degrees of fusion with Spain and Europe were uncorrelated, r(188) ? .06, p ? .40, but degrees of identification with Spain and Europe were correlated, r(188) ? .44, p ? .001

2. Phase 2, measured participants' endorsement of extreme actions for Europe as well as Spain (?s?.85 and .90, respectively)

3. changed the arousal manipulation from a group to an individual task: 90 second sprints, instructed to increase their speed with ueach successive sprint. 

Manipulation checks were good

Results Exp 2: 
Endorsement of extreme actions: sought to determine if 
(a) arousal interacted with fusion with Spain to predict extreme actions for Spain (but not for Europe) and 
(b) arousal interacted with fusion with Europe to predict extreme actions for Europe (but not for Spain). 

Regression of extreme actions for Spain and extreme actions for Europe (a repeated measures variable) with predictors:
1. arousal (?1, 1),
2. fusion with Spain (?1, 1), 
3. Arousal X Fusion With Spain, fusion with Europe (?1, 1), 
4. Arousal X Fusion With Europe, 
5. identification with Spain and Europe.

- Three-way interaction between Arousal X Fusion
With Spain X Extreme Actions for Spain and Europe emerged, F(1, 177) ? 4.83, p ? .05.
- Arousal interacted with fusion with Spain to predict extreme actions for Spain, F(1, 182) ? 6.64, p ? .001 but for nonfused participants, arousal had no impact, F(1, 182) ? 1.71, p?.19.
- three-way interaction between Arousal X
Fusion With Europe X Extreme Actions for Spain and Europe also emerged, F(1, 177) ? 4.36, p ? .05.
Arousal interacted with fusion with Europe to predict extreme actions for Europe, F(1, 182) ? 5.36, p ? .01

The predicted interaction between heart rate at Phase 2 and
fusion emerged, B ? 0.08, t(185) ? 3.02, p ? .01. As expected, for fused participants, heart rate during Phase 2 predicted endorse- ment of extreme actions for Europe, B ? 0.61, t(185) ? 1.99, p ? .05

raising the arousal of participants through exercise increased their endorsement of extreme actions for the group with which they were fused

As in Experiment 1, although fused participants were no more aroused than nonfused participants were overall, fusion in- teracted with arousal to produce substantial endorsement of ex- treme behavior for the focal group

Experiment 3:
we manipulated arousal by having participants ride an exercycle in private for 10 min - sprints and dodge ball did not eliminate rival hypothesis of competitiveness.

overt behavioral measure of pro-group activity: donation to needy Spaniards versus fund a party at their high school

what about the time taken between phase and phase two, is there a difference between arousal and control conditions? Does it matter? 

Agency for the group: three items based on Haggard and Tsakiris's (2009) discussion of the agency construct. Participants responded to three items with reference to Spain. On 7-point scales ranging from 0 (totally disagree)to6(totally agree), participants rated their agreement with these items: “I have as much control over the group's out- comes as my own actions,” “I feel responsible for what happens to the group,” and “I feel responsible for what the group does.” 

Competitiveness check: following the end of phase 2.

Donation task, (10 euro total): €5 or a portion of that amount to a fund for needy Spaniards and the other €5 or a portion of that amount to a high school party that would be occur at the end of the school year. 

Results Exp3:
- interaction between Arousal ? Fusion
With Spain ? Extreme Actions for Spain and Europe emerged, F(1, 107) ? 39.79, p ? .001
- Arousal interacted with fusion with Spain to predict extreme actions for Spain, F(1, 112) ? 54.70, p ? .001
- for fused participants, arousal increased endorsement of extreme actions for the group, F(1, 112) ? 8.53, p ? .01, but for nonfused participants, arousal had no impact, F(1, 112)?0.40, p?.63.

Donations to the needy: 
- needy Spaniard fund, fusion in- teracted with arousal to predict donation, B ? 0.56, t(112) ? 4.46, p ? .001. 
fused participants donated more in the arousal condition than in the control condition, B ? 1.63, t(112) ? 8.87, p ? .001
- among nonfused participants, no difference between the arousal and control conditions emerged, B?0.40, t(112)?1.69, p?.10.
- only a main effect of arousal, B ? 0.74, t(112) ? 8.28, p ? .001, indicating that all participants donated more in the arousal condition than in the control condition (M?3.32, SD?0.85, vs.M?1.78, SD?0.87, respectively)

Agency mediation:
fused participants donated most of their money to the needy Spaniard fund, and this ceiling effect may have undermined the mediation effect. In an effort to find a measure of overt behavior that would display more variability, we re- placed the donation variable with a new dependent variable in Experiment 4.
this is the first study to demonstrate a link between fusion and an overt behavior: participants' donations to needy in-group members


In particular, after the experimenter recorded their donations, roughly half of the fused participants in the arousal condition (but no other participants) spontaneously offered to augment their €5 contribution to needy Spaniards with additional funds that they happened to have with them! Such was the power of fusion and arousal as interactive motivators of helping behavior.

Experiment 4:
Fusion, arousal, and sprinter, F(1, 106)?4.64, p ? .05. To evaluate this interaction, the effects of fusion and arousal were examined separately for the Spanish and generic sprinters.

Spanish sprinter, fusion interacted with arousal to predict speed, B??0.22, t(106)??4.91, p ? .001 fused participants were faster in the arousal condition than in the control condition, B ??0.61, t(106) ??8.58, p ? .001.

In contrast, among nonfused participants, no difference emerged between the arousal and control conditions, B ??0.11, t(106) ??1.15, p ? .20

there was only a main effect of arousal, B ??0.15, t(106) ??2.11, p ? .05, such that all participants were faster in the arousal condition than in the control condition (M ? 11.57, SD ? 0.63, vs. M ? 11.91, SD ? 0.68, respectively).

Agency:
For fused participants, arousal strongly increased fusion-related agency, B?1.03, t(106)?9.30, p?.001 (M ? 3.02, SD ? 0.77, vs. M ? 4.25, SD ? 0.96, respectively)

fused participants showed more agency associated with the group than did nonfused partic- ipants, B ? 0.76, t(106) ? 9.86, p ? .001 (M ? 3.89, SD ? 1.07, and M ? 2.09, SD ? 0.54, respectively)

abstract = {Much attention has focused on the dramatic expansion of the forebrain, particularly the neocortex, as the neural substrate of cognitive evolution. However, though relatively small, the cerebellum contains about four times more neurons than the neocortex. I show that commonly used comparative measures such as neocortex ratio underestimate the contribution of the cerebellum to brain evolution. Once differences in the scaling of connectivity in neocortex and cerebellum are accounted for, a marked and general pattern of correlated evolution of the two structures is apparent. One deviation from this general pattern is a relative expansion of the cerebellum in apes and other extractive foragers. The confluence of these comparative patterns, studies of ape foraging skills and social learning, and recent evidence on the cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum, suggest an important role for the cerebellum in the evolution of the capacity for planning, execution and understanding of complex behavioural sequences--including tool use and language. There is no clear separation between sensory-motor and cognitive specializations underpinning such skills, undermining the notion of executive control as a distinct process. Instead, I argue that cognitive evolution is most effectively understood as the elaboration of specialized systems for embodied adaptive control.},

abstract = {As only limited insight into behaviour is available from the archaeological record, much of our understanding of historical changes in human cognition is restricted to identifying changes in brain size and architecture. Using both absolute and residual brain size estimates, we show that hominin brain evolution was likely to be the result of a mix of processes; punctuated changes at approximately 100 kya, 1 Mya and 1.8 Mya are supplemented by gradual within-lineage changes in Homo erectus and Homo sapiens sensu lato. While brain size increase in Homo in Africa is a gradual process, migration of hominins into Eurasia is associated with step changes at approximately 400 kya and approximately 100 kya. We then demonstrate that periods of rapid change in hominin brain size are not temporally associated with changes in environmental unpredictability or with long-term palaeoclimate trends. Thus, we argue that commonly used global sea level or Indian Ocean dust palaeoclimate records provide little evidence for either the variability selection or aridity hypotheses explaining changes in hominin brain size. Brain size change at approximately 100 kya is coincident with demographic change and the appearance of fully modern language. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the external pressures driving encephalization, which will only be filled by novel applications of the fossil, palaeoclimatic and archaeological records.},

abstract = {How does evolution grow bigger brains? It has been widely assumed that growth of individual structures and functional systems in response to niche-specific cognitive challenges is the most plausible mechanism for brain expansion in mammals. Comparison of multiple regressions on allometric data for 131 mammalian species, however, suggests that for 9 of 11 brain structures taxonomic and body size factors are less important than covariance of these major structures with each other. Which structure grows biggest is largely predicted by a conserved order of neurogenesis that can be derived from the basic axial structure of the developing brain. This conserved order of neurogenesis predicts the relative scaling not only of gross brain regions like the isocortex or mesencephalon, but also the level of detail of individual thalamic nuclei. Special selection of particular areas for specific functions does occur, but it is a minor factor compared to the large-scale covariance of the whole brain. The idea that enlarged isocortex could be a "spandrel," a by-product of structural constraints later adapted for various behaviors, contrasts with approaches to selection of particular brain regions for cognitively advanced uses, as is commonly assumed in the case of hominid brain evolution.},

abstract = {Since the last common ancestor shared by modern humans, chimpanzees and bonobos, the lineage leading to Homo sapiens has undergone a substantial change in brain size and organization. As a result, modern humans display striking differences from the living apes in the realm of cognition and linguistic expression. In this article, we review the evolutionary changes that occurred in the descent of Homo sapiens by reconstructing the neural and cognitive traits that would have characterized the last common ancestor and comparing these with the modern human condition. The last common ancestor can be reconstructed to have had a brain of approximately 300-400 g that displayed several unique phylogenetic specializations of development, anatomical organization, and biochemical function. These neuroanatomical substrates contributed to the enhancement of behavioral flexibility and social cognition. With this evolutionary history as precursor, the modern human mind may be conceived as a mosaic of traits inherited from a common ancestry with our close relatives, along with the addition of evolutionary specializations within particular domains. These modern human-specific cognitive and linguistic adaptations appear to be correlated with enlargement of the neocortex and related structures. Accompanying this general neocortical expansion, certain higher-order unimodal and multimodal cortical areas have grown disproportionately relative to primary cortical areas. Anatomical and molecular changes have also been identified that might relate to the greater metabolic demand and enhanced synaptic plasticity of modern human brain's. Finally, the unique brain growth trajectory of modern humans has made a significant contribution to our species' cognitive and linguistic abilities.},

abstract = {There is disagreement in the literature about the exact nature of the phenomenon of empathy. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.},

abstract = {Various social animal species have been noted to inhibit aggressive attacks when a conspecific displays submission cues. Blair (1993) has suggested that humans possess a functionally similar mechanism which mediates the suppression of aggression in the context of distress cues. He has suggested that this mechanism is a prerequisite for the development of the moral/conventional distinction; the consistently observed distinction in subject's judgments between moral and conventional transgressions. Psychopaths may lack this violence inhibitor. A causal model is developed showing how the lack of this mechanism would explain the core behavioural symptoms associated with the psychopathic disorder. A prediction of such a causal model would be that psychopaths should fail to make the moral/conventional distinction. This prediction was confirmed. The implication of this finding for other theories of morality is discussed.},

@article{Swann2012a,
abstract = {Identity fusion is a relatively unexplored form of alignment with groups that entails a visceral feeling of oneness with the group. This feeling is associated with unusually porous, highly permeable borders between the personal and social self. These porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that the personal and social self will combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Furthermore, the strong personal as well as social identities possessed by highly fused persons cause them to recognize other group members not merely as members of the group but also as unique individuals, prompting the development of strong relational as well as collective ties within the group. In local fusion, people develop relational ties to members of relatively small groups (e.g., families or work teams) with whom they have personal relationships. In extended fusion, people project relational ties onto relatively large collectives composed of many individuals with whom they may have no personal relationships. The research literature indicates that measures of fusion are exceptionally strong predictors of extreme pro-group behavior. Moreover, fusion effects are amplified by augmenting individual agency, either directly (by increasing physiological arousal) or indirectly (by activating personal or social identities). The effects of fusion on pro-group actions are mediated by perceptions of arousal and invulnerability. Possible causes of identity fusion--ranging from relatively distal, evolutionary, and cultural influences to more proximal, contextual influences--are discussed. Finally, implications and future directions are considered.},

Recent admixture between Neanderthals and modern humans outside of Africa was proposed as the most parsimonious explanation for this observation. However, the hypothesis of ancient population structure within Africa could not be ruled out as an alternative explanation. We use simulations to test whether the site frequency spectrum, conditioned on a derived Neanderthal and an ancestral Yoruba (African) nucleotide (the doubly conditioned site frequency spectrum [dcfs]), can distinguish between models that assume recent admixture or ancient population structure. We compare the simulations to the dcfs calculated from data taken from populations of European, Chinese, and Japanese descent in the Complete Genomics Diversity Panel. Simulations under a variety of plausible demographic parameters were used to examine the shape of the dcfs for both models. The observed shape of the dcfs cannot be explained by any set of parameter values used in the simulations of the ancient structure model. The dcfs simulations for the recent admixture model provide a good fit to the observed dcfs for non-Africans, thereby supporting the hypothesis that recent admixture with Neanderthals accounts for the greater similarity of Neanderthals to non-Africans than Africans.},

This could be due to interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans when the two groups met subsequent to the emergence of modern humans outside Africa. However, it could also be due to population structure that antedates the origin of Neandertal ancestors in Africa. We measure the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genomes of present-day Europeans and find that the last gene flow from Neandertals (or their relatives) into Europeans likely occurred 37,000-86,000 years before the present (BP), and most likely 47,000-65,000 years ago. This supports the recent interbreeding hypothesis and suggests that interbreeding may have occurred when modern humans carrying Upper Paleolithic technologies encountered Neandertals as they expanded out of Africa.},

Analysis of the assembled sequence unequivocally establishes that the Neandertal mtDNA falls outside the variation of extant human mtDNAs, and allows an estimate of the divergence date between the two mtDNA lineages of 660,000 +/- 140,000 years. Of the 13 proteins encoded in the mtDNA, subunit 2 of cytochrome c oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain has experienced the largest number of amino acid substitutions in human ancestors since the separation from Neandertals. There is evidence that purifying selection in the Neandertal mtDNA was reduced compared with other primate lineages, suggesting that the effective population size of Neandertals was small.},

Currently, four distinct chronologies for the timing of population divergence are available, ranging from the late Middle Pleistocene to the late Early Pleistocene, each based on different interpretations of hominin taxonomy. Genetic data can present an independent estimate of the evolutionary timescale involved, making it possible to distinguish between these competing models of hominin evolution. We analysed five dated Neanderthal mitochondrial genomes, together with those of 54 modern humans, and inferred a genetic chronology using multiple age calibrations. Our mean date estimates are consistent with a process of genetic divergence within an ancestral population, commencing approximately 410-440 ka. These results suggest that a reappraisal of key elements in the Pleistocene hominin fossil record may now be required.},

Here, we review the main brain areas that have been associated with morality at both structural and functional levels and speculate about how it can be studied. Orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices are implicated in emotionally-driven moral decisions, while dorsolateral prefrontal cortex appears to moderate its response. These competing processes may be mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex. Parietal and temporal structures play important roles in the attribution of others' beliefs and intentions. The insular cortex is engaged during empathic processes. Other regions seem to play a more complementary role in morality. Morality is supported not by a single brain circuitry or structure, but by several circuits overlapping with other complex processes. The identification of the core features of morality and moral-related processes is needed. Neuroscience can provide meaningful insights in order to delineate the boundaries of morality in conjunction with moral psychology.},

abstract = {Humans report a wide range of neurobiological rewards following moderate and intense aerobic activity, popularly referred to as the 'runner's high', which may function to encourage habitual aerobic exercise. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous neurotransmitters that appear to play a major role in generating these rewards by activating cannabinoid receptors in brain reward regions during and after exercise. Other species also regularly engage in endurance exercise (cursorial mammals), and as humans share many morphological traits with these taxa, it is possible that exercise-induced eCB signaling motivates habitual high-intensity locomotor behaviors in cursorial mammals. If true, then neurobiological rewards may explain variation in habitual locomotor activity and performance across mammals. We measured circulating eCBs in humans, dogs (a cursorial mammal) and ferrets (a non-cursorial mammal) before and after treadmill exercise to test the hypothesis that neurobiological rewards are linked to high-intensity exercise in cursorial mammals. We show that humans and dogs share significantly increased exercise-induced eCB signaling following high-intensity endurance running. eCB signaling does not significantly increase following low-intensity walking in these taxa, and eCB signaling does not significantly increase in the non-cursorial ferrets following exercise at any intensity. This study provides the first evidence that inter-specific variation in neurotransmitter signaling may explain differences in locomotor behavior among mammals. Thus, a neurobiological reward for endurance exercise may explain why humans and other cursorial mammals habitually engage in aerobic exercise despite the higher associated energy costs and injury risks, and why non-cursorial mammals avoid such locomotor behaviors.},
annote = {Goal-oriented behaviors that impose risks or high energy costs are often motivated by neurobiological rewards, which are thought to condition fitness-enhancing activities (Panksepp et al., 2002)

distance running that include both central effects (improved affect, sense of well being, anxiety reduction, post-exercise calm) and 
peripheral effects (reduced pain sensation) (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004; Ogles and Masters, 2003; Sachs and Pargman, 1979).

A neurobiological reward to encourage exercise may be especially important because high levels of aerobic activity are more energetically costly than walking (Cotes and Meade, 1960; Margaria et al., 1963; Menier and Pugh, 1968)

The hypothesis that neurobiological rewards motivate human endurance exercise (Ekkekakis et al., 2005; Sher, 1998) is consistent with evidence that humans are highly adept endurance athletes (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004; Carrier, 1984):

anatomical specializations and demonstrate endurance athletic performance (e.g. speed and distance traveled at aerobic intensities)

Runner's High:
Dietrich and McDaniel suggested a definition more amenable to hypothesis testing, where the runner's high is a change in any of the following observable phenomena: pain sensation, anxiolysis, sedation or feelings of well being (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004).


Endo-Cannabinnoids:

The two recognized eCBs, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), are endogenous ligands for the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, which were originally identified as the pharmacological targets of the principal psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Piomelli, 2003).

The two eCBs (AEA and 2-AG) are released both centrally and peripherally in an activity-dependent manner to modulate the release of classical neurotransmitters (Piomelli, 2003)

eCBs released within the mesolimbic dopamine system lead to overall activation of dopamine neurons by relieving the influence of inhibitory, CB1-expressing GABAergic terminals onto those neurons (Lupica and Riegel, 2005). This leads to enhanced dopamine release in target areas, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain area involved in behavioral reward (Cheer et al., 2007)

eCBs are thought to act as a ‘hedonic' signal (Mahler et al., 2007), triggering neurobiological rewards that are similar to those described by runners (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004)

contribute to the development of habitual reward-directed behaviors (Gerdeman et al., 2003; Lupica and Riegel, 2005).

Exercise- induced reductions in pain sensation lead to feelings of effortlessness associated with the strict definition of the runner's high and improve exercise performance by allowing individuals to run longer distances (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004)

psychological and analgesic effects of CB receptor activation mirror athletes' descriptions of the neurobiological rewards associated with exercise (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004) (1332)

eCBs are highly lipophilic, which allows them to readily cross the blood–brain barrier (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004; Sparling et al., 2003)

Thus, circulating levels of AEA or 2-AG are thought to lead to central effects because eCBs produced peripherally can cross the blood–brain barrier and activate CB receptors in brain reward centers (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004; Solinas et al., 2006; Willoughby et al., 1997)

Recent work in experimental evolution (i.e. selection experiments in rodents) suggests that eCB-induced rewards for exercise can be a target of natural selection and may explain habitual engagement in voluntary exercise in mammals.

In female mice bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running over 15?years, administration of rimonabant (a selective CB receptor antagonist) led to significantly reduced levels of running compared with administration of a placebo, as well as with control mice given rimonabant (Keeney et al., 2008).

Thus, selection used the eCB system to reward high amounts of voluntary running in these mice (Keeney et al., 2008), and these rewards encouraged increased levels of habitual voluntary exercise. However, it is unknown whether this system is linked to exercise in other mammals



Discussion: 

This is the first study to show that there is inter-specific variation in neurotransmitter signaling following exercise and that this variation may explain differences in habitual locomotor behaviors among mammals

In humans, increased eCB signaling following exercise is significantly correlated with improved PA, confirming the role of eCBs in generating positive psychological effects

these rewards are not simply triggered by locomotion but are tied to higher exercise intensities

eCBs can aid cursorial mammals by improving high-intensity athletic performance through both central and peripheral actions:

Centrally: CB receptors are primarily expressed in presynaptic terminals, where activation by eCBs leads to a decrease in the synaptic release of classical neurotransmitters (Piomelli, 2003) and produces psychological effects similar to those described by runners in this study (Chaperon and Thiebot, 1999; Diaz, 1997; Piomelli, 2003)

Additionally, intravenous injections of eCBs activate CB receptors in the brain and lead to reward-seeking behaviors (e.g. self-administered injections) in animal models (Justinova et al., 2005; Justinova et al., 2011; Solinas et al., 2006; Willoughby et al., 1997).

Improvements in PA such as those measured here are a major factor in human runners' motivation to habitually engage in aerobic exercise (Bryan et al., 2007; Kwan and Bryan, 2010; Schneider et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2008), suggesting that one role for eCB- induced rewards is to encourage a high frequency of aerobic activity. These effects are not limited to elite athletes. Many studies have shown that aerobic exercise has a positive psychological effect in healthy populations of non-athletes (Reed and Ones, 2006)

exercise improves psychological well being in non-athletic individuals with depressive or anxiety disorders (Scully et al., 1998). Thus, these broadly felt rewards are likely essential for the enjoyment of exercise and may explain why mammalian taxa engage in cursorial behaviors despite the higher energy costs and associated injury risks (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004; Johnson et al., 2000; Pinchbeck et al., 2004; Prole, 1976)

Peripherally:
In addition to central effects on psychological state, eCBs may act at peripheral CB receptors to decrease nociceptor activity (Agarwal et al., 2007) and produce exercise-induced analgesia (Sparling et al., 2003).

This reduction in pain sensitivity is an important component of the runner's high (i.e. feelings of effortlessness) as defined by Dietrich and McDaniel (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004), and one that improves aerobic exercise performance by allowing individuals to continue running for long distances

Exercise-induced analgesia is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in both athletes and non-athletes following moderate and high-intensity exercise (Hoffman and Hoffman, 2007; Koltyn, 2002)

eCBs reduce pain throughout the body because peripheral nerves that are active in sensing pain pathways contain dense concentrations of CB receptors (Dietrich and McDaniel, 2004), which function to inhibit the release of neurotransmitters (Gerdeman, 2008; Piomelli, 2003)

Peripheral analgesia by eCBs is also achieved through the actions of CB receptors to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators (Hohmann and Suplita, 2006; Ibrahim et al., 2003)

In addition to acting at peripheral sites, CB receptors are found at central sites implicated in pain modulation such as the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord and the rostral ventromedial medulla of the brainstem (Hohmann et al., 1999; Meng et al., 1998), suggesting that circulating eCBs may also lead to a central reduction in pain perception

neurobiological differences among mammalian taxa may explain variation in their habitual locomotor behaviors


Wired (and built) to run:
humans share many anatomical traits with quadrupedal cursors that improve endurance athletic performance (e.g. increased limb length, increased semi- circular canal size, increased joint surface areas) (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004; Carrier, 1984) 

We suggest that, for tests of evolutionary hypotheses, fit individuals make better models of earlier human groups, as our ancestors lived active hunter–gatherer lifestyles (Malina and Little, 2008)

It is possible that more sedentary groups cannot adequately exercise at the intensities required to elicit a significant eCB elevation, and do not gain similar psychological benefits from exercise at lower intensities. This possible intra- specific variation in physical fitness may explain why some individuals do not enjoy exercise

The fact that running, and endurance exercise in general, remains an enjoyable and psychologically beneficial recreational activity for tens of millions of humans today suggests that we still may respond to a neurobiological trait that evolved early in our lineage},

abstract = {Pain and pleasure are powerful motivators of behaviour and have historically been considered opposites. Emerging evidence from the pain and reward research fields points to extensive similarities in the anatomical substrates of painful and pleasant sensations. Recent molecular-imaging and animal studies have demonstrated the important role of the opioid and dopamine systems in modulating both pain and pleasure. Understanding the mutually inhibitory effects that pain and reward processing have on each other, and the neural mechanisms that underpin such modulation, is important for alleviating unnecessary suffering and improving well-being.},
annote = {Two components of pleasure and pain: sensory and affective.


Dopamine is associated with motivation (wanting), whereas opioid system appears to be associated with experience of pleasure/pain (liking).


The Motivation-Decision Model (Fields 2004):
optimisation of our internal homeostatic balance. 
An unconscious decision process requiring information about the homeostatic state of the individual
(such as inflammation or hunger), sensory input and knowledge about impending threats and available rewards (314)

Pain-plesure dilemmas based on the subjecctive utility:

pain–pleasure dilemmas in which a large reward is gained at the price of a small pain are resolved through the antinociceptive effects of the pleasurable reward 

antinociceptive effects are mediated by the descend-ing pain modulatory system, which is located in the brainstem. This circuit, which consists of excitatory and inhibitory cells, communicates with neurons in the pre-frontal cortex, the hypothalamus and the amygdala to control the nociceptive afferent pathway in the spinal and trigeminal dorsal horn. Opiate drugs and endogenous opioids act on this descending system to produce pharmacological, placebo, stress-induced and pleasure-related analgesia (314).

phasic dopamine has a key role in endogenous analgesia in situations in which reward is expected (316).





Aristotle's Golden Mean:
To maintain homeostasis, animals must aim for
Normal tonic dopamine level
the ‘Golden Mean' — that is, the right balance between pleasure-seeking and pain-avoidance

Two types of dopamine:

--{\textgreater} The responsiveness of the phasic dopamine system (a system which is caused by brief bursts of neuronal firing and relates to reward. Normal phasic dopamine signal

responsiveness to reward cues (318).


Tonic dopamine - the level of extra-synaptic dopamine present at a steady-state concentration in the extracellular space. 

--{\textgreater} Baseline tonic dopamine is thought to enable a number of behavioural processes, many of which are affected in Parkinson's disease (motor control? movement?)

Tonic dopamine levels regulate the responsiveness of phasic dopamine system to salient environmental cues (High tonic dopamine attenuates phasic dopamine release, whereas low tonic dopamine facilitates phasic dopamine firing) (318).

The level of tonic dopamine in the limbic
striatum is in turn modulated by corticostriatal and hippocampal afferents and homeostasis

Phasic Dopamine (affective) and Opioids (sensory): 

the mutual reinforce- ment of phasic dopamine and opioid release is consistent with the idea that dopaminer- gic motivation signalling takes place during preparation for, or consummation of, a pleasurable reward.

The finding that high tonic dopamine activity is associated with both increased pain and decreased pleasure, and that tonic over-activity of the dopa- mine system is known to reduce phasic dopamine and µ-opioid release, further corroborates the idea that interactions between µ-opioids and phasic dopamine signalling mediate pleasure and analgesic effects in the brain.

So, pleasure and well-being takes place when opioids and phasic dopamine associate, i.e. affective and sensory signals click. 

These two neurotransmitter systems are thus likely to mediate the brain's common currency, allowing for action selection based on the comparison

Anhedonia is a major symptom of depres- sion, and several recent papers have sug- gested that it might be related to reductions in dopaminergic neurotransmission that are similar to those that are seen during abstinence of addictive drugs

By contrast, positive mood and cognitive flexibility are thought to arise from a highly responsive phasic dopamine system (318)


Meaning and Motivation-Decision:
As stated in the beginning, closely related to the subjective interpretation of a sensory stimulus is the concept of mean- ing. Meaning allows for many alternative paths to well-being. Consideration of this factor might help to explain the abundance of paradoxical aversive or life-threatening human behaviours found across society that are considered ‘pleasurable'. Even suffering can be rewarding if it has meaning to the sufferer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: How is happiness generated via brain function in lucky individuals who have the good fortune to be happy? Conceptually, well-being or happiness has long been viewed as requiring at least two crucial ingredients: positive affect or pleasure (hedonia) and a sense of meaningfulness or engagement in life (eudaimonia). Science has recently made progress in relating hedonic pleasure to brain function, and so here we survey new insights into how brains generate the hedonic ingredient of sustained or frequent pleasure. We also briefly discuss how brains might connect hedonia states of pleasure to eudaimonia assessments of meaningfulness, and so create balanced states of positive well-being. RESULTS: Notable progress has been made in understanding brain bases of hedonic processing, producing insights into that brain systems that cause and/or code sensory pleasures. Progress has been facilitated by the recognition that hedonic brain mechanisms are largely shared between humans and other mammals, allowing application of conclusions from animal studies to a better understanding of human pleasures. In the past few years, evidence has also grown to indicate that for humans, brain mechanisms of higher abstract pleasures strongly overlap with more basic sensory pleasures. This overlap may provide a window into underlying brain circuitry that generates all pleasures, including even the hedonic quality of pervasive well-being that detaches from any particular sensation to apply to daily life in a more sustained or frequent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Hedonic insights are applied to understanding human well-being here. Our strategy combines new findings on brain mediators that generate the pleasure of sensations with evidence that human brains use many of the same hedonic circuits from sensory pleasures to create the higher pleasures. This in turn may be linked to how hedonic systems interact with other brain systems relevant to self-understanding and the meaning components of eudaimonic happiness. Finally, we speculate a bit about how brains that generate hedonia states might link to eudaimonia assessments to create properly balanced states of positive well-being that approach true happiness.},

"bonded relationships appear to involve two parallel and quite distinct mechanisms—a cognitive mechanism (derivative of the social brain) and an emotionally based form of attachment (often involving a psycho- pharmacological mechanism) (Dunbar, 2010b)" (782).


"the release of endorphins (Keverne et al., 1989; Dunbar, 2010a), provides a psycho-pharmacological mechanism that enables two individuals to build a bonded relationship with some kind of deeply emotional basis... (782)

this is a necessary prerequisite for such individuals to build a more cognitively-based relationship, one that is akin to trust in the sense that individuals are willing to behave altruis- tically towards each other (782)"

"A subsequent factor analysis of the RCI and a number of other verbal and pictorial relationship indices concluded that they clus- ter on just two key dimensions, labelled, respectively, ‘Behaving close' and ‘Feeling close' (Aron et al., 1992). This suggests that intense relationships can be described in terms of a combination of physical proximity (i.e., fre- quency of interaction?) and emotional engagement" (784).

examine correlations between different behavioural measures and use factor analysis to extract a set of dimensions that might reflect these inner states (784).

(Cords {\&} Aureli 2000): with primates, 
COMPATIBILITY - tolerance, affiliation and spatial proximity

VALUE - willingnes to share food, coalitionart support
SECURITY - predictability and consistency of a relationship over time.
The last two are functional criteria, rather than "simple descriptors of relationship quality" (784).


"still missing that ‘inner something' that makes the relationship work and gives rise to tolerance and relationship stability" (784).


"evidence that oxytocin (and/or vasopressin in males) plays a role in facilitating pairbonding in voles (Young {\&} Wang, 2004) has raised the possibility that the emotional component of bonding may have a relatively simple neuroendocrine basis" (785).

"Bondedness is not just a cognitive process, even though cognition may be a necessary component; rather, bonded relationships appear to involve two parallel and quite dis- tinct mechanisms—a cognitive mechanism (derivative of the social brain) and an emotionally based form of attachment (often involving a psycho- pharmacological mechanism) (Dunbar, 2010b)"

Thus, anti-synchrony (as op- posed to the asynchronised behaviour that gives rise to social segregation in ungulates) may be as much a hallmark of a deeply bonded relationship as close synchrony. The problem is more one of finding a suitable index of syn- chrony that reflects the extent to which pairs of individuals coordinate their behaviour. Some variant on the synchrony indices developed to study ungu- late social segregation (e.g., Conradt, 1998b) might, thus, prove profitable. Vocal},

Cluster phase analysis was introduced as a method to assess synchronies between whole teams and between individual players with their team as a function of time, ball possession and field direction. Measures of dispersion (SD) and regularity (sample entropy - SampEn - and cross sample entropy - Cross-SampEn) were used to quantify the magnitude and structure of synchrony. Large synergistic relations within each professional team sport collective were observed, particularly in the longitudinal direction of the field (0.89±0.12) compared to the lateral direction (0.73±0.16, p{\textless}.01). The coupling between the group measures of the two teams also revealed that changes in the synchrony of each team were intimately related (Cross-SampEn values of 0.02±0.01). Interestingly, ball possession did not influence team synchronization levels. In player-team synchronization, individuals tended to be coordinated under near in-phase modes with team behavior (mean ranges between -7 and 5° of relative phase). The magnitudes of variations were low, but more irregular in time, for the longitudinal (SD: 18±3°; SampEn: 0.07±0.01), compared to the lateral direction (SD: 28±5°; SampEn: 0.06±0.01, p{\textless}.05) on-field. Increases in regularity were also observed between the first (SampEn: 0.07±0.01) and second half (SampEn: 0.06±0.01, p{\textless}.05) of the observed competitive game. Findings suggest that the method of analysis introduced in the current study may offer a suitable tool for examining team's synchronization behaviors and the mutual influence of each team's cohesiveness in competing social collectives.},

the competitive group dynamics observed in team sport. While identifying with a sport team/club (either as a player or fan) can often evoke positive experiences (e.g., satisfy the need to belong; Baumeister {\&} Leary, 1995), it can also evoke inter-group rivalries and aggressive acts against members of rival groups (Wann, Haynes, McLean, {\&} Pullen, 2003).

the psycho-physiological response to the success and failure of these groups (who are often located hundreds of miles away and are composed of individuals who many of these fans have never met in real life) can be quite substantial. For instance, the incidence of acute myo- cardial infarction and stroke increases the days after a national team is eliminated from the FIFA World Cup of soccer/football (Wilbert-Lampen et al., 2008) and decreases after winning the championship (Berthier {\&} Boulay, 2003).

dentifyingwithanddefendinga sport teamor clubarenot purely social constructionsdthese dynamics are by-products of psycho- logicalmechanisms that evolved due to the high prevalence of tribal warfare in the EEA; it is estimated that many hunter-gatherer soci- eties hadupwards of a 30e40{\%} male death rate due to tribalwarfare (Keeley, 1996; Pinker, 2011).

Tribal warfare and raiding are hy- pothesized to have selected for mechanisms that motivate in- dividuals to identify with, form, and defend one's in-group, and also the cognitive capacity to discriminate “us” versus “them” (Van Vugt, 2009; Van Vugt {\&} Park, 2009; Winegard {\&} Deaner, 2010)



The Naturalistic Fallacy:
the naturalistic fallacydattempting to derive an “ought” from an “is” (Buss, 1990; Gaulin {\&} McBurney, 2004; Hagen, 2005). For example, youth have evolved mechanisms that underlie play behavior (Geary, 2010), but this does not exclusively mean play behavior is good, just as the existence of evolved mechanisms underlying aggressive behavior does not mean aggressive behavior is good.

Nature-Nurture Dichotomy: generative interaction between the two...
a foundation of evolutionary psychology is that nature and nurture are not opposed. In contrast, they exhibit a non-zero sum relationship (i.e., more nature means more nurture).

learning is only possible because the human species reliably develops numerous evolved psychological learning mechanisms that are specialized for solving specific problems (e.g., grammar acquisition or kin recognition)

Pinker (2004) clarified that “learning itself must be accomplished by innate circuitry, and what is innate is not a set of rigid instructions for behavior but rather programs that take in information from the senses and give rise to new thoughts and actions” (p. 2).

An evolutionary approach does not downplay the human capacity for variable behavior, nor does it downplay humans' powerful capacity to change. Rather, it merely aims to develop explanations of behavior and learning that are biologically plausible.

the genetic fallacy
the mistaken belief that evolved traits are inflexible (Buss, 1990; Gaulin {\&} McBurney, 2004; Hagen, 2005). What is often overlooked is that genetically “determined” evolved mechanisms, including those both below and above the neck, do not imply genetically determined behavior (Hagen, 2005)

Psychological adaptations are computational; in that in- formation is inputted, processed, and results in behavioral output. As these adaptations evolved in ancestral environments they may not be biologically adaptive in current environments

Motivation:
evolutionary approach to motivation posits that humans should possess multiple motivational mechanisms that have specific information processing characteristics

motivational mechanisms are also hypothesized to be universal aspects of human nature, their behavioral outputs are shaped by one's cultural milieu and are contingent on the local social and physical ecology

For example: children's rough-and-tumble play is found across cultures, is more prevalent in males, and there is accumu- lating evidence that such behaviors are, in part, due to levels of prenatal androgen exposure (Berenbaum {\&} Beltz, 2011)

For example, in societies that regularly involve intra-group and inter-group physical aggression (e.g., fighting, tribal warfare), anthropologists have documented relatively more intense rough-and-tumble play, including physically competitive sports. 

Loy and Hesketh (1995) noted that “all Plains Indian tribes were, to greater or lesser degrees, involved in a wide range of warring activities” (p. 80) and that within these societies youth sports were designed to promote physical endurance and aggres- sive physical competition between individuals and groups.


ex-differences in the elicitation of anger (Buss, 1989), social dominance (Sidanius, Levin, Liu, {\&} Pratto, 2000), resistance and noncontact with infectious pathogens (Schaller {\&} Duncan, 2007), mate selection (Botwin, Buss, {\&} Shackleford, 1997), in-group cooperation and out-group enmity (Winegard {\&} Deaner, 2010), and the need to belong (Baumeister {\&}

Aligning with Haidt's position, evidence suggests most cognition occurs outside of consciousness (Bargh {\&} Chartrand, 1999)

researchagendawithamorebalancedfocus on both conscious reasoning and affective processes may be warranted. On this view, specifichypothesesprovidedbyanevolutionary approach tomotivation will be a valuable resource for those aiming to increase exercise behavior

Sex Differences in Sport {\&} Exercise Participation {\&} Adherence
There is also evidence that women and men approach sport in different ways. For example, males report higher competitive and ego orientations (Kavussanu {\&} Ntoumanis, 2003). In 2005, a nation wide survey of sport participation in Canada found that men reported a lack of time as the primary reason for not participating in sport while women reported a lack of interest (Ifedi, 2008)

Four of the five most popular sports Canadian men participate in are largely tribal in nature and involve physical contact: hockey, basketball, baseball, and soccer. In contrast, four of the five most popular sports for Canadian women are relatively more individu- alistic and involve less physical contact: swimming, golf, volleyball, and skiing. Males also exhibit significantly more sport fandom (Dietz-Uhler, Harrick, End, {\&} Jacquemotte, 2000) and experience sport fandom differently (James {\&} Ridinger, 2002)

Sexual selection theory argues that males tend to compete amongst themselves for access to mates (intra- sexual selection), and that females tend to be more selective of their mates than males (intersexual selection) (Andersson, 1994).

Lombardo (2012) hypothesized that sport may serve as both a context to gain status and to display attractive qualities. Specifically, Lombardo proposed that sport functions as a biological lekda context where individuals not only compete to gain status and dominance, which involves learning about rivals and allies, but also allows individuals to display attractive qualities

Once again, differences in ancestral selective forces between
sexes may provide insight, specifically with respect to cooperative hunting and tribal warfare (Lombardo, 2012; Van Vugt, 2009; Van Vugt {\&} Park, 2009; Winegard {\&} Deaner, 2010). Across the vast ma- jority ofhunter-gatherersocieties,males predominantlyparticipated in group-based cooperative hunting, an activity that not only pro- vides heightened status to skilled huntersdand in turn reproductive opportunitiesdbut also influences the genetic fitness of local kin- groups via nutritional resources (Marlowe, 2007)

the above evidence provides indirect, yet objective support for the hypothesis that males have greater competitive orientations. In terms of the popularity of tribal teamsports, the selection pressures for males to successfully navigate cooperative hunting and intergroup warfare and raiding predict males to have elevated preferences for coalitional competition.


Efficacy of implicit and explicit skill acquisition:
Endeavoring to explain why skills learned implicitly may be
more resilient under duress, Reber (1992) developed an ultimate level hypothesis proposing that the continual process of adaptation and degree of functional integration of phylogenetically older sys- tems results in an implicit learning process that may be less error prone than phylogenetically younger explicit learning processes (Reber, 1992). Poolton, Masters, and Maxwell (2007) found empir- ical support for this ultimate level hypothesis and concluded that “We have inherited motor processes from our pre-declarative an- cestors that have potential to be both resilient to fatigue and to the passage of time {\ldots} an evolutionary perspective has provided us useful insight” (p. 466).

Group Dynamics and Sport:
Furthermore, even though many activ- ities are viewed as ‘individual' in nature, themajority are conducted in settings characterized by a high degree of interdependence (e.g., running groups, golf foursomes; Evans, Eys, {\&} Bruner, 2012).

Hazing is defined as “any activity expected of someone joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers, regardless of the person's willingness to participate” (Hoover,1999, p. 8). 

hazing is a relatively modern classification of a much more common and historically consistent practice: initiation rituals. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, the prevalence of hazing across cultures (Allan {\&} Madden, 2008; Groves, Griggs, {\&} Leflay, 2012; Hamilton {\&} Scott, 2012) and more generally of initiation rituals throughout history (Glucklich, 2003)

Are these practices by-products of psychological mechanisms that evolved to solve other adaptive tasks, or are these behaviors actually adaptive?

However, a significant threat to group cooperation is free riding or social loafing (i.e., a potential reduction in effort and/or productivity by individuals who join groups). Although newcomers to a group could increase the fitness of group members, they could also free ride and thereby increase their own fitness at the expense of the fitness of group members, which if sustained would extinguish the benefits of cooperation. Several researchers have hypothesized that initiation rites are ‘honest signals' of group members' commitmentdtheir willingness to pay the costs necessary for group cooperation (Irons, 2001; Sosis, Kress, {\&} Boster, 2007).

“groups that confront the most significant challenges of collective action ... will require the most demanding rituals of their community members in order to deter free-riders from exploiting the benefits attained through collective action” (Sosis et al. 2007: 236)},

At the nearby Bouri site several cut-marked bones also show stone tool use approximately 2.5 Myr ago. Here we report stone-tool-inflicted marks on bones found during recent survey work in Dikika, Ethiopia, a research area close to Gona and Bouri. On the basis of low-power microscopic and environmental scanning electron microscope observations, these bones show unambiguous stone-tool cut marks for flesh removal and percussion marks for marrow access. The bones derive from the Sidi Hakoma Member of the Hadar Formation. Established (40)Ar-(39)Ar dates on the tuffs that bracket this member constrain the finds to between 3.42 and 3.24 Myr ago, and stratigraphic scaling between these units and other geological evidence indicate that they are older than 3.39 Myr ago. Our discovery extends by approximately 800,000 years the antiquity of stone tools and of stone-tool-assisted consumption of ungulates by hominins; furthermore, this behaviour can now be attributed to Australopithecus afarensis.},

@article{Crompton2008a,
abstract = {Based on our knowledge of locomotor biomechanics and ecology we predict the locomotion and posture of the last common ancestors of (a) great and lesser apes and their close fossil relatives (hominoids); (b) chimpanzees, bonobos and modern humans (hominines); and (c) modern humans and their fossil relatives (hominins). We evaluate our propositions against the fossil record in the context of a broader review of evolution of the locomotor system from the earliest hominoids of modern aspect (crown hominoids) to early modern Homo sapiens. While some early East African stem hominoids were pronograde, it appears that the adaptations which best characterize the crown hominoids are orthogrady and an ability to abduct the arm above the shoulder - rather than, as is often thought, manual suspension sensu stricto. At 7-9 Ma (not much earlier than the likely 4-8 Ma divergence date for panins and hominins, see Bradley, 2008) there were crown hominoids in southern Europe which were adapted to moving in an orthograde posture, supported primarily on the hindlimb, in an arboreal, and possibly for Oreopithecus, a terrestrial context. By 7 Ma, Sahelanthropus provides evidence of a Central African hominin, panin or possibly gorilline adapted to orthogrady, and both orthogrady and habitually highly extended postures of the hip are evident in the arboreal East African protohominin Orrorin at 6 Ma. If the traditional idea that hominins passed through a terrestrial 'knuckle-walking' phase is correct, not only does it have to be explained how a quadrupedal gait typified by flexed postures of the hindlimb could have preadapted the body for the hominin acquisition of straight-legged erect bipedality, but we would have to accept a transition from stem-hominoid pronogrady to crown hominoid orthogrady, back again to pronogrady in the African apes and then back to orthogrady in hominins. Hand-assisted arboreal bipedality, which is part of a continuum of orthograde behaviours, is used by modern orangutans to forage among the small branches at the periphery of trees where the core hominoid dietary resource, ripe fruit, is most often to be found. Derivation of habitual terrestrial bipedality from arboreal hand-assisted bipedality requires fewer transitions, and is also kinematically and kinetically more parsimonious.},

The find includes many previously unknown skeletal elements from the Pliocene hominin record, including a hyoid bone that has a typical African ape morphology.

abstract = {We propose that the crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species is the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions: shared intentionality. Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with others and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.},

a special kind of shared mo- tivation in truly collaborative activities in the form of a shared goal – each interactant has goals with respect to the other's goals – a crucial point to which we return later in dif- ferentiating human collaboration and intentional communi- cation from the social interactions of other primate species. (680)

"both collaborators must choose their own action plan in the activity in light of (and coordinated with) the other's action plan: my role is to hold the box steady while you cut it open. This requires that each participant cognitively rep- resent both roles of the collaboration in a single represen- tational format – holistically, from a “bird's-eye view,” as it were – thus enabling role reversal and mutual helping."

abstract = {The evolution of social monogamy has intrigued biologists for over a century. Here, we show that the ancestral condition for all mammalian groups is of solitary individuals and that social monogamy is derived almost exclusively from this social system. The evolution of social monogamy does not appear to have been associated with a high risk of male infanticide, and paternal care is a consequence rather than a cause of social monogamy. Social monogamy has evolved in nonhuman mammals where breeding females are intolerant of each other and female density is low, suggesting that it represents a mating strategy that has developed where males are unable to defend access to multiple females.},

abstract = {Although common in birds, social monogamy, or pair-living, is rare among mammals because internal gestation and lactation in mammals makes it advantageous for males to seek additional mating opportunities. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of social monogamy among mammals: as a male mate-guarding strategy, because of the benefits of biparental care, or as a defense against infanticidal males. However, comparative analyses have been unable to resolve the root causes of monogamy. Primates are unusual among mammals because monogamy has evolved independently in all of the major clades. Here we combine trait data across 230 primate species with a Bayesian likelihood framework to test for correlated evolution between monogamy and a range of traits to evaluate the competing hypotheses. We find evidence of correlated evolution between social monogamy and both female ranging patterns and biparental care, but the most compelling explanation for the appearance of monogamy is male infanticide. It is only the presence of infanticide that reliably increases the probability of a shift to social monogamy, whereas monogamy allows the secondary adoption of paternal care and is associated with a shift to discrete ranges. The origin of social monogamy in primates is best explained by long lactation periods caused by altriciality, making primate infants particularly vulnerable to infanticidal males. We show that biparental care shortens relative lactation length, thereby reducing infanticide risk and increasing reproductive rates. These phylogenetic analyses support a key role for infanticide in the social evolution of primates, and potentially, humans.},

Although evidence for exploitation of other resources (small mammals, birds, fish, shellfish, and plants) has been found at certain Neanderthal sites, these are typically dismissed as unusual exceptions. The general view suggests that Neanderthal diet may broaden with time, but that this only occurs sometime after 50,000 years ago. We present evidence, in the form of lithic residue and use-wear analyses, for an example of a broad-based subsistence for Neanderthals at the site of Payre, Ard{\`{e}}che, France (beginning of MIS 5/end of MIS 6 to beginning of MIS 7/end of MIS 8; approximately 125-250,000 years ago). In addition to large terrestrial herbivores, Neanderthals at Payre also exploited starchy plants, birds, and fish. These results demonstrate a varied subsistence already in place with early Neanderthals and suggest that our ideas of Neanderthal subsistence are biased by our dependence on the zooarchaeological record and a deep-seated intellectual emphasis on big game hunting.},

abstract = {A quarter century has passed since the first publication of the evolutionary discordance hypothesis, according to which departures from the nutrition and activity patterns of our hunter-gatherer ancestors have contributed greatly and in specifically definable ways to the endemic chronic diseases of modern civilization. Refinements of the model have changed it in some respects, but anthropological evidence continues to indicate that ancestral human diets prevalent during our evolution were characterized by much lower levels of refined carbohydrates and sodium, much higher levels of fiber and protein, and comparable levels of fat (primarily unsaturated fat) and cholesterol. Physical activity levels were also much higher than current levels, resulting in higher energy throughput. We said at the outset that such evidence could only suggest testable hypotheses and that recommendations must ultimately rest on more conventional epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies. Such studies have multiplied and have supported many aspects of our model, to the extent that in some respects, official recommendations today have targets closer to those prevalent among hunter-gatherers than did comparable recommendations 25 years ago. Furthermore, doubts have been raised about the necessity for very low levels of protein, fat, and cholesterol intake common in official recommendations. Most impressively, randomized controlled trials have begun to confirm the value of hunter-gatherer diets in some high-risk groups, even as compared with routinely recommended diets. Much more research needs to be done, but the past quarter century has proven the interest and heuristic value, if not yet the ultimate validity, of the model.},

abstract = {The derived proportions of the human hand may provide supportive buttressing that protects the hand from injury when striking with a fist. Flexion of digits 2-5 results in buttressing of the pads of the distal phalanges against the central palm and the palmar pads of the proximal phalanges. Additionally, adduction of the thenar eminence to abut the dorsal surface of the distal phalanges of digits 2 and 3 locks these digits into a solid configuration that may allow a transfer of energy through the thenar eminence to the wrist. To test the hypothesis of a performance advantage, we measured: (1) the forces and rate of change of acceleration (jerk) from maximum effort strikes of subjects striking with a fist and an open hand; (2) the static stiffness of the second metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joint in buttressed and unbuttressed fist postures; and (3) static force transfer from digits 2 and 3 to digit 1 also in buttressed and unbuttressed fist postures. We found that peak forces, force impulses and peak jerk did not differ between the closed fist and open palm strikes. However, the structure of the human fist provides buttressing that increases the stiffness of the second MCP joint by fourfold and, as a result of force transfer through the thenar eminence, more than doubles the ability of the proximal phalanges to transmit 'punching' force. Thus, the proportions of the human hand provide a performance advantage when striking with a fist. We propose that the derived proportions of hominin hands reflect, in part, sexual selection to improve fighting performance.},

abstract = {Although variation in individual lifestyle and genotype are important factors in explaining individual variation in the risk of developing obesity in an obesogenic environment, there is growing evidence that developmentally plastic processes also contribute. These effects are mediated at least in part through epigenetic processes. These developmental pathways do not directly cause obesity but rather alter the risk of an individual developing obesity later in life. At least two classes of developmental pathway are involved. The mismatch pathway involves the evolved adaptive responses of the developing organism to anticipated future adverse environments, which have maladaptive consequences if the environment is mismatched to that predicted. This pathway can be cued by prenatal undernutrition or stresses that lead the organism to forecast an adverse future environment and change its developmental trajectory accordingly. As a result, individuals develop with central and peripheral changes that increase their sensitivity to an obesogenic environment. It provides a model for how obesity emerges in populations in rapid transition, but also operates in developed countries. There is growing experimental evidence that this pathway can be manipulated by, for example, postnatal leptin exposure. Secondly, maternal diabetes, maternal obesity and infant overfeeding are associated with a greater risk of later obesity. Early life offers a potential point for preventative intervention.},

abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupl{\"{a}}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

"Maynard Smith {\&} Szathmary conceived of the space of biological possibility as evolving" (4)




Previous Conception: 
"Possibility expanding innovations" 
Powered by invention and innovation (Parker 2003, Lane 2009) (4): Innovation (sight, movement, hot blood, photosynthesis etc) has led to great phylogenetic diversity: photosynthesis for example allowed forvast numbers of new species, "Each expands ecospace" (4)
Useful but STATIC (4)

Maynard Smith {\&} Szathmary's Dynamic Approach: "key events are changes in the evolutionary process itself" (4) "evolution upgrades itself" (4)
(Godfrey-Smith 2009) 

Change in
1. "Mechanisms of hereditary-where richer and more accurate of the intergenerational flow of information evolve" (4)

2. "Levels of biological individuality" "an evolutionary change after which previously independent entities now reproduce together, sharing their evolutionary fate." (5)

3. "Generation of variation" (5): generative and representational capacity of language, seeing a close analogy with the ingormational capacity of genes." (5)


The Major Transitions: 
"The major transitions are episodes in which the vertical complexity of life has increased through the transformation of a collection or group into a collective" (9)


"What was it about the early-transition population structure and environment that made selection for cooperation so powerful that agents did not just evolve to cooperate but evolved a ballistic commitment to cooperate, giving up the capacity to reproduce independently?" (11)

"complex multicelled organisms exist only because there are developmental cycles in which key structures of adult organisms are rebuilt from scratch in the new generation." (11)

Scott Gilbert (2001): "outlines a program for integrating developmental biology with ecology, taking into account the ecological influences on development" (12) 


Chapter 2 - Brett Calcott: Alternative Patterns of Explanation for Major Transitions

(major trans.) "are special because they changed what was subsequently possible to evolve" (35)

Why are they similar and how can we make such claims?

Focus on the mechanisms for transitions:

most identify the common mechanism as "an especially potent form of multilevel selection; potent enough to suppress the perenial threat of defection." (35)

there are different...patterns, of explanation in biology: proximate and ultimate explanations (Mayr 1961), Tinbergen's four questions (Tinbergen 1963). 

In this sense different patterns of explanation are applicable to kinds of ev. change identified as Major Transitions (36).

Focus on single Major Transition: the evolution of multicellularity in Volvox carteri (36)

Explanation traditionally focussed on "cooperation and the levels of selection" (36)

Manipulationist account: "we explain some target phenomenon by showing what it depends on, and by showing the structure of this dependence" (36) eg How a Kangaroo Jumps

"These various factors (difference makers in new levels of organisation) - such as relatedness and iterated interactions—are thought to underwrite the stability of cooperation because manipulating these factors in simple models can switch the evo.utionary outcome from noncooperative to cooperative behaviour" (38)

"these models, like many others in evolutionary biology, abstract away from biological details" (39):

generalisation on the unit of the individual (sometimes cells, sometimes ants or bees)...generalisation accross a broad domain, and therefore applicable to multicellularity and eusociality. (39)








Maynard Smith {\&} Szathmary: defining feature of Maj Trans is: "the way that information is transmitted between generations" (1995: 6).



V.cateri:

Explanation 1: Conflict Mediation
(Michod 1999)
2 genes:
1. Cooperation (C) or Defection (D)
2. Germline (M) or no germline (m)

CM: "putting aside a set of slowly reproducing cells for a germline concentrates most defector mutations in the somatic line, who thus have no long-term ecolutionary future. So the evolution of a split between germ and soma helps stabilize cooperation, and selects for the evolution of cooperation cell groups rather than individual living cells." (40)

"a split between germ and somatic line prevents the accumulation of defectors in the population...the advent of germline allocation is thus a difference-maker, whose manipulation affects the evolutionary trajectory of the population, increasing the probablility of a transition to a new level of organisation" (40)


Explanation 2: Generating Benefit 
(Solari, Nedelcu, Michod 2003): how does group behaviour generate benefit? (41)

Green Algae: "increased size allows more phosphate to be stored in the intracellular matrix" (41)

The more algae hang out together the heavier the organisation becomes, which leads to the Flagellation constraint: algae needs to stay afloat and reproduce at the same time, division of labour between cells allows for this need to be satisfied and therefore increased fitness of the organism.

getting bigger requires division of labour between germ and somatic cells.

Explanation 3: Origins of Traits (Kirk 2005)

"evolutionary pathway leading from a unicellular ancestor to multicellular organisms with a division of labor between different cell types." (2005: 299)

12 steps include:
-Partical inversion of the embryo
-organismic polarity
-full division of labor between germ {\&} soma
-bifurcated cell division program

"how a progressive set of small changes could produce the differences between ancestral and derived phenotypes" (42)

"It explains the origins of new phenotypic functions that, in this case, were esssential for the transition to multicellularity" (42)


"What we need is a third way to make generalisations, one that identifies similarities across individual-level properties that are not reliant on common descent." (47)

-homologies: shared ind traits due to relatedness
-analogies: shared ind traits due to other reasons: "forced moves" and "good tricks" (Dennett 1995), the universality of physical constraints: the ways in which the world of organisms bumps against a non-biological reality" (Vogel 1988).

eg.Animals: "a globally optimal system that minimizes the costs of the construction and maintenance of the fluid transport system" (47) (LaBarbera 1990)

generalisations regarding ind-level properties "rely on a much more heterogeneous set of facts" (48)

"Nor is this abstraction dependent on a single general factor"

"these cases require discovering the particular physical or organizational details that force particular solutions, or by recognizing what simple, effective solutions are available to problems that repeatedly occur across many organisms" (48)

A richer Understanding of Maj. Trans.

Ind. plasticity and link to division of labour:
"they explain the origin of particular properties of the higher-level individuals in terms of the prior abilities of lower-level ind." (49)

"If such analogies identify difference-makers that underwrite the stability or complexity of social structures in general, then these properties—like those identified by investigations into the stability of cooperation—can help us understand how new levels of organization evolve" (49).

Tinbergen (1963): "different kinds of explanations can constrain and inform each other (49)

population-level abstracts away from phenotypic detail (49)
Eg. Solari et al with explanation of why size is important for V.cateri, not just being in a group for the sake of it. (49) But the problem of "defection is ignored—the individuals making up the collective are simply assumed to cooperate perfectly: "what one explanation assumes, the other explains" (49)

In this study, we outline this claim and then take issue with it. We argue that the focus on soft inheritance has led to a conflation of proximate and ultimate causation, which has in turn obscured key questions about biological organization and calibration across the life span to maximize average lifetime inclusive fitness. We illustrate this by presenting hypotheses that we believe incorporate the core phenomena of soft inheritance and will aid in understanding them.},

abstract = {The Modern Synthesis (MS) is the current paradigm in evolutionary biology. It was actually built by expanding on the conceptual foundations laid out by its predecessors, Darwinism and neo-Darwinism. For sometime now there has been talk of a new Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES), and this article begins to outline why we may need such an extension, and how it may come about. As philosopher Karl Popper has noticed, the current evolutionary theory is a theory of genes, and we still lack a theory of forms. The field began, in fact, as a theory of forms in Darwin's days, and the major goal that an EES will aim for is a unification of our theories of genes and of forms. This may be achieved through an organic grafting of novel concepts onto the foundational structure of the MS, particularly evolvability, phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, complexity theory, and the theory of evolution in highly dimensional adaptive landscapes.},

abstract = {Recent findings in neuroscience have shown differential patterns in brain activity in response to similar stimuli and activities across cultural and social differences. This calls for a framework to understand how such differences may come to be implemented in brains and neurons. Based on strands of research in social anthropology, we argue that human practices are characterized by particular patterns, and that participating in these patterns orders how people perceive and act in particular group- and context-specific ways. This then leads to a particular patterning of neuronal processes that may be detected using e.g. brain imaging methods. We illustrate this through (a) a classical example of phoneme perception (b) recent work on performance in experimental game play. We then discuss these findings in the light of predictive models of brain function. We argue that a 'culture as patterned practices' approach obviates a rigid nature-culture distinction, avoids the problems involved in conceptualizing 'culture' as a homogenous grouping variable, and suggests that participating as a competent participant in particular practices may affect both the subjective (first person) experience and (third person) objective measures of behavior and brain activity.},

annote = {        Evolution:        
        
Recently, Harrison (2001) defined evolution as “change over time via descent with with modification."        
                  
Jean-Baptiste Lamark (1744-1829):  "Internal force" whereby organisms produced offspring different from themselves, "such that when the changes had accumulated over many generations the lineage would be visibly transformed, perhaps enough to be a new species" (7)
                  
"Inheritance"         
"the theory does not require any conscious striving on the part of the organism a only some flexibility in individual development and the inheritance of acquired characters." (8)
        
"Variation is “directed” in this theory because the offspring tend to differ from their parents in the direction of characteristics acquired by their parents." (13)
        
Darwin:
                  
Beagle voyage (1832-37)
Geographic variation in Galapagos finches:  species can change...
        
"It was equally evident that neither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the organisms [an allusion to Lamarck], could account for the innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully adapted to their habits of life." Darwin in Ridley (10)
        
In the           "struggle for existence favourable variations would tend to be preserved"                 
        
-Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913)
-Thomas Henry Huxley: Defender of natural selection against religious attack
-German biologists followed: Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) phylogenetic pedigrees (12).
        
Evolution was not "inherently or automatically progressive" (12)
        
Darwin lacked theory of heredity:
"Darwin preferred a “blending” theory of inheritance, in which the offspring blend their parental attributes; for example, if a red male mated with a white female, and inheritance “blended,” the offspring would be pink (12)."
                  (Here the blending theory was reasonably intuitive, lacking the key building blocks of random genetic variation).
                  NATURAL SELECTION / EVOLUTION is NON-RANDOM:  it does not occur by chance.  genetic variation occurs by chance, natural selection occurs based on an organism's ability to survive and reporduce in a given environment.
        
        
Medelism:
        
William Bateson and Hugo de Vries: macromutations
Bateson's discovery discontinuous variation exposed the error of directed mutation.
        
Biometricians:
Karl Pearson et al: "studied small, rather than large, differences between individuals and developed statistical tech- niques to describe how frequency distributions of measurable characters (such as height) passed from parent to offspring population." (14)
        
                  
The Modern Synthesis:
                
1918: R.A. Fisher: "Fisher demonstrated there that all the results known to the biometricians could be derived from Mendelian principles." (15)
        
        
Overthrow of Mayr's "Typological species concept" (Type-Deviant) (18)
