\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 In this chapter I analyse the predictions of this dissertation in light of ethnographic evidence collected with the Beijing Men\rquote s rugby team. I observe evidence in which the contours of generalisable cognitive mechanisms relevant to a relationship between joint action and social cohesion are visible. I identify three core areas of analysis. First, athletes pay close attention to their performance of joint action requirements specific to rugby union. In particular, I notice that violation of athletes\rquote  expectations around joint action, both positive and negative, is a source of strong emotional response with implications for processes of group formation. Second, ethnographic observations reveal that the experience of \ldblquote team click\rdblquote  is a prominent experience in joint action associated with rugby, and appears to be connected in athletes\rquote  reasoning to concepts of team cohesion. Third, I identify evidence of social bonding in processes of group formation. In addition to these three core areas of ethnographic evidence, I also flag the possibility that these three processes are moderated by within-group variation in technical competence, personality type, injury, and athlete experience of fatigue and exertion in exercise. I conclude this chapter by considering how these ethnographic data could be combined with existing theory and evidence and operationalised in further empirical studies beyond this specific ethnographic setting.\par

\pard\plain\s3\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs32\sl240\slmult1 \sb240 \fi0 3  Introduction\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Having described the details of this cultural terrain in the previous Chapter (Chapter 5), the contours generalisable cognitive mechanisms relevant to the predictions of this dissertation become more visible. I identify three key categories of athlete experience\emdash 1) perceptions of performance in joint action, 2) feelings relating to \ldblquote team click\rdblquote , and 3) processes of group membership\emdash which I argue are relevant to the hypothesised relationship between joint action and social bonding, as well as the hypothesised mediating role of team click in this relationship. I also outline evidence for possible moderating variables of these relationships, such as technical competence, personality type, injury, and fatigue. I conclude the chapter by summarising and discussing the results, with a particular focus on how these observations could be operationalised in further experimental studies with a larger sample of athletes beyond the Beijing men\rquote s team.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Athletes appear to develop strong subjective perceptions of individual and team performance, based on attention to specific technical components of rugby game play. On the one hand, athletes display evidence of anxiety when expectations around individual and team performance are negatively violated. When the same expectations concerning individual and team performance are positively violated, athletes are noticeably exhilarated, energised, and motivated. Data collected in this ethnography suggest that more junior athletes appear more emotionally volatile when expressing perceptions of individual or team performance, such that both performance related anxiety and exhilaration appears to be more pronounced in junior athletes than senior athletes. More senior athletes, by contrast, display the ability to relate to perceptions of individual and team performance expectations with more personal agency and emotional control. More senior athletes talk in terms of an ability to strategically mitigate the costs of physical exertion and injury risk of joint action in rugby, whereas more junior athletes talk in less personal agency about their experience of individual and team performance. These results suggest that perceptions of team and individual performance in joint action are formulated in relation to specific components of team and individual performance in joint action, as well as more general team and individual expectations structured by the specific team context, social norms, and institutional constraints.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Athletes describe a number of phenomenological dimensions to optimal team performance (team click), including \ldblquote tacit understanding\rdblquote  between teammates ({\i moqi} \u195?\u169?\u194?\u187?\u194?\u732?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u165?\u194?\u8216?), \ldblquote team atmosphere,\rdblquote  \u195?\u175?\u194?\u188?\u194?\u710?{\i qichang} \u195?\u166?\u194?\u176?\u194?\u8221?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u339?\u194?\u186?) and general order and structure to team coordination. The data reveal within-group variation in the way athletes communicate team click: more junior athletes talk about team coordination in a more general and emotional way, whereas more senior athletes talk with a more restrained but more specific understanding of the dimensions and factors required in order to achieve peak team performance. In regards to dimensions of social bonding, athletes appear to prioritise feelings of emotional support and a perception of a shared goal between teammates, as well as a level of personal connection to team roles and team identity. Testimonies of team identity vary from the initial excitement and positivity of new arrivals towards, to the realisation of irreversible attachment to rugby of middle-rung athletes, to the out-and-out identity fusion between senior athletes and the practice of rugby, whereby athletes recognise that their self concept is inextricably linked with rugby and the Temple Institute.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Finally, contained within the collected data is evidence that individual differences may moderate relationships between perceptions of joint action, team click, and social bonding. Namely, an athlete\rquote s experience and competence with the technical and social dimensions of joint action of rugby at the Temple Institute may impact upon the ways in which they formulate and respond to expectations surrounding and team performance. Individual differences in technical competence may also have flow-on effects for the formulation of feelings concerning team click and social bonding. It appears that individual personality types may moderate perceptions of performance in joint action, as well as feelings of team click and social bonding. In addition, other factors such as an athlete\rquote s injury status, and the level of fatigue and exertion experienced in joint action scenarios of rugby may impact on perceptions of performance, feelings of team click, and social bonding. These individual differences should be considered in the design of quantitative studies to test the relationship between joint action, team click, and social bonding.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 In this results section, I outline ethnographic evidence according to the theoretical predictions set out in this dissertation concerning joint action and social bonding. Results are divided into three sections: 1) perceptions of performance in joint action, 2) team click, and 3) group membership\par
\pard\plain\s4\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs32\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 4.1  Perceptions of performance in joint action\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Unsurprisingly, ethnographic observations revealed that perceptions of performance of on-field requirements of rugby were a central dimension to athletes\rquote  experience of the rugby program at the Institute. As explained in the previous section, most of the athletes in the program at the Institute transitioned from other sports, or otherwise had no specific background in sport before coming to the Institute. Rugby\rquote s minnow status in China means that its technical requirements are not widely known or understood. Thus, from a very low base of prior knowledge, athletes are forced to develop technical competence in rugby and a fluency in the social environment of the team. The ability to effectively coordinate behaviour with others, both on and off the field, is therefore crucial to an athlete\rquote s ability to navigate the rugby program at the Institute and access the incentives available.\par
\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 4.1.1  Team Awareness\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 During interviews, within the general theme of the costs and benefits of adherence to rugby, I asked athletes what they found to be \ldblquote the most difficult part of rugby.\rdblquote  20 of the 26 athletes interviewed responded directly to the question, and all interpreted it as a question about rugby\rquote s technical technical demands. As unruly undergrad Fang Chao summarised well:\par
{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 The hardest thing about rugby is all of the small details. Rugby is such a comprehensive sport, and playing in a real game is very different from training. I remember when was playing a tournament in 2014, at the time I had only just started training (for rugby). As soon as I took the field my whole brain was blank. Now I am a bit better, my vision is broader. \par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 Responses indicate that athletes perceive the on-field joint action demands of rugby the most difficult. 11 athletes cited an aspect of rugby that related to on-field coordination of behaviour in joint action, such as decision making in attack, \ldblquote awareness\rdblquote  or vision in game play, coordinating running lines, executing planned plays, and so on. Seven athletes cited aspects of individual performance, such as tackling, speed in defence, footwork in attack. The remaining two athletes cited both an aspect that was related to coordination of behaviours with others, as well as an aspect of individual performance. As Wang Zhenfeng, a tall and extremely talented (but inexperienced) senior athlete, explained:\par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 Interview data suggest that the technical requirements of rugby pose a psychological challenge for athletes. Many enter the Institute without any prior experience of rugby and its technical and social requirements, and are forced to develop these skills. Athletes appear to be slightly more fixated on the difficulties associated with coordinating with others in on-line, \ldblquote in the moment\rdblquote  joint action. Concerns about individual level components of performance such as tackling and side stepping are also prominent concerns. These results are predictable given the facts that 1) the complexity of joint action demands of rugby create high levels of uncertainty, and 2) athletes have very limited experience of these complex technical demands, with most beginning their relationship with rugby at the age of high school or university. Team awareness certainly takes time to develop.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 A combination of interview, observational, and survey data suggest that junior athletes may on average experience greater levels of pressure and anxiety around performance. As discussed in the section above, many newcomers transition individual sports over to team sports and have very little background in interactional team sports. As such, athletes are unfamiliar not only with the specific joint action demands of rugby, but also the norms of group membership associated with the rugby team (see Chapter 5, Section X HYPERLINK). In his interview, Su Hailiang reflected on the feeling of being a new athlete without any foundation:\par

But if for example the coach gives you added pressure, if the coach gives you a requirement, and you need to on the field, the more you think about it the easier it becomes to make mistakes. I feel like the pressure from the Coach is relatively big. \par

When I asked coaches and athletes about this experience, the term {\i neijiu} (\u195?\u165?\u194?\u8224?\u194?\u8230?\u195?\u167?\u194?\u8211?\u194?\u353?) was often used to describe the sensation. Neijiu translates roughly to socially-derived guilt or shame. The use of this term in particular suggested that anxiety around performance contained an important social dimension.\par

As I will explain in the following, I observed senior athletes adopt different strategies to deal with the experience of team and individual performance.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 While some (predominantly junior) athletes appear to shoulder personal responsibility for team performance in a way that leads to the feeling of guilt and prolonged rumination, at the same time I also noticed that other athletes, predominantly senior athletes, would find ways of deflecting such responsibility for performance and thus avoid the need to reconcile dissonance between the quality of their own performance and shared expectations.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 After a few weeks at the Institute eating meals and talking largely to the senior athletes, it became clear that it was common pratice to criticise the lack of motivation and commitment of the more junior athletes, particularly the unruly undergraduates who had just started university at BSU. In a sense, senior athletes used these athletes and their vices of computer games and girlfriends as scapegoats for poor on-field performance.\par

{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 MHT: Often when we\rquote re in the dormitory when I can\rquote t put up with their behaviour I tell them its like this or its like that...but the junior athletes very rarely come and find us for advice, very few are actively motivated to study themselves. Its always us (senior athletes) who are telling them what to do...always on the field calling them out, they rarely come and talk to us personally. But I am not like that, I used to love finding senior athletes, and I also like watching footage of rugby games, replaying each bit of the game.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \li512\ri512\fi0 MHT: Yes, I really want them to improve, work with them for mutual benefit. But the spirit for play in this group (of junior athletes) is so strong! China\emdash I don\rquote t know if you guys from overseas are like this\emdash but all they want to do is play games, they don\rquote t take the initiative to learn, rarely do they grab a computer and watch some (rugby) footage...I don\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?t know how they understand (the situation). My understanding is, if I don\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?t have anything else to then I\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?ll watch some rugby footage. I rely on my awareness (conscientiousness). I am quite a classic example of a conscientiousness athlete here. Chubs though (referring to his roomamate)! His phone has rugby footage on it, there are games on there, and movies, but unless I insist that he watches it he doesn\rquote t watch any of the rugby footage, rarely do they watch any rugby footage. They are not conscientiousness at all. We Chinese, our conscientiousness compared to you folk, our conscientiousness is pretty bad, even my awareness is bad. \par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 It was interesting to see that while Lu Zhongsheng was a senior athlete, he was by no means the most competent of the senior athletes, and from my perspective had serious technical deficiencies in his game, as Lu Peng drew public attention to one lunch time in the canteen (see Chapter 5 Section X HYPERLINK). Indeed, as Lu Zhongsheng himself admitted in the same interview, before being catapulted to the first team after the men\rquote s team was resurrected 2014, Lu himself was in the position that the junior athletes are in now, which is perhaps why he was able to speak with such energy as to the experience of the junior athletes he was criticising. Ma Haitao, too, was a a relatively unmotivated member of the team before he was elevated to the first team in 2014. This reminded me of the irony contained in senior athlete coach Lu Peng\rquote s criticism of the junior athletes and their obsession with computer games. Lu was by far the most animated meal time commentator on the computer games that the team all played. It was clear that he spent a lot of his spare time outside of training playing these games on his computer, phone, or at internet cafes close to the Institute. Rarely did the senior athletes who were critical of the junior athletes at the same time call in to question the role that they themselves played in adding to or subtracting from collective performance.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 For these reasons, I could not help but interpret senior athlete\rquote s criticisms of junior athletes as a strategy in which they were able to deflect responsibility away from themselves\emdash in a sense, it was a practice of saving face in the context of a team that had experienced a dramatic fall from grace and was clearly not performing to the best of its collective ability. The likelihood of this interpretation was reinforced when I also heard other senior athletes produce more measured and circumspect assessments of the junior athletes. Wang Wei, for example, offered his much more balanced assessment:\par

But I guess people have their own ideas, their own conceptions. Because of personalities, you can\rquote t force him, you can\rquote t make strong demands that they do things in this way or that, you need to just need to see how they themselves respond: we\rquote ve already talked to you about this issue, if you do it or not its up to you. If when you get to being a senior apprentice, and the younger apprentices don\rquote t listen to you, then you need to remember to think that at the time when older brothers were instructing you didn\rquote t listen...on the field I actually understand myself as a junior athlete, I don\rquote t think of myself as so senior or anything... Playing rugby, you know, we are all in different phases (of development). But sometimes when you\rquote re playing you get anxious, and occasionally you\rquote ll yell at the junior team mates and criticise them. But you need to play rugby with an encouraging method, you still need to be aware of your attitude. \par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 In contrast to junior athletes, many of whom were still in the process of familiarising themselves with the technical requirements of rugby, senior athletes indicated both familiarity and a capacity to be strategic and selective with their approach to the on field requirements of rugby. When I asked senior athlete Ma Haitao, for example, about how he approaches the physiological fitness costs associated with rugby, Ma responded:\par
{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 It depends on the situation. In a game, if the score is close then I will be one kind of mindset, if we are ahead then I will be of another mindset, if we\rquote re behind then I will be in yet another mindset. When the scores are close and we can come back or if we\rquote re in front by only a little bit then will persevere. But if we\rquote re in front by a lot then for the one minute remaining in the game, I\rquote ll start to think about the next game, and I won\rquote t persevere. Now if the game has just started, no matter how tired I am I will of course persevere. If we\rquote re behind, no matter what time in the match it is, I will grit my teeth and persevere...I just want to win, its about just not losing, its that simple. \par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Flow State} I administered the nine-item Flow State scale after three training sessions. In the first training session, athletes participated in a common aerobic fitness test known as the \ldblquote Beep Test.\rdblquote  The Beep Test involves requires athletes to run a series of 22-metre shuttles for approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on how long each athlete survives in the test. The Beep Test involves no direct joint action or interaction between athletes. Athletes did, however, run the test at the same time, side-by-side (as per convention). The remaining two training sessions lasted approximately 90-minutes, and the content of these sessions emulated high-intensity match conditions. The squad was split into two teams, a first team and a second team, and they played a series of practice games against each other. The games were not \ldblquote full-contact,\rdblquote  but instead required defence to grab or hold attackers rather than completely tackling them.\par

The average Flow score for the Beep Test was 3.74(.46). The average flow score for junior athletes was 3.79(.53), while the average of the remaining four senior athletes was 3.64(.34).\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 16 athletes participated in the first of two training sessions (age = 21.81, SD = 3.25), eight of which were senior athletes (age = 24.38, SD =1.69), and eight of which were junior athletes (age = 19.25, SD = 2.19). The average Flow State of all athletes in the first training session was 4.96(.57), the average flow score for senior athletes was 5.11(.72), whereas the average flow score for junior athletes was 4.83(.42).\par

The average Flow State of all athletes in the first training session was 5.3(0.88), the average flow score for senior athletes was 5.33(.97), whereas the average flow score for junior athletes was 5.25(.84).\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 The flow score for athletes participating in the Beep Test was noticeably lower than the average scores for the two training sessions involving game play.

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 A comparison of junior athletes\rquote  responses to these two questions in the training sessions and after the Beep Test, indicates that the joint action demands of the game play context may be relevant to feelings of anxiety around performance.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 The vignette in which I describe Hongwei\rquote s journey from timid novice to exhilarated junior team member is designed to pose the question of what mechanism(s) could underpin such a process. In addition to Hongwei, I noticed evidence of athletes gradually (and at times suddenly) developing a \ldblquote feel for the game.\rdblquote  My discussions with athletes in interviews confirmed the fact that athletes derived considerable motivation from the experience of suddenly discovering that they are capable of performing one aspect of rugby\rquote s diverse technical skill set. Athletes recount with positivity and energy the moment in which their previously held expectations around individual and team performance were positively violated.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Wang Zhengfeng offered one powerful example. Wang Zhengfeng, now considered a senior athlete, had converted from athletics in 2012, and was an athlete with outstanding physical attributes for rugby\emdash particularly speed and strength. Wang struggled, however, to master some of the basics such as catching and passing and tackling. I asked Wang about his approach to the challenge of learning the skills of rugby from scratch, and he recounted the time he first discovered that he could execute a side step:\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \li512\ri512\fi0 WZF: I imitate. Like when I was learning how to sidestep. At the time I\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?d look at Brother Han (HXL) who had a really good sidestep, I\rquote d just watch him stepping, every day I\rquote d just watch him step, and imitate him. At the start I probably wasn\rquote t practicing it particularly well, I couldn\rquote t quite imitate it, but then after some time, I was playing touch and suddenly produced the exact action! I was so happy! Its not like it appeared at a fixed time or anything, it was like suddenly I just moved a step and it happened. And then like after I stepped once I slowly found the feeling, and then stepping became my own thing. When you pick up new skills for the first time it feels very addictive, I get so happy, when it happens I can stay happy for a long time! \par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 In a similar vein as both Wang and Yang, Han\rquote s animated description of the feeling of \ldblquote two people coordinating (pa-pa-pa)\rdblquote  elicits a positive emotional valence surrounding moments in which expectations around performance are either met or, in the case of an interactional sport of rugby in which expectations are always conditioned by the high uncertainty of the joint action environment, often exceeded.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 The fact that both positive and negative violations of expectations around performance featured prominently in both the social and emotional dimensions of athletes\rquote  experience of rugby at the Institute suggests the possible existence of an important cognitive mechanism linking joint action to processes of social cohesion. When expectations around performance are negatively violated, athletes report strong experiences of social guilt ({\i neijiu}) and rumination on the discrepancy between perceived individual (or team) performance and the expectations around performance that they have internalised from prior experience or authoritative sources such as the coach or more senior athletes. When these expectations are positively violated, by contrast, athletes show evidence of exhilarated emotional response and agency. As I will explain in the following section, it appears that when positive violations of performance expectations are specifically located in components of team performance, the result is a range of phenomena possibly relevant to processes of social cohesion.\par

Through my years training and playing with (and coaching) Chinese rugby teams, I knew that there was a specific lexicon for describing optimal coordination in joint action. The most commonly used term to describe optimal yet effortless coordination is {\i moqi}\u195?\u175?\u194?\u188?\u194?\u710?\u195?\u169?\u194?\u187?\u194?\u732?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u165?\u194?\u8216?), which refers to the phenomenon of \lquote tacit understanding\rquote  between two or more people engaged in a joint activity. {\i Moqi} is a term that applies to all areas of human activity that involves joint action: from sport to music to Chinese comedic \ldblquote cross talk\rdblquote  ({\i xiang sheng} \u195?\u167?\u194?\u8250?\u194?\u184?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u163?\u194?\u176?)\emdash tacit, unspoken understanding between co-actors. In addition to tacit understanding, I would also hear athletes describe the importance of the \ldblquote atmosphere\rdblquote  ({\i qifen} \u195?\u166?\u194?\u176?\u194?\u8221?\u195?\u166?\u194?\u176?\u194?\u8250?) or \ldblquote aura\rdblquote  ({\i qichang} \u195?\u166?\u194?\u176?\u194?\u8221?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u339?\u194?\u186?) between co-actors or within a team.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 The description of these processes, particularly when it derives from personal experience, is particularly animated and emotive, and often appears to contain the experience of positive violation of expectations around performance.

{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 It\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?s really hard for me to say what it feels like. It feels just like a fight for life or death, like you must win the match. Normally, that sort of tacit understanding sometimes isn\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?t there, but then suddenly you coordinate on the field and it you can form this feeling.

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 When I asked athletes in interviews about the experience of tacit understanding in joint action, I received responses that ranged in the level of detail as well as a level of emotionality attached to descriptions. As a general rule, more senior athletes were able to produce more granular and detailed descriptions of what they thought were the components of team click with less emotionality attached to these descriptions. More junior athletes, by contrast, tended to produce less detailed descriptions of coordination of joint action, and instead talked about the phenomenon in more general and emotionally charged terms\emdash often, for example, connecting coordination in joint action with ideas of solidarity or unity ({\i tuanjie} \u195?\u165?\u194?\u8250?\u194?\u162?\u195?\u167?\u194?\u187?\u194?\u8220?) and cohesion ({\i ningjuli} \u195?\u165?\u194?\u8225?\u194?\u32?\u195?\u168?\u194?\u32?\u194?\u353?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u352?\u194?\u8250?) without describing what they thought were the components or causes of the coordination itself. Alternatively, some junior athletes would acknowledge that they of course knew of the idea of tacit understanding and other components of team click, but that their novice status meant that they had not experienced the phenomenon in rugby in particular, and were therefore unable to comment in any detail.\par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 Ming Xiaokai emphasises the role of communication and interaction on and off the field in producing the feeling of tacit understanding. Despite taking the liberty to explore the concept in more detail than Yang Can, Ming Xiaokai also ends up settling on a feeling, in this instance a feeling of solidarity with a teammate. Lu Zhongsheng (a.k.a. \ldblquote Big Mouth Monkey\rdblquote ) was a gregarious senior athlete who was very talkative in our interview.

For example every week(end) a few of us all drink a bit and eat a bit and chat. I think this is very important, because if you have a drink and a meal and talk a bit of shit you feel relatively...you generate that feeling you know? Like when you\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re drinking together and you feel particularly intimate, really close. Besides that then its also when you\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re doing fitness and can\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?t keep up and the coach is going to punish you, and so whoever can\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?t go on you give him a hand and pull him along.

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 More senior athletes tended to stick to a more detailed and granular description of what they considered to be the experience of optimal joint action. Interestingly, however, senior athletes would also easily slip off the topic of joint action. But instead of venturing towards notions of team solidarity and unity, they would instead problematise the lack of these components in the current team, and would point to various rationales for why this was the case.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Athletes\rquote  descriptions of components of team click reveal that questions framed in terms of on field coordination can easily drift into reflections about the broader social processes and dynamics of the team. The extracts included above offer evidence of a relationship between the phenomenon of team click and processes of group formation and perhaps, ultimately, social cohesion. It was clear from my ethnographic observations that despite the utilitarian motivations of individuals, coaches, and officials, the rugby program at the Institute provided offered rich psychological resources. Athletes clearly found friendship, emotional support, guidance, and, importantly, identity by virtue of their membership to the team. Lian Jianxiang, a young trialist of the Coach Zhu era of the team left the team in February 2016, shortly after Zhu left. Nonetheless, even though all of the utilitarian benefits that adherence to the program offered had all but disappeared for Lian, in August 2017 I ran into Lian on the sidelines of the National Games in Tianjin. Lian was in Tianjin to support the Beijing men\rquote s and women\rquote s teams. He wore his Beijing Team apparel and banged loudly on the supporter drum all weekend in support of his former team.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 When I asked athletes to expand on their thoughts around group membership, three core categories emerged. Athletes tended talked about the following components being important to their connection to the team 1) emotional support derived from group membership, 2) a sense of a common goal, and 3) social identity. I will review ethnographic evidence under each of these categories.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 As interview data suggest, some athletes describe the feeling a strong emotional connection to their teammates and to the team. As Meng Cheng explained: \ldblquote you generate that feeling you know? ...you feel particularly intimate, really close.\rdblquote  Lu Zhongsheng recounted a similar phenomenon: \ldblquote It\rquote s the presence of that real feeling that \lquote all for one and one for all\rquote . And then that feeling of everyone crying together is great! Because we\rquote ve endured such agony...\rdblquote  Even the intense critiques of the state of the team launched by the likes of Lu Peng and others are in their own way an indication of emotional attachment to the team; a less invested individual would conceivably not spend the time and energy on such exegesis.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 As junior athlete Yang Can explained when I asked him about his experience of group membership:\par
{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 Because rugby is a team sport, you know. We\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re all brothers, it\rquote s the same as fighting, we\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re born brothers and we\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?ll die as brothers you know, like a family, all together, thinking about how to share the responsibility.

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 Computer games were extremely popular among the athletes, both junior and senior. At the time, from what I could gather by way of conversations, the most popular came among the athletes was a game called League of Legends. League of Legends (LOL) is a is a multiplayer online battle arena video game, in which small teams of individuals team up to fight other teams. Many meals that I attended with the team at the canteen were dominated by discussions of computer games, specifically LOL. I was usually a passive listener in these conversations, but sometimes involved myself in an attempt to learn more.\par

So its no wonder that we love playing them. Different characters have different strengths, 1on1 battles are the basis, but then it also relies on team work and team formations and strategy.\rdblquote  Lu\rquote s comments were consistent with some of the research conducted by Hornbeck on gamers in China, which suggests that explanations for gaming should not be limited to the fact that they promote competitive and violent behavioural tendencies, but that they also provide a space for the activation of moral cognition, one dimension of which includes belonging to a supportive (virtual) community. Han continued the conversation:\par
{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 The thing with gaming is that there are such low entry costs - you might not be that good, but at least anyone can play (he motioned the clicking of a computer mouse with his thumb, index and middle fingers).

Everyone laughed but also expressed respect and wonderment. It served as a conclusion to the conversation that online games are in fact a huge phenomenon. This conversation helped explain the reason why Guo Junping chose to use computer games as an analogue for rugby. The sense of team, and of belonging to a team appear to be a core reason for the comparison.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 In addition to emotional support, and the perception of a common goal, it is clear that athletes also derive resources for social identity formation from group membership. As discussed in the previous chapter, the dominance of hierarchical relationism means that athletes explicitly understand their social identity as interdependent with the social identity of others. In contrast to a conception of social identity theory, in which the individual understands group membership as a function of psychological distance between the category of self and the category of group, hierarchical relationism starts from the default position that all group members are already fused to a highly distributed group identity, and social resources are acquired through a fostering of hierarchical relationships within the group. For the Beijing team, the team is more nuclear family than it is an egalitarian forum for diverse independent interests. This group, regardless of its specific structure, provides athletes with resources to generate a social identity.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Social media was a highly visible forum in which athletes would signal their social identity. Athletes junior and senior would display their connection to rugby on their individual WeChat accounts, by either changing their alias to include some reference to \ldblquote rugby\rdblquote  or their profile picture, to display a photo of a rugby ball or a famous rugby player (see Appendix HYPERLINK). Athletes commented to me that the rugby team at the Institute used to be the most formidable and successful team in the Institute, and that despite the recent fall from grace, the rugby team were still highly revered by the rest of the athletes at the Institute.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Among the 26 athletes I analysed, I observed variation in the intensity of identification with rugby. As the various factions in the team indicated, there was a range of positions that athletes occupied, ranging from the newest arrivals, through to the handful of athletes who had been at the institute for five years, and some of those athletes (Han, Lu, and Su Hailiang) had been training for rugby prior to 2010 at CAU.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 I observed three general categories of social identity drawn from involvement in the team: 1) the newest arrivals and athletes below university level tended to express their interest and like of rugby and enjoyment of the team environment, 2) the unruly undergrads described varying levels of attachment to rugby and the social identity that it afforded, and 3) senior athletes described complete alignment with rugby, such as their identity and future career path aligned with rugby in such a way that, as Han expressed to me, they \ldblquote just want to do this (rugby)\rdblquote  (\u195?\u165?\u194?\u176?\u194?\u177?\u195?\u166?\u194?\u402?\u194?\u179?\u195?\u165?\u194?\u185?\u194?\u178?\u195?\u168?\u194?\u191?\u194?\u8482?\u195?\u164?\u194?\u184?\u194?\u170?).\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 The theme of enjoyment of rugby was a recurrent theme when asking athletes about their motivations for adherence to the sport. Many athletes would cite the obvious incentive of pursuing rugby for the opportunities for tertiary education that it provided. But this rationale would often be yoked with the idea that enjoyment was a similarly motivating factor. As Lu Explained:\par

These rationales do, however, communicate the social resources that the program provides to athletes. All athletes in the program were completely immersed in the life of the team, by definition of their identity as team members.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 The trajectory of athletes in the program, ranging from new arrivals to young hopefuls to undergraduates to senior athletes, displayed a progression of social identity that progressed from enjoyment to more substantial and irreversible processes of social and psychological attachment.

But on another level, the attachment that Ming Xiaokai describes is also a psychological attachment to rugby and the team as the source of belonging and social identity formation.\par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi300 Senior athlete Lu Peng, a viciously proud individual, had also found opportunities for self-validation through his trajectory with rugby. Lu explained to me in interview his personal journey through the ranks of Chinese rugby, from CAU to the Institute:\par
{\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \li512\ri512\fi300 In those years at CAU (and you\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?d know this), when I first arrived, I was not the focus of any nurturing, when I first arrived we were on the sidelines watching. But I think I am different, my attitude is to think I can, I can do it, I will be better than them...I just think, when they look at you and think \ldblquote oh ok you\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?ve just arrived,\rdblquote  and maybe they say \u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u339?based on testing you\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re good, you\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re superior\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u32? but I think I am good for it, I am better than them. But then based on a range of aspects coach splits up the cohort into classes, and its those few athletes will be nutured, and we\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8482?re just average athletes, it was very obvious. TEAM ROLE ANXIETY. And then in my heart I was not satisfied, I thought I was stronger than them, and I wanted to dedicate myself to it. And then I experienced a period of time when I expended a lot of effort, and I came a long way up. Because at the start you are just an average person in their eyes, but then ultimately you get the opportunity through your own efforts. In my class (at Nongda) I should be (considered) the most outstanding. \par
