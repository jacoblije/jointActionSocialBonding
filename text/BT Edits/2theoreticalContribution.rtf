\pard\plain\s2\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs40\sl240\slmult1 \sb240 \fi0 A theory of social bonding through joint action\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb240 \fi0 The human capacity to cooperate within cohesive social groups is a fundamental explanation for our species\rquote  evolutionary success. It is therefore surprising that sport\emdash an ubiquitous organiser of modern social life across cultures\emdash has not been more intensively studied for evidence concerning the cognitive and evolutionary foundations of human sociality {Blanchard1995,Downey2005a}. An integrated scientific study of the social, cognitive, and physiological mechanisms associated with participation in collective group exercise (broadly construed), and the ecological dynamics by which these mechanisms are constrained, stands to offer novel insights into the science of human cognition, cooperation, and evolution.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Whirling Sufi dervishes, late-night electronic music raves, Maasi ceremonial dances, competitive team sports, or the modern cult of Cross-fit\emdash endless examples can be plucked from across cultures and throughout time to exemplify the human compulsion to come together and move together. It is easy to imagine how exertive and coordinated group activity would have served important survival functions in the past, such as hunting, travel, communication, and defence (Sands and Sands, 2010). More puzzling, but also more relevant to the study of human social cohesion, is the persistent recurrence of group exercise in social life, cross-cutting shared cultural practices as varied as religion, sport, music and play, even when its substantive rewards are less obvious or immediate. Social scientists have long speculated about the benefits of energetic group activities for social cohesion (Durkheim, 1965). It is not yet clear, however, how or whether group exercise uniquely generates social cohesion, or in what ways particular mechanisms vary by activity and culture.\par

}\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 A combination of advances in neuroimaging technologies {Frith2007}, emerging neurocomputational theories of brain function {Friston2010,Frith2010,Clark2013}, and constructive attempts to extend the theoretical paradigm of human social cognition to account for inter-individual processes of interaction and coordination {Sebanz2006,Dale2014}, has created an opportunity to empirically examine the relationship between coordinated and exertive group activities and social cohesion. It is now more clearly understood that basal human capacities for physical movement regulation and coordination set the foundation for social cognitive systems whose resources are distributed between brains, bodies, and physical features of task-specific environments {Hutchins2000,Kirsh2006,Semin2008,Semin2012,Coey2012}. Furthermore, it has been shown that the quality of coordinated movement within these cognitive systems has implications for psychophysiological health and subjective wellbeing {Wheatley2012}, and is relevant to the effective function of more complex goal oriented social activities, including the reproduction and transmission of shared cultural practices {Dunbar2012,Roepstorff2010,Claidiere2014,Launay2016}. Thus, the nagging visceral intuition associated with the observable human compulsion to come together and move together could in fact prove useful as a source of insight for progressing the science of human evolution. By interrogating the ways in which component mechanisms and system dynamics of joint action generate social bonding, this dissertation seeks to offer a novel contribution to the cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of social cohesion.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 In this chapter, I begin by drawing upon ethnographic and anecdotal observations from music, ritual, and sport, as well as existing psychological literature of human peak performance, to conceptualise a phenomenology common to interactive and co-active team sports\emdash what I term \ldblquote team click.\rdblquote  I then review existing literature concerning the cognitive and evolutionary anthropology of social cohesion, suggesting the importance of a research programme dedicated to group exercise and social cohesion, in particular, the evolved cognitive mechanisms and systems dynamics associated with coordinated interpersonal movement. I argue that existing literatures concerning behavioural synchrony, mimicry, and dynamic coupling provide the foundation for a theory of social bonding through joint action. This theory informs the specific predictions of this study concerning joint action, team click, and social bonding between professional Chinese rugby players. \par

\pard\plain\s4\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs32\sl240\slmult1 \sb180 \fi0 2.1  Team Click\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Recent research has made a ceremony of invoking one particular passage from Durkheim (1965, pg. 217) to capture the \ldblquote collective effervescence\rdblquote  of exertive and coordinated group activity found in arenas as diverse as music making, dance, military drills, and sport: \ldblquote Once the individuals are gathered together, a sort of electricity is generated from their closeness and quickly launches them to an extraordinary height of exaltation\rdblquote  {McNeill1995,Konvalinka2011,Fischer2014,Mogan2017}. Indeed, this passage powerfully captures the role of collective activity in generating positive emotional states and joint arousal, and lends itself nicely to the hypothesis that this visceral \ldblquote electricity\rdblquote  is attributable in part to neuropharmacologically mediated affective mechanisms associated with pain and reward{Dunbar2008,Cohen2009,Fischer2014,Launay2016}. What is not so effectively evoked in this passage, however, is an aspect of group activity heavily scrutinised in the domain of competitive interactional team sports, as well as other technically demanding joint action scenarios such as music making and dance, and that is the {\i quality} of synchronisation in joint action. For highly skilled practitioners, often the ecstasy of joint action is contingent on the extent to which the actions of one individual click into place with the actions of another\emdash when expectations for joint action are completely aligned. This fine-tuned sensitivity to the dynamics of joint action and the psycho-social effects of this sensitivity suggest that an explanation of group exercise and social bonding must involve more than just a generalised, neurpharmacologically-mediated affective mechanism. Indeed, a full array of mechanisms associated with the social cognition of movement must be considered.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 One of the big mysteries of competitive team sport, particularly at the elite level, is the elusiveness of peak team performance. While each individual athlete may exhibit expert-level competence in sport-specific skills, the much sought-after aggregation of these components, i.e. a team that consistently performs \ldblquote in the zone,\rdblquote  and \ldblquote firing on all cylinders,\rdblquote  in reality often proves frustratingly difficult to achieve and sustain. As King and De Rond [568]{King2011} note in their ethnography of the 2008 Cambridge University rowing crew who participated (and who were eventually victorious) in the famous annual Boat Race against Oxford University, while the search for collective rhythm is a universal in human social interaction, the physiological and psychological complexity of finding that rhythm \ldblquote ...is extremely difficult to attain; collective performance is a possibility not a certainty.\rdblquote  The moment in which everything \ldblquote clicks\rdblquote  into place in team sport can, for various reasons, disappear as abruptly as it arrives, if indeed it arrives at all. But when \ldblquote team click\rdblquote  is cultivated, and sustained, it is celebrated as the ultimate, albeit often inexplicable magic of sporting feats. Consider Leicester City Football Club\rquote s unbelievable outhouse-to-penthouse title run in the 2015 English Premier League, the recent dominance of the Golden State Warriors in the American National Basketball League, or the astonishingly consistent performance of the New Zealand men\rquote s national rugby union team the \ldblquote All Blacks\rdblquote , who are arguably the most successful sporting team ever (with a winning percentage of 77% in the last 150 years; 88% in the last 6 years). All of these teams carry with them a powerful \ldblquote aura\rdblquote  associated with their capacity to effectively coordinate their behaviours on the field over extended time scales: individual games, seasons, and, in the case of the All Blacks, entire generations. It is tempting to be seduced by the aura of such rare instances of collective performance. It is much more important to instead attempt to move from mystery to mechanism, and explain these collective phenomena in terms of their admittedly slight more banal social, historical, physiological, and psychological components and dynamics.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 For athletes, coaches, and spectators alike,\ldblquote team click\rdblquote  can be a hugely powerful sensation. As theologian Michael Novak explains, \ldblquote [f]or those who have participated on a team that has known the click of communality, the experience is unforgettable, like that of having attained, for a while at least, a higher level of existence\rdblquote  [11]{White2011}. As has been extensively documented in the psychological literature of \ldblquote flow\rdblquote  {Csikszentmihalyi1992} and optimal human performance in sport {Jackson1999}, athletes engaged in team coordination often report total absorption in and complete focus on the task at hand, a transformation of the experience of time (either speeding up or slowing down), and a blurring or transcendence of individual agency, or a \ldblquote loss of self\rdblquote  {Csikszentmihalyi1992,Jackson1995,Jackson1999,McNeill1995}. Research suggests that flow often occurs in scenarios in which there are clear goals inherent in the activity, as well as unambiguous feedback concerning extent to which goals are either being achieved or not. In addition, scenarios most conducive to the experience of flow are those in which the technical requirements are challenging but achievable if practitioners are able to extend slightly beyond their normal capabilities{Fong2015}. The coalescence of these factors is intrinsically rewarding and autotelic{Csikszentmihalyi1975}, activating both \ldblquote hedonic\rdblquote  and \ldblquote eudaimonic\rdblquote  dimensions of subjective well-being {Huta2010,Fave2009}. The vast majority of flow research has focussed on the experience of the individual athlete, musician, or performer. However, recent attempts have been made to extended an analysis of flow and its antecedents to the level of the group and dynamics of interpersonal coordination\emdash a phenomenon termed \ldblquote group flow\rdblquote  {Sawyer2006}. Indeed, as the phenomenon of team click suggests, individual experiences of flow are almost always embedded in and contingent upon cognitive processes and contextual dynamics involving co-actors and the physical environment, even if the existing literature preferences an individual-centred account of the phenomenon{Kirsh2006,Marsh2009,Noy2015}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Importantly, team click appears to have important flow-on consequences relevant to social bonding and affiliation. Tightly synchronised activity in particular, found in team sports such as rowing, can help dissolve the boundaries between individual and social agency: \ldblquote In rowing...it feels like you have at your command the power of everybody else in the boat. You are exponentially magnified. What was a strain before becomes easier. It is absolutely the ultimate team sport\rdblquote  {Brown2016}. The blurring of agency between self and team may be responsible for facilitating affiliation and trust between teammates in competitive environments often involving high stress and uncertainty: \ldblquote ...you always wanted a guy who would go into the trenches with you and he always played consistently well...he could really play and was just one of the good lads that you enjoyed his company\rdblquote  {Fox-Sports2017}. In this sense, the experience of team click may act as a social diagnostic tool, a powerful signal of commitment to joint action and willingness to cooperate {Reddish2013a}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 The experience of flow has by now been extensively studied by psychologists and neuroscientists, from which a series of neuropharmacological {Boecker2008}, neurocognitive {Dietrich2006,Dietrich2011,Labelle2013}, and psychological {Csikszentmihalyi1992} theories for its emergence have been tabled. However, throughout this process, the social dimensions of optimal human experience have been less scrutinised, despite strong anecdotal and observational evidence of phenomena such as \ldblquote team click,\rdblquote  \ldblquote group flow,\rdblquote  and social bonding emanating from these collective states. In the sections that follow, I draw upon related strands from cognitive, neuroscientific, and psychological\emdash including social psychological\emdash literatures in order to develop a novel theoretical account of the relationship between synchronised interpersonal joint action and social bonding, and the mediating role of \ldblquote team click.\rdblquote \par
\pard\plain\s4\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs32\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 2.2  Cultural Evolution\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 The systemic under-theorisation of the social dimensions of human cognition is partly due to the nature of core assumptions and idealisations necessarily employed in testing theories of complex cognitive and evolutionary processes. The central theoretical challenge for cognitive and evolutionary explanations of human behaviour involves accounting for the mechanisms through which cultural practices transmit and fixate in populations. The modern evolutionary synthesis and cognitive revolution created the scientific conditions in which a testable, Darwinian theory of cultural transmission became possible. First articulated by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman {Cavalli-Sforza1981} and then by Boyd and Richerson {Boyd1988}, the working approach to human cultural evolution begins with the assumption that cultural information, i.e., information capable of affecting individuals\rquote  behaviour that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation, and other forms of social transmission, evolves via mechanisms similar to those that act on genetic information. Borrowing from evolutionary biology, theorists adopt game-theoretical population genetics models to help demonstrate the selective pressures placed upon cultural information. The strictest versions of this approach propose the \ldblquote meme\rdblquote  as a gene-like unit of cultural information, which, like a gene, is subject to selection pressures of replication. Memes that successfully replicate successfully populate{Dawkins1976}. Other theories of cultural evolution adjust population genetic models to take into account the observable differences between cultural and genetic information, such as culture\rquote s capacity to support one-to-many transmission, the blending of cultural variants, and non-randomly guided variation. These adjustments are part of the concession that that cultural variants are not as dependent on high fidelity replication as their genetic cousins, but instead are shaped by evolved cognitive biases that favour the acquisition and transmission of some cultural variants over others due to their memorability or effectiveness {Henrich2007}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 These start-up assumptions of models of cultural evolution directed attention towards the causal role of micro-evolutionary cognitive mechanisms of imitation, teaching, and memory, in enabling high fidelity copying (with occasional mutation-like errors) of cultural variants between individuals and throughout populations with distributions stable enough for selection to operate. Models indicate that for social learning to actually enhance population fitness, it must be cumulative throughout generations, i.e., individuals must be able to socially learn what they could not learn on their own {Boyd1995}. Thus, particular attention has been paid to the mechanisms that could be responsible for facilitating species-unique {\i cumulative} culture {Tomasello2008}. Evidence from comparative and developmental psychology indeed suggests a precocious and species-unique tendency to accurately imitate the actions of trusted or authoritative others (even when the goal of the action is unclear) sets the cognitive foundation for the transmission of cultural representations {Tomasello2014a}. The microevolutionary processes have also been enhanced by supplementing macroevolutiony processes, also known as cultural phylogenetics {Mace1994}. The phylogenetic comparative method seeks to understand long-term cultural change at or above the level of the society by 1) reconstructing the cultural evolutionary history of a particular trait or set of traits and 2) testing functional hypotheses concerning the spread or distribution of cultural variation across societies while controlling for evolutionary history. The combination of these micro- and macroevolutionary approaches supports the theory that \ldblquote dual-inheritance\rdblquote  or \ldblquote co-evolution\rdblquote  of genetic and cultural information in humans over time has led to the development of prosocial norms and institutions that facilitate collective adherence to shared cultural practices {Richerson2008,Chudek2011}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Cognitive and evolutionary approaches to culture and social cohesion have made productive empirical strides in identifying the proximate cognitive mechanisms most relevant to ultimate evolutionary explanations for the distribution of shared cultural practices around which human groups cohere, particularly in relation to large scale cultural forms such as religion {Henrich2015,Purzycki2016b}. In contrast to the informal, idiosyncratic, and subjective schemas of historical linguistics, archaeology, and social and cultural anthropology, these micro and macro theories of human cultural evolution are explicit in their assumptions, repeatable and extendable by others, and easily scaled up to large datasets {Mesoudi2017}. The fact that many details of human social interaction still remain open scientific questions is a necessary part of the trade-off involved in building a scientific formulation of cultural evolution and social cohesion. However, the interactive and affective mechanisms of shared cultural practices (i.e., the unmistakably \ldblquote visceral\rdblquote  dimension referenced above) appear, phenomenologically at least, to be of distinct relevance to processes of cultural information transfer, and thus require careful and considered incorporation into a theory of cultural transmission.\par

}\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 2.2.1  Cultural Attraction\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 There is evidence to suggest that, beyond microevolutionary mechanisms of transmission, other factors may also have an important causal impact on the accumulation and distribution of cultural variants. For example, demographic factors such as population size, structure, and interconnectedness have been shown to determine cultural complexity (variation) in hunter gatherer populations, with adaptive implications {Henrich2004}. It has also been suggested that variation in prosociality, social bonding, and social cohesion could have an important bearing on information transfer between individuals and within groups {Heyes2011,Whitehouse2014,Wheatley2016}. As researchers in comparative and social psychology have pointed out, humans do not merely aggregate, but rather actively congregate around shared cultural practices, seemingly driven by species-unique affective and motivational mechanisms{Dunbar2010,Tomasello2005a}. In addition, there is evidence of cross-cultural variation in the microevolutionary dynamics of cultural evolution, for example, with specifically higher social learning in collectivistic East Asian societies than in individualistic Western societies {Mesoudi2015,DiYanni2015}. These empirical details have formed the basis of models of multilevel selection, which propose selection pressures at the gene, individual, and group for society-level cultural variants such as religious ritual, warfare, and agricultural practices {Turchin2013,Atkinson2011a}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 In light of this collection of evidence, researchers have sought to broaden the scope of cultural evolution by relaxing the strictly selectional logic of memetic and dual-inheritance models, instead suggesting that cultural variants will tend locally towards certain \ldblquote attractor points\rdblquote  depending on the diverse cognitive, demographic, ecological factors of attraction to which they are subjected {Sperber1996}. Rather than explaining patterns of cultural diversity, stability, and change in terms of the differential selection of certain cultural variants (e.g., content biases) or differential copying of certain individuals (e.g., success bias, prestige bias), \ldblquote cultural attraction theory\rdblquote (CAT) focuses on how cultural variants are systematically {\i re-produced} by a combination of frequency dependent (i.e. conformity) and context sensitive (i.e. prestige) transmission biases, and the biophysical, psychological, historical, and ecological dynamics by which these biases are constrained and directed {Claidiere2014}. It has been pointed out that in contrast to genetic evolution, the mechanisms responsible for transmitting cultural information in humans (imitation, learning, and memory) cannot alone explain population level stabilisation of cultural variants, because they are not faithful enough to stabilise distributions of cultural variants on which selection can operate

CAT suggests instead that population level cultural variation is produced by processes that are partly preservative (i.e., occur via mechanisms of transmission), and partly re-constructive\emdash the combination of which will result in cultural variants that tendentially converge upon particular types, called attractor points.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Broadening the theoretical scope of cultural evolution in this way enables a more detailed consideration of the microevolutionary processes of cultural information transfer beyond the traditional candidates for preservative transmission. In particular, the role of proximate cognitive, neurological, and social mechanisms of interpersonal interaction in facilitating social cohesion around shared cultural practices can be afforded much closer attention. Thus, the highly visceral quality of shared cultural practices that contain elements of rigorous and coordinated group exercise could be a signal of important and hitherto unarticulated information concerning the proximate componential mechanisms, dynamical constraints, and ultimate evolutionary explanations for human uniqueness [3]{Claidiere2014}. What, then, is the role of group exercise in human sociality? Specifically, how does the joint movement associated with group exercise contexts uniquely generate social cohesion, and how do particular mechanisms vary by activity and culture?\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Working within this specific research domain, in the following section I attempt to account for a for a theoretical link between proximate mechanisms of highly interactive and exertive collective movement common in competitive team sports such as rugby union, and the feeling of \ldblquote team click\rdblquote  that appears to arise in athletes when the synchronisation of collective movement meets (or exceeds) athletes\rquote  prior expectations. In turn, I seek to account for the process mechanisms that could explain how high quality joint action responsible for team click could by extension generate social bonding effects. I review existing literature concerning the relationship between joint action and social bonding. In particular I review research concerning behavioural synchrony, a special case of joint action. The bonding effects of behavioural synchrony have been studied directly for over 10 years, and empirical evidence has confirmed and developed hypothesised relationships between coordinated physical movement and prosocial behaviour, perceived social bonding, positive affect, and modulation of feelings of exertion and fatigue. I point out opportunities for theoretical and empirical progress using prevailing theories of action, joint action, and social cognition. I suggest that these strands of research provide the basis for testable predictions concerning the relationship between proximate mechanisms of joint action and social cohesion, with \ldblquote team click\rdblquote  as an important mediating phenomenology of this relationship. To conclude the chapter, I formulate the specific predictions of this thesis. }\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Physical movement is central to the adaptive success of biological life, particularly life for which movement can intentionally directed in order to bring about change in the environment. Within cognitive science and psychology, the term {\i action} is used to distinguish intentional, agent-directed movement from other forms of movement {Davidson1980}. Humans display a rich capacity for complex forms of autonomic and preconceived physical movement, which is employed in the coordination of behaviours with the environment and socially with conspecifics. Indeed, the ultra-social nature of the human species dictates that all human movement has a latent action potential - everything from ostensive communicative signals to implicit cues derived from inadvertent movement can carry a social charge {Danchin2004}, and it appears that humans have evolved reward mechanisms for adaptive coordination of movement with conspecifics and the physical environment {Wheatley2012,Parkinson2015,Wheatley2016}. Specifically, the term \ldblquote joint action\rdblquote  is used to describe any form of social interaction whereby two or more individuals coordinate their actions in space and time to bring about a change in the environment {Sebanz2006a}. Considering this dissertation\rquote s specific theoretical focus on the relationship between proximate mechanisms of group exercise and their effects of team click and social bonding, the social cognition of joint action provides the most appropriate entry point for analysis. Joint action, broadly construed according to the definition above, encompasses various areas of empirical research, including behavioural synchrony {Reddish2013,Launay2016,Mogan2017} and nonconscious mimicry {Bargh2012}\emdash the bonding effects of which have been clearly demonstrated. Joint action of course also encompasses less tightly coupled forms of interpersonal coordination, the social dynamics of which are only just beginning to be analysed theoretically, experimentally, and observationally {Marsh2009}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Extensive research within developmental, comparative, and social psychology demonstrates that various cognitive, sensorimotor, affective, and cultural processes underpin the ability to establish and maintain joint action. As such, the mechanisms responsible for feelings of team click and social bonding through joint action may also be various and diverse. On a fundamental level, joint action depends on the abilities to 1) develop functionally similar representations of a shared task between two or more individuals, and 2) anticipate and integrate the effects of own and others\rquote  actions in the representation of a joint action{Sebanz2006a}. The cognitive mechanisms that underpin these abilities can be organised into three main categories: 1) mechanisms that enable shared task representations, 2) mechanisms that facilitate the formation and maintenance of functional interpersonal synergies between co-actors (see above), and 3) mechanisms that serve to contextually frame joint action, such as internalisation of explicit cultural conventions{Sebanz2006,Vesper2017}. Ethnographic and experimental evidence suggests that the social effects of joint action are most pronounced when these specific component mechanisms are maximally activated {Durkheim1965,McNeill1995,Mogan2017}. The fact that the link between behavioural synchrony and social bonding is most closely analysed may indeed be associated with the fact that this form of joint action is the most accentuated and idealised. The time- and phase-locked coordination of behaviour characteristic of behavioural synchrony (hereafter synchrony) is recurrent in many cultural practices including music making, dance, sport, and military drills, and its behavioural effects include prosociality, perceptions of social bonding, and positive affect {Mogan2017}. Synchrony is a predictable and cheap coordinator of behaviour, and is easily scalable to the coordination of behaviour in large groups, which may explain its cross-cultural ubiquity in cultural practices {Dunbar2010,Tarr2016}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 However, similar social effects and process mechanisms appear to take place in other joint action scenarios in which movement is not as tightly or predictably coupled. Experimental research on non-conscious mimicry indicates that positive social effects such as liking, rapport, and cooperation are observable when participants ether mimic others or unwittingly are mimicked by a confederate, but not when participants are made consciously aware that the mimicry was taking place {Bos2008,Lakin2008}. In addition, dynamic coupling has been shown to exist in more complex dyadic and group joint action scenarios, such as those found in martial arts {Schmidt2011}, music performance ensembles {Demos2014}, sub-phases of interactive team sports {Duarte2013}, and group dancing {Chauvigne2017}. These studies find evidence of complex multi-scale \ldblquote fractal-like\rdblquote  coordination between co-participants, often existing at the pre-perceptual level of awareness {Schmidt2011,Riley2011,Fusaroli2013}. While behavioural synchrony has understandably received the most attention from experimental social psychology, presumably due to the ease in which it can be experimentally manipulated, less tightly controlled forms of joint action have been much less closely scrutinised for evidence of their social and affective dimensions[but see]{Marsh2009,Miles2009}. This is a clear theoretical and empirical gap in the social cognition of joint action; one that this dissertations seeks to address.\par
\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 3.0.2  Neurocognitive and physiological mechanisms linking synchrony and social bonding\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 In order to address this gap in the literature concerning the social dimensions of real-world joint action, it is necessary to begin by assessing the existing literature, which predominantly focusses on the social effects of tightly coupled behavioural synchrony. Three mechanisms have been identified as underpinning the various social effects of synchrony {Lang2017,Mogan2017}. First, synchrony has been associated with the phenomenon of \ldblquote self-other merging,\rdblquote  whereby synchronous activity blurs the perceptual or phenomenological boundaries between self and other/group agency, possibly due partly to exact action-perception matching of synchronised activity {Hove2008}. Second, it has been proposed that synchrony enhances group-centred cognition, whereby attention to the actions of others enables the calibration of behaviours and enables the rehearsal of cooperation. Group centred cognition is thus often operationalised as perceived cooperation between co-participants {Reddish2013}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Third, synchrony appears to be responsible for activating an affective physiological mechanism, which has been associated on the one hand with feelings of calm, euphoria, and positive affect, and on the other hand with prosocial behaviours such as decision making in economic games and spontaneous helping {Wiltermuth2009,Reddish2013a,Mogan2017}. It has been proposed that this synchrony-activated affective mechanism is neuropharmacologically mediated, the primary candidate being the endogenous opioid system. Unfortunately for the purposes of measurement, endorphins do not cross the blood-brain barrier in humans, and thus require invasive and expensive methods. As such, the \ldblquote endorphin hypothesis\rdblquote  in synchronous and exertive human group activity is operationalised in experimental settings by measuring pain threshold {Dunbar2008,Sullivan2013,Sullivan2014,Tarr2015}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Importantly, it appears that for these three mediating mechanisms of synchrony, \ldblquote group-size matters.\rdblquote  In the case of self-other merging and group-centred cognition mechanisms\emdash predominantly neurocognitive in character\emdash results appear to be strongest in synchrony experiments involving dyads and small groups, for which the attentional requirements for tracking co-participants is within healthy adult human capacity {Mogan2017}.The affective pathway between synchrony and social bonding, by contrast, appears to function more effectively in large group settings, in which the cognitive load associated with tracking and attending to specific co-actors in joint action is more burdensome, and where prosocial behaviour and social bonding is generalised beyond specific individuals {Reddish2013b, Reddish2016}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 A recently published experiment designed to systematically assess the relationship between these three hypothesised mediators and the social effects of synchrony found that synchronisation between individuals (a series of waving arm movements) positively activated all three mediating mechanisms (self-other merging, group-centred cognition, and higher pain threshold), and led to higher levels of liking and prosocial behaviour (measured by contributions to the confederate in a \ldblquote trust\rdblquote  economic game) {Lang2017}. Interestingly, the likeability and economic game measurements were uncorrelated, and path analysis revealed that self-other merging and group-centred cognition displayed high predictive power in mediating the effects of synchrony on likeability but not on behaviour in the economic game. The affective mechanism (measured by pain threshold), by contrast, exhibited a significant positive relationship between pain threshold increase and both likeability and economic game investment. Combining all three pathways in one model resulted in two significant paths: one involving pain-threshold increase to higher investments; and another through group-centred cognition to likeability of the interaction partner. These results thus support a distinction between the neurocognitive and physiological aspects of synchrony, and suggest that neurocognitive mechanisms of synchrony enable \ldblquote cognising in the we mode\rdblquote  {Gallotti2013,Hasson2016,Kirschner2010}, whereas physiological processes might play a crucial role in economic decision-making, perhaps by helping reduce the inherent stress involved in social interaction {Mogan2017,Kret2015,Stanley2011}. This research indicates that various distinct but complementary mechanisms may work in concert to generate the social effects of synchrony, and this should also be expected to be the case in the less tightly coupled instances of joint action such as those found in competitive interactive team sports.\par
\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 3.0.3  Applicability of synchrony-induced mechanisms of social bonding to joint-action, and their relevance to team click\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 For the purposes of this dissertation it is important to consider to what extent these mechanisms are applicable to the study of joint action beyond the tightly matched behaviour of synchrony. In particular, attention will be paid to mechanisms that appear most relevant to the observable phenomenon of team click. While neuropharmacologically mediated affective mechanisms of synchrony are no doubt relevant to joint action and social bonding in group exercise contexts [see]{Cohen2009,Sullivan2013,Tarr2015}, the phenomenology of \ldblquote team click\rdblquote  suggests that the perceived quality of joint action with co-actors is also crucial to the experience, and thus neurocognitive mechanisms of joint action especially are implicated. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that traditional distinction between physiological (affective) mechanisms and neurcognitive mechanisms of joint action should be reevaluated based on emerging neurocomputational theories of brain function and theories of distributed social cognition {Pessoa2013,Pessoa2014,Miller2017}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Mechanisms of joint action} It is understood that establishing and maintaining commitment to joint action, broadly construed, depends on an ability to somehow share a functionally equivalent representation of the joint task{Vesper2010,Michael2016}. Evidence for ability to form and commit to shared tasks can be identified in infant development. Newborns and infants engage in dyadic relationships in which imitation and other proto-conversational communicative behaviours emerge in a symmetrical and contingent fashion with with carers (also known as \ldblquote motherese,\rdblquote  see 
[{\field{\*\fldinst{\lang1024 REF BIB_Braten2007 \\* MERGEFORMAT }}{\fldrslt{Braten2007}}}
]). A the age of approximately 9 months, more complex multi-agent \ldblquote triadic\rdblquote  interactions can be sustained {Colle2008}, seemingly underpinned by a enhanced capacity to maintain joint attention. In experimental settings, infants demonstrate a precocious tendency (compared to captive non-human primate adults) to imitate the actions of authoritative others {Tomasello2014}, and are known to be highly susceptible to automatic processes of motor and emotional contagion and entrainment {Bargh2012}. The mechanisms that underpin these examples of early life joint action confer obvious adaptive benefits, and, as demonstrated in the nonconscious mimicry and behavioural synchrony literatures, appear to be directly tied to neurobiological reward mechanisms and prosocial behaviours {Hurley2008,Launay2016}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Joint action requires mechanisms that not only generate shared task representations, but also those that facilitate the on-line monitoring and updating of representations such that they are adaptively calibrated to the representations of co-actors, and to the task-specific environment. Whether it is a physical piece of furniture that is being moved, or an abstract mental concept that is the object of discursive \ldblquote movement\rdblquote  in a spoken conversation or written exchange, joint action demands the ability to coordinate attention and communicate sensorimotor information relevant to a common focal point. The basal human capacity to maintain joint attention to a common object (which starts to emerge by 9-12 months in infants, 
[{\field{\*\fldinst{\lang1024 REF BIB_Carpenter2013 \\* MERGEFORMAT }}{\fldrslt{Carpenter2013}}}, see
]) underwrites higher order and elaborate process of sharing attention around mental representations and articulating explicit common goals {Tomasello2014}. Humans are particularly adept, even from a very young age, at attending to biological motion {Scholl2000}, especially when it carries socially-relevant information {Kozlowski1977,Cutting1977,Dittrich1996}. We are capable of reading others\rquote  affective states from body movements, body posture, gestures, facial expressions, and action performance, possibly via activation of the observer\rquote s corresponding states {Bastiaansen2009,Borgomaneri2012}. Sharing emotions with others provides motivational cues helpful to initiate and continue joint tasks and to facilitate coordination {Michael2016}. Existing evidence suggests that the communicative function of emotions may operate via a two system model which distinguishes between automatic reflexes-based manifestations of an emotional message and more deliberate emotional expression based on reflection and decision-making{DeGelder2006}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Self-other merging} The well-documented experience of synchrony-induced self-other overlap, associated with a distribution of agency to co-participants and a \ldblquote sense of oneness with the group\rdblquote  {Swann2012} does appear to be relevant to the experience of \ldblquote team click\rdblquote  and joint action more broadly. The flow literature consistently documents reports from athletes, musical performers, and other expert practitioners involving a \ldblquote loss of self\rdblquote  and an extension of agency in joint action to co-participants {Jackson1995,Jackson1999}. However, it is not yet clear via what mechanisms self-other merging is generated in these activities, and which of these mechanisms in particular is most applicable to \ldblquote team click.\rdblquote \par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Controlled experiments have demonstrated that simultaneous activation of one\rquote s own muscles and the observation of others behaving in an identical way leads to a blurring of the self and other in the mind of the individual {Hurley2008,Rizzolatti2004}. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that coordination observed between agents in joint action relies on the mirror neuron system, which enables the execution of similar but independent motor programs co-activated by a direct link between action and perception {Rizzolatti2004}. While this interpretation of self-other merging is parsimonious with exact matching of action and perception common in behavioural synchrony, it is less applicable to an explanation of the extension and blurring of agency that occurs in joint action that does not involve direct action-perception matching. Indeed, results of self-other overlap-mediated bonding effects of synchrony are in fact mixed, with some studies failing to find a direct relationship {Cohen2013a,Reddish2013a}, and replications of seminal studies have failed to reproduce effects of cooperation or perceived social bonding {Dam2012,Schachner2010}.{\cs62\super\chftn}
{\*\footnote\pard \s65\ql\fi-113\li397\lin397\f0\fs20{\cs62\super\chftn} Schachner and Garvin (2010), for example, conducted a direct replication of Wiltermuth and Heath\rquote s (2009) third study and found that synchrony did not increase cooperation, nor perceived social bonding (i.e., trust, similarity and feelings of being in the same team.}
 It is plausible that other cognitive mechanisms mechanisms may be at play in both exact synchrony and joint action more broadly.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Accumulating experimental evidence in joint action suggests that, in addition to direct action perception mechanisms, interoceptive (internal) representations of action-oriented motor programs also play a mediating role in successful coordination in joint action {Moreau2016}. Interoceptive representation of joint action has been shown to occur when a partner is absent but believed to be acting in another room {Milward2014}, or when a partner is co-present but whose actions are occluded {Atmaca2011}, suggesting that individuals do not simply rely on a direct action-perception coupling, but also internally generate motor programs including the roles of co-actors in these shared motor tasks. Evidence suggests that the neural signature of action planning is modulated when one\rquote s own action is part of a joint plan, compared to performing a corresponding solo or bimanual action, which indicates that neural representation of joint action is distinct from that of individual action, and may be indicative of a broader (extra-neural) cognitive system with dimensions and resources that are unique to joint action {Kourtis2014}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Grounded representations} It is thought that representations of cognitive systems generated in joint action scenarios are grounded in and constrained by 1) an actors\rquote  intra-individual sensorimotor representations and 2) the specific extra-personal context of the joint action {Sebanz2006}. This has been demonstrated experimentally by contriving joint action situations involving little or no online perceptual information about the co-actor, for example coordinating the landing of a horizontal jump with an occluded co-actor {Vesper2012}. When compared to an equivalent intra-individual coordination task (a bi-pedal coordination of a horizontal jump), similarities between intra- and inter-individual coordination dynamics suggest common mechanisms underlying both {Schmidt2008}. Thus, it follows that shared task representations in joint action also rely on scaffolds sourced locally, from an individual\rquote s own sensorimotor processes and immediate environmental affordances{Williams2009}. Frith and Frith {Frith2010} suggest that humans have evolved a particularly strong propensity to assign agency from perception of biological motion (known in evolutionary psychology as the Hyperactive Agency Detection Device or HADD, see 
[{\field{\*\fldinst{\lang1024 REF BIB_Barrett2000 \\* MERGEFORMAT }}{\fldrslt{Barrett2000}}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{\lang1024 REF BIB_Barrett2007 \\* MERGEFORMAT }}{\fldrslt{Barrett2007}}}
]), which could explain a tendency seen in religious practices to misattribute agency to supernatural agents {Atran2010}. Likewise, the misattribution of agency to teammates due to their contribution to shared task representations could also be a plausible explanation for \ldblquote feelings of oneness with the group\rdblquote  experienced by athletes when they \ldblquote feel the click\rdblquote  {Swann2009}. The equivalence between feelings of self and distributed agency owing to common neurophysiological architecture underpinning both representations, may provide the psychological basis for social bonding in joint action. Considering this evidence, it appears that self-other merging, common to the experience of behavioural synchrony and coordinated joint action more generally, relies on a range of cognitive mechanisms beyond exact behavioural matching.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Self-other distinction} Exact imitation of the actions of others is, of course, not always an adaptive approach to joint action. Complex joint actions also rely for their successful execution on a higher order ability to {\i differentiate} between the actions of self and other and the translation of co-actors\rquote  roles in joint action into self- and task-relevant information {Novembre2012,Sowden2014,Milward2016}. The ability to cognitively process the fact that another actor may hold an attitude or intention that is contradictory to one\rquote s own emerges as an implicit (pre-declarative) capacity in infants from as early as 7 to 9 months {Baron-Cohen1991}, before an explicit (declarative) capacity (known as \ldblquote formal ToM\rdblquote ) emerges between the age of 3-5 years. Concomitant with acquisition of more complex grammatical structures of spoken language, formal ToM allows humans to dynamically execute role-reversible and goal-directed action plans {Tomasello2005a,Tomasello2008,Tomasello2014}. Self-other differentiation in joint action appears to generate positive psycho-social effects. de Guzman and colleagues {DeGuzman2015}, for example, showed that participants trained to increase self\u195?\u162?\u194?\u8364?\u194?\u8220?other control in the motor domain demonstrate increased empathic corticospinal responses and self-reported empathy, as well as an increased ability to control imitation of others.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Contextual framings for joint action} Joint actions that involve complex sequences and divisions of labour between participants appear to rely heavily on capacities to explicitly signal intention for the assigning of roles, forward planning, and repair of failed coordination {Frith2010}. These \ldblquote coordination smoothers\rdblquote  {Vesper2017} often function to reduce spatial and temporal variation in action by providing a shared spatiotemporal referent for co-alignment of predictions. Cultural conventions are examples of effective framing devices for joint action. Depending on the context of the joint action, it could be subject to a pre-existing, mutually recognised power relation typical in the established culture (e.g., favouring hierarchical or egalitarian communication, [see]{Cheon2011}) and the particular situational context (e.g., formal or informal). Establishing roles, such as leader or follower, also has a similar smoothing effect, and often the affordances in the task environment shape the smoothing strategies available to co-actors {Marsh2009}.\par
\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 3.0.4  Group-centred cooperation\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 The evidence outlined above suggests that humans have evolved a suite of cognitive mechanisms that facilitate robust variation in strategies of merging with, and differentiation from, others for the purposes of adaptive joint action. In what ways do these mechanisms reward successful joint action, and how do these processes vary by activity and culture?\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Given the diversity of mechanisms that appear to contribute to the social effects of joint action, the neurocognitive mechanism of group centred cognition\emdash identified in the synchrony literature\emdash could provide useful framework for understanding the processes through which joint action generates social bonding. Recent evidence suggests that the most powerful social effects of joint action are achieved when an explicitly shared goal is complemented and enhanced by perceptions of synchrony between co-actors {Frith2010,Reddish2013}. In this sense, synchrony is not simply the matching of behaviours but an outcome of, and an input to, joint action with consequences for cooperation and social bonding {Keller2014,Lumsden2012,Obhi2011}. Reddish and colleagues {Reddish2013} utilise path analysis to empirically substantiate the role of explicit and implicit cognitive processes in joint action. The \ldblquote reinforcement of cooperation model,\rdblquote  proposes that the social bonding effects of synchrony can be explained by the way in which synchronised behaviour implicitly enhances perceptions of successful cooperation, which in turn improves confidence and trust between co-actors, and then transfers to future cooperative tasks. Further evidence suggests that the {\i perceived} success of a synchrony task is a critical predictor of cooperative behaviour in economic games, more so than the precise matching of movements{Kurzban2001,Launay2013}. In other words, more important than the actual quality of coordination in joint action might be the extent to which synchronisation in a specific joint action task aligns with co-actors\rquote  {\i expectations} for that task. The reinforcement of cooperation model accords well with the dimension of team click, described above, pertaining to forging trust and perceptions of reliability between co-actors in joint action. The highly visceral experience of movement coordination in joint action could function as a powerful signal of commitment and cooperation\emdash a communication that one is trustworthy and competent enough to join another and fight \ldblquote in the trenches,\rdblquote  for example.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Prediction and expectation in joint action} The alignment of co-actors\rquote  representations of joint action, via direct action-perception matching, or through the generation of functionally equivalent interoceptive shared-task representations, requires as a foundation the ability to anticipate or predict the actions of others. In addition to prediction, sensitivity and attention to sensorimotor information available online in the task environment is crucial for the process of monitoring and updating shared task representations. Shared task representations appear to undergo a process of refinement, through an iterative process in which predictions about the consequences of partner-generated actions are tested against actual sensory inputs, with residual prediction errors in this fitting process being integrated into an updated shared task representation {Vesper2016}. While joint action and synchrony literatures occasionally allude to the role of prediction in coordinating joint action on this level of technality [see for example][]{Sebanz2009,Glover2017}, prevailing theories of brain function and social cognition are yet to be fully incorporated into an account of joint action. In particular, the neurocognitive processes and system dynamics of information transfer in social interaction suggests a model of joint-action in which predictive interoceptive models of joint action interact and synergise depending on their functional equivalence in cognitively distributed task-specific environments. In this sense, the \ldblquote click\rdblquote  of joint action could be associated with the extent to which prediction is optimised in a cognitive system involving joint action coordination. In the following section I suggest that a theory of social bonding through joint action in group exercise contexts such as rugby union must incorporate these prevailing theories in order to fully account for the phenomenon of team click.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 In this section, I suggest that in order to account for the relationships between joint action, team click, and social bonding, a theory of social cognition grounded in the system dynamics of basal human capacities for physical movement is required. Biological and cultural evolutionary processes have facilitated remarkable transformations in human brain function from its humble mammalian beginnings. But, it is also important to keep in mind that the first ever problem solved by the mammalian brain was regulating physical movement, because physical movement remains its basal logic, even in humans who now at least {\i appear} to be more preoccupied in day-to-day life with higher-order cognitive abstractions. The basic design of the human brain was largely evident in simpler animals that had to solve the basic problems of survival in situated environments{Pezzulo2014}. }\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 As outlined above, steady improvements in neuroimaging technologies {Frith2007} and neurocomputational theories of brain function {Friston2010,Frith2010}, and attempts to extend the theoretical paradigm of cognition to encompass and satisfactorily account for inter-individual processes of interaction and coordination {Sebanz2006,Marsh2009,Dale2014}, has directed attention to the ways in which automatic movement strategies anchor information transfer within and between individuals, groups, and throughout populations across space and time. This amounts to a paradigm shift for cognitive science, and helps re-conceptualise cognition as a system situated in and distributed throughout human brains, conscious minds, active bodies, and feature-rich physical environments {Wilson2013}. Traditional individual-centric computational models of cognition, which tend to render movement as the product of a linear sequence of sensory perception, internal mental representation, and action selection, have been superseded by newer theories in which perception, representation, emotion, and action are functionally and temporally integrated in service of highly distributed processes of information regulation and transfer {Clark2013}. Conceiving of social cognition in this way, as an embodied, embedded, and immediate process of inference, centralises the role of automatic movement regulation strategies\emdash traditionally classed as \ldblquote lower-cognitive\rdblquote  processes\emdash in establishing and maintaining the transfer of information between individuals, within groups, and throughout populations\emdash traditionally thought to be executed by \ldblquote higher-cognitive\rdblquote  processes {Claidiere2014}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 From this emerging area of research, 5 core principles are relevant to the social cognition of joint action and social bonding, and as such serve as a theoretical foundation for the present study:\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 1. Human cognition is generated by a multitude of cognitive mechanisms responsible for regulating movement, evidence for which can be identified in a spectrum of social behaviours ranging from more explicit and deliberate communicative signals, through to more implicit (often pre-perceptual) processes of synchronisation and alignment of the organism with the environment {Frith2010,Semin2008}. Prevailing models of social cognition reveal that higher order explicit communication strategies traditionally privileged in computational accounts of cognition (e.g. consciousness, symbolic language, rational thinking), draw on only a small fraction of the total amount of information processed by the nervous system at any one moment {Semin2012}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 2. Human cognition entails \ldblquote active inference\rdblquote  {Friston2010} about the world. Agents generate interoceptive predictions about the state of the world and test these representations against actual bottom-up sensory evidence {Clark2013}. In this conception, known as the predictive processing (PP) hypothesis, the fundamental drive of human cognition is to minimise \ldblquote prediction error,\rdblquote  or the discrepancy between predictions of the world and the bottom-up sensorial experience of the world. In PP, perception, representation, emotion, and action are unified by the logic of prediction-error management, where neurocognitive components work together to align the organism with its expectations and in so doing produce adaptive behaviours {Pezzulo2014}. Related to principle 1, much of the work of predictive processing occurs beneath the level of conscious awareness {Frith2007,Clark2013}. PP appears to be driven by reward mechanisms of neuromodulatory systems, namely the dopaminergic {Schultz2016} and opioidergic {Laurent2014} systems. In addition, however, the embeddedness of neurocognitive processes in broader information-theoretic systems (discussed in principle 3 below) suggests that PP is also determined by a overarching mandate to reduce \ldblquote free energy\rdblquote  (or entropy) in the nervous system\rquote s interaction with the environment {Friston2010}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 3. Human cognition relies on resources that are distributed across neural, bodily, and environmental features of the social and physical environment, supporting action and interaction {Hutchins1995,Kirsh1995,Smith2004}. The embedded and distributed nature of cognition is observable in instances of joint-action, where the time-locked coordination of behaviour with two or more individuals in a physical environment gives rise to functional interpersonal synergies {Riley2011,Coey2012}. These coordinative structures reduce the degrees of freedom of the system components and allow for cognitive resources to be efficiently distributed across all nodes of the emergent dynamical system. The self-organising properties of dynamic coupling in joint-action have been modelled, revealing evidence of multi-scale fractal synchronisation and complexity matching {Schmidt2011,Richardson2012}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 4. Higher quality synchronisation of behaviours in joint-action scenarios has positive implications for individual psychophysiological function, health, and subjective well being {Wheatley2012}. In particular, successful coordination in joint-action has implications for psychological processes relating to social bonding {Marsh2009,Launay2016}. Evidence from the self-report of highly skilled joint-action practitioners (musicians, performers, athletes) suggests a strong link between the perception of high-quality joint-action and psychological wellbeing {Jackson1995,Jackson1992}. Conversely, the psycho-social isolation and ill-health experienced by individuals who suffer from developmental and neurocognitive deficits in behaviours key to dynamic interpersonal interaction is also well-documented [e.g.][]{Blakemore2005,Baron-Cohen1991}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 5. The coupling dynamics of co-present joint action have implications for higher order and more complex goal oriented settings, including the re-production and transmission of shared cultural practices {Dunbar2012,Roepstorff2010,Claidiere2014}.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 A key facet of the paradigm shift in social cognition outlined above is the overhaul of traditional individual-centred computational models of information processing (originally inspired by the mechanics of the electronic computer), which tend to render movement as the final product of a linear sequence of sensory perception, amodal mental representation, and action selection {Lewis2005}. By contrast, the prevailing neurocomputational paradigm of \ldblquote predictive processing,\rdblquote  also known as \ldblquote predictive coding,\rdblquote  [see][]{Frith2007,Kilner2009,Clark2013} offers a model of brain function in which perception, representation, emotion, and action are functionally and temporally integrated in the service of informational processes.\par
\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 4.1.1  Predictive Processing\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Predictive processing (PP) is an attempt to model the way that the brain processes information to produce perception and action. The PP hypothesis depicts a brain that is constantly in the business of predicting probable worldly sources of sensory signals, and adjusting action schemas in order to minimise the error of these predictions (or maximise the precision of these models). Predictive coding first emerged in cognitive science as an explanation for \ldblquote black box\rdblquote  problem of perception, but has since been extended to account for the role of action in cognition {Friston2010}. The human brain confronts a black box problem when attempting to infer the causes in the external world with only partial and indirect access to that world via sensory input signals. This blindness to the precise nature of the world means that the most effective strategy available to the brain is to begin by generating an internal model of the world (no matter how rudimentary it may be initially) and then iteratively update that model in response to \ldblquote errors\rdblquote  that arise from discrepancy between the model and the information from sensory inputs {Frith2007}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 There is mounting neurocomputational evidence to suggest that this inferential strategy is supported in the brain by multilevel and hierarchical arrangement of cortical structures, which enable bi-directional cascades of information between levels. Higher levels of the cortical hierarchy formulate models based on prior experience, which are employed to \ldblquote explain away\rdblquote  sensory signals at lower levels. Lower level signals unaccounted for by higher level predictions are incorporated into higher level structures and strengthen the robustness of the model. Predictive processing has been likened to a process of \ldblquote empirical Bayes,\rdblquote  whereby prediction errors function to strengthen prior probability distributions of models for future inference {Robbins1964}. In a typically Bayesian manner, predictive processes appear capable of factoring representations of uncertainty around sensory signals into the predictive model itself {Clark2013}. The brain\rquote s capacity to quantify the uncertainty of any given sensory state facilitates optimal selection between competing predictions pertaining to the same bottom-up sensory signals, judged probabilistically. At any one moment, an individual has access to multiple hypotheses derived from priors, which compete for the best fit of the sensation, until that process leads to fixation on the best hypothesis for the sensory state. Binocular rivalry, (for example looking at a necker cube) is an instance in which there is insufficient sensory information available in order to reach fixation on one model over another (see Image \~{\field{\*\fldinst{\lang1024 REF BMfig_neckerCube \\* MERGEFORMAT }}{\fldrslt{?}}} {Frith2007}.\par

}}\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb360 \fi0 4.1.2  Active Inference\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Importantly, in the case of motor systems, the agents are able to move their sensors in ways that amount to actively seeking or generating the sensory consequences that they (or rather, their brains) expect. In this way, \ldblquote error signals self-suppress, not through neuronally mediated effects, but by eliciting movements that change bottom-up proprioceptive and sensory input\rdblquote  [186]{Clark2013}. Perception, representation, and action functionally and temporally integrate to fulfil an ever evolving set of sub-personal expectations about the state of the world. Perception, cognition, and action work closely together to minimise sensory prediction errors by selectively sampling, and actively sculpting, the stimulus array.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 {Neurobiological underpinnings of PP and the role of emotion} The PP hypothesis is also underwritten by a plausible neurobiological account. Specifically, the complex cortical processes of prediction error management appear to be fundamentally mediated by the activity of the dopaminergic system {Schultz2016}, while subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as those responsible for producing norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and endogenous opioids, appear to be involved in attuning cortical processing to signals from the body and environment that are important for survival {Lewis2005}. There is now evidence to suggest that complex cognitive processes\emdash  traditionally understood to be confined to cortical regions\emdash  and subcortical neuromodulatory systems\emdash  tradtionally understood to be responsible only for affective response and exogenous to the brain\rquote s inferential processes\emdash  work in a loop of reciprocal interaction in order to enhance processes of error management {Damasio1994,Lewis2005,Miller2017,Barrett2017}. Emotions can in this sense be understood more as superordinate programs for regulating disparate subordinate cognitive modules for the purposes of global coordination with the environment {Cosmides2000}. By collapsing the common neurocognitive distinction between cortical and subcortical processes, PP, in addition to unifying perception, representation, and movement in a common theoretical framework, also helps integrate the role of affective processes into \ldblquote active inference.\rdblquote \par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 The distinction between cognition and emotion is supported by the idea that segregated brain areas implement cognitive and emotional functions and that there are two independent processing routes, one cognitive/controlled and one emotional/automatic, which usually compete (but also occasionally cooperate) to control behaviour {Kahneman2003}. However useful this \ldblquote dual-systems\rdblquote  view has been thus far in cognitive science, prevailing evidence concerning the complexity of functional integration and segregation of brain processes challenges the cognitive-emotional distinction {Pessoa2013}. The emerging view is not only that cognition interacts with emotion at many levels, but that in many respects they are functionally integrated and continuously impact each other\rquote s processing.\par
\pard\plain\s5\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs24\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 4.1.3  The Free Energy Principle\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 This formulation of PP relies on rather narrowly defined neurocentric mechanics, albeit ones that reveal intimate links between perception, representations, emotion, and action. For the purposes of analysing complex multi-modal and multi-agent joint actions it is important to understand how the brain is situated within larger distributed cognitive systems. It has been suggested, for example, that the brain\rquote s overarching cognitive principle of error minimisation should be understood as a consequence of a more fundamental mandate to minimise the informational degrees of freedom or \ldblquote free energy\rdblquote  in a system\rquote s exchanges with the environment {Friston2010}. Thermodynamic free energy is a measure of the energy available to a system to do useful \ldblquote work\rdblquote , i.e. work that contributes to the maintenance of system structure and organisation {Stoner2000}. Transposed to the cognitive domain, free energy emerges as the difference between the way the world is {\i represented} as being, and the way it actually {\i is}. Thus, the better the model fit, the lower the information-theoretic free energy, or in other words, more of the system\rquote s resources are being put to effective work in representing the world. In this formulation, \ldblquote surprisal\rdblquote  (deliberately distinguished from surprise by Tribus {Tribus1961}) is a measure of sub-personally computed implausibility of some sensory state given a model of the world {Clark2013}. Entropy, in turn, can be understood as the long-term average of surprisal, or the informational cost for representing the sensory input by its internal model {Little2013}. Thus, good models of the world reduce surprisal and therefore achieve lower entropy. The Free Energy principle draws attention to the fact that the brain\rquote s neurcomputational processes do not happen in isolation, but instead are embedded within larger biophysical and information-theoretical systems which constrain and direct their function.\par
\pard\plain\s4\ql\sb240\sa120\keepn\f0\b\fs32\sl240\slmult1 \sb120 \fi0 4.2  Functional Interpersonal Synergies\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 Explaining active inference within a larger framework of free-energy minimisation in a system\rquote s exchanges with the environment is in line with a broader recognition of the ways in which complex biological and information-theoretic systems both support and constrain processes of human social cognition {Dale2014}. The human brain, body, and the various functional behavioural synergies that humans form in social interaction, are all examples of dynamical systems of varying scales, whose physiological and cognitive parameters enforce constraints on the expression of their componential mechanisms. Situating the activity of the brain in the constraints inherent in real-time and online social interactions is necessary for a full appreciation of the nervous system\rquote s role in the organisation of social behaviour and cognition {Coey2012}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 For a brain in the business of prediction error minimisation, interpersonal interactions with other agents present a computational challenge due to the moving parts. The large number of independently controllable movement system degrees of freedom of multiple agents places computational burden to the central nervous system, dubbed by Bernstein {Bernstein1967} as the \ldblquote degrees-of-freedom problem\rdblquote  [see also][]{Turvey1982,Turvey1990}. From a system dynamics perspective, a solution to this problem is to work in such a way that the movement system degrees of freedom residing in different actors and environmental features are coupled to form low-dimensional, reciprocally compensating synergies, known as \ldblquote functional interpersonal synergies\rdblquote  {Riley2011}. Much like intrapersonal coordination, functional interpersonal synergies are temporarily assembled, task-specific, functional couplings between a system\rquote s componential degrees of freedom, such that one component of a synergy reacts to changes in the others {Kelso2009}. Once coordinated to behave as a functional unit, the individual degrees-of-freedom do not need to be controlled independently of one another, and perturbations applied to a component are automatically compensated by the coupled components {Kelso1984,Latash2002,Riley2011}, making them adaptive responses to environments of high computational uncertainty. Experimental evidence has shown that functional interpersonal synergies, for example in-phase or anti-phase coordination of hand movements, facilitates memory recall of incidental information concerning co-actors {Miles2010}. It has also been shown that interpersonal synergies more generally facilitate performance of social cognitive or linguistic tasks, such as gaze coordination and turn taking in conversation {Richardson2005,Shockley2009}. Richardson and Dale (2005), for example, show that more tightly coupled gaze between conversing dyads leads to higher discourse comprehension. Conversely, being psychologically distanced from another individual can inhibit the emergence of interpersonal synergies {Miles2010}. The ways in which functional interpersonal synergies facilitate adaptive information transfer between individuals and within groups suggests that psychological mechanisms and cultural practices responsible for generating these synergies could have been subject to cultural evolutionary forces of selection and attraction {Claidiere2014,Mesoudi2016a}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 Considered form within the PP and Free Energy principle paradigms, interpersonal synergies represent one way in which error minimisation can be achieved via extra-neural mechanisms. In addition to the behavioural mimicry and synchrony literatures mentioned above, research into the coordination dynamics of natural joint actions has shown evidence of dynamic coupling (synchronisation) in joint-action tasks, such as dancing, martial arts, moving objects like furniture, etc. In these studies, specific component degrees of freedom are modelled as coupled oscillators (using the HKB model {Haken1985,Kelso1986}, which describes the change in the relative phase between two oscillatory components). Models are analysed for non-random fluctuations in relative phase over multiple time scales. This type of synchronisation is said to be of a fractal or semi-fractal organisation, also known as 1/f scaling or \ldblquote pink noise\rdblquote  {Caron2017}. According to Anderson and colleagues {Anderson2012}, 1\u195?\u162?\u194?\u32?\u194?\u8222?f scaling is ubiquitous in smooth cognitive activity, and indicates a self-similar structure in the fluctuations that occur over time (within a time series of measurements). 1\u195?\u162?\u194?\u32?\u194?\u8222?f scaling indicates that the connections among the cognitive system\rquote s components are highly nonlinear {Ding2002,Holden2013,Kello2010,Riley2011,VanOrden2003,VanOrden2005}. Pink noise has been measured beyond dyadic synchronisation, in the analysis of sub-phases of team sports {Passos2014,Duarte2012} and group dancing {Chauvigne2017}.{\cs62\super\chftn}
{\*\footnote\pard \s65\ql\fi-113\li397\lin397\f0\fs20{\cs62\super\chftn} 1\u195?\u162?\u194?\u32?\u194?\u8222?f scaling is temporal long-range dependencies in the fluctuations of a repeatedly measured behaviour or activity. Analogous to spatial fractals, 1\u195?\u162?\u194?\u32?\u194?\u8222? f scaling denotes a fractal or self-similar structure in the fluctuations that occur over time. That is, higher frequency, lower amplitude fluctuations are nested within lower frequency, higher amplitude fluctuations as one moves from finer to courser grains of analysis (for a more detailed description see, for example)(){Holden2005}{Kello2009}}
\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 In studies involving skilled versus non-skilled practitioners in dyadic interactions, it has been shown that more skilled practitioners create stronger dynamical coupling through flexibly modulating their actions with others {Schmidt2011, Caron2017}. These findings are corroborated by other studies that find that professional footballers (versus novice controls) are able to more accurately predict the direction of a kick from another player\rquote s body kinematics (

] for similar results with basketball and dart players). Interestingly, when analysing co-regulation between members of basketball teams, it was shown by Bourbousson {Bourbousson2015} that more expert teams made fewer mutual adjustments (at the level of the activity that was meaningful for co-actors), suggesting an enhanced capability of expert social systems to achieve and maintain an optimal level of awareness during the unfolding activity, potentially implicating down-regulation of prediction error management processes.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 In order to conceptualise the intuition surrounding the social pull of active inference and interpersonal synergy formation, imagine for a moment that your office colleague suddenly threw a soft rubber \ldblquote stress ball\rdblquote  in your direction without warning. A conceivable automatic response would be to move your hand or hands into a position to catch the ball. Catching the ball could be understood as a discrete, volitional action output to an external sensory input stimulus. However, the action response can also be understood as participation in a distributed cognitive system containing the ball, the office, your office colleague, as well as the higher-order interoceptive predictions (representations) through which an inference is made that the ball is an object to be caught (an not avoided, in the case that scissors were thrown instead!). In this sense, catching the ball is the most efficient strategy to reduce uncertainty inherent in the cognitive system due to bottom-up sensory inputs resulting from your office colleague\rquote s decision to throw the ball. This example demonstrates the phenomenon of being \ldblquote pulled in to the orbit\rdblquote  of joint action {Marsh2009}, a sensation that is often accompanied by an experience of loss or lack of individual agency. The function of the individual, in this conception of cognition, is to facilitate physical movement in such a way as to reduce the uncertainty of the overall system-distributed cognition. Attempting to catch the ball is response to the affordances and constraints of the cognitive system in which you are embedded. }\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 \fs0 \par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi0 \fs0 The key task of this dissertation is understanding in what ways cognitive mechanisms relating to interpersonal movement coordination facilitate psycho-social processes of alignment, affiliation, and cultural transmission{Marsh2009}. Establishing functional interpersonal synergies is an adaptive response to the \ldblquote degrees-of-freedom problem\rdblquote  encountered by the nervous system in social interactions involving many moving parts. Synergies have been shown to act as an extra-neural basis for prediction error minimisation, aid reciprocal information sharing throughout system nodes, and increase individual cognitive performance {Schmidt2016}. The link between interpersonal coordination and social bonding has been addressed in the behavioural mimicry and synchrony literatures [e.g.,][]{Wheatley2012,Launay2016,Mogan2017}, but there is less substantive evidence in relation to dynamic interpersonal coordination in natural joint action settings such as those found in group exercise contexts {Marsh2009,Miles2009,Lumsden2012}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 There is, however, an extensive literature detailing the phenomenology of optimal human performance which suggests that this link may be present and testable. Reports of optimal states of subjective well-being are usually associated with activities involving complex patterns of intra- and inter-personal coordination {Jackson1996}. This literature also includes the notion of \ldblquote group flow\rdblquote  {Sawyer2006,Noy2015}, or as I have termed it in this dissertation, team click. Flow and team click are reported as a visceral autotelic sensation. Often, athletes or other practitioners will report feelings of loss of personal agency, and a slowing down or speeding up of time. The experience of altered states of consciousness in joint action suggests that the movement regulation processes that mediate the psycho-social phenomenon of team click may be predominantly pre-conscious and pre-declarative, generating experiences that practitioners find difficult to express verbally {Jackson1996,Semin2008,Rufi2015}. It is generally agreed that much of the predictive coding processes of error minimisation and interoceptive model generation occur beneath the level of conscious awareness{Frith2007,Clark2013}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 The dilemma inherent in the PP hypothesis is the fact that, logically, the most suitable environment for error minimisation would resemble a theoretical \ldblquote dark room\rdblquote \emdash an environment in which stochastic information (or lack thereof) would not perturb prediction error minimisation systems{Little2013}. Strict adherence to the free energy principle would suggest that human brains will seek an environment that facilitates a snug fit between interoceptive representations and sensory inputs. In the case of joint action, for example, strictly adhering to the PP hypothesis would lead to the prediction that the system state responsible for maximal psychological reward in participants would be one in which the expectations of co-actors were aligned in an exact 1:1 symmetry with each other and the affordances in the task-specific environment (i.e., a complete minimisation of free energy).\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 Evidence from social, comparative, developmental, and evolutionary psychology, by contrast, demonstrates that human behaviour is defined by clear propensities for play, exploration, and norm-violation, as much as it is defined by motivations for coherence, conciliation, and norm-adherence {McNeill1995,Huizinga2003}. In addition, as has been pointed out above, interindividual differentiation of behaviour in joint action appears to confer psychosocial benefits as much as exact behavioural matching {Milward2016}. In addition, social psychological research on group identification and commitment suggests that the most potent psychology of group membership is not one in which the self concept is replaced by that of the group, but instead a state of \ldblquote identity fusion,\rdblquote  whereby the self is distinctly differentiated from the group while at the same time being empowered by it\rquote s identity {Swann2012,Swann2015,Whitehouse2014}. Thus, while the free energy principle defines processes of error minimisation and synergy formation in human social cognition, this principle occurs within the backdrop of a complex set of expectations or \ldblquote hyper-priors\rdblquote  evolutionarily encoded in the organism and manifest, in the case of humans, in behaviours of play, curiosity, hunger, and thirst{Clark2013}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 The theoretical extreme of the dark room dilemma is also refuted by neuroeconomic models that suggest neuro-modulatory subsystems such as the dopaminergic reward system function semi-independently of general cortical processing and thus drive reward, attention, and further reward seeking exploratory actions{Ross2013}. Thus, team click\emdash the psychological experience of optimal coordination in joint action\emdash could refer to a statistical sweet spot between collective error minimisation and degree of system complexity; a system that is sufficiently coherent but also sufficiently differentiated and dynamic in in terms of action role assignment. It is plausible that this dynamic blend of cognitive coherence and differentiation is associated with evolved psychophysiological mechanisms of reward that coordinate to support adaptive behaviour{Friston2010,Clark2013}.\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 \fs0 Observation and anecdote in sport suggests that part of the exhilarating nature of team click is the way in which the experience of joint action induces positively valenced surprise, or in other words, positively violates athletes\rquote  prior expectations for joint action {Jackson1999}. Indeed, unsuccessful joint action appears to induce an inverse, negatively valenced violation of expectation, linked to emotional states of displeasure {Ekkekakis2003}. This phenomenon can be understood, in part at least, in light of the predictive processing hypothesis outlined above: individuals generate interoceptive action-oriented representations of the world and test those predictions in a process of \ldblquote active inference.\rdblquote  Surprisal in this inferential cognitive process is simply prediction error that is subsequently fed-back to the cognitive system for the purposes of tuning and enhancing models of future action and inference{Clark2013}. As discussed above, processes of prediction error management and minimisation are underwritten by neurobiological systems of reward, particularly the dopaminergic system {Schultz2013} and the opioidergic system to which, there is some evidence to suggest, the dopaminergic system may be yoked {Pecina2013,Laurent2014}. Attentional models of learning suggest that when events are surprising, they collect and focus neural resources that enhance the processing of the event and drive learning. Thus, these systems function not only by rewarding accurate predictions, but also by neuro-economically calibrating incentivise for learning behaviours\emdash such as exploration, play, and norm-violation\emdash through which novel information can be acquired{Little2013}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 It has therefore been hypothesised that emotional states related to expectation violation perform an evolutionary function as signals for adaptive organismic regulation, which includes the updating of shared task representations and motivations for future behaviour{Cosmides2000,Barrett2017}. While many details of the link between expectation violation and global emotional states experienced by individuals and collectives remain poorly understood, evidence suggests that surprise is a basal emotion that can carry both positive or negative valences {Ortony1990}. Presumably, the specific valence of surprise is contingent on the specific content of a whole series of hierarchically structured prior expectations informed by cognitive biases, learning heuristics, and specific cultural ecological niches (discussed above). In the case of joint action in particular, It can be predicted that unfolding joint action will either confirm or violate an individual\rquote s prior expectations, which are informed by both explicit and implicit informational inputs. Expectation violation could be {\i positive}, in the case that unfolding joint action is of higher quality than expected. Expectation violation could also be {\i negative}, owing to the perception that the unfolding joint action was of lower quality than expected. It is also possible to predict that this spectrum of prediction error management contributes in a meaningful way to equivalent spectrum of emotional states {Pessoa2014}, As-expected or better-than-expected coordination could, for example, contribute to a positively valenced emotional response, in the form of euphoric arousal. Negative violation of expectations could lead to a negatively valenced dissonant emotional response. }\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 \fs0 The link between expectation violation and social bonding has been most explicitly made in the case of {\i negative} violations of expectations. Evidence from cognitive dissonance theory {Festinger1957} suggests that individuals experience visceral emotions of guilt due to a tension that arises between perceptions of individual performance (in a range of experimental tasks) and internalised group-level expectations that sanction and valorise certain normative behaviours over others{Kenworthy2011,Stone2001}. The tension between these cognitions relating to self and group can be resolved via two conceivable paths: 1) by adjusting behaviour in such a way that it aligns with the dominant, pre-established group-level representation, or 2) reject a belief in the group-level expectation in favour of an alternative hypothesis that supports the individual-level cognition. Theoretically, both paths are equally plausible, but it appears that, in ultra-social human ecologies, honouring a belief in group-level expectations is often the most viable. This is evidence by the evolved psychological power of internalisation and habituation of group-level norms {Chudek2011}, and the ways in which cultural practices have evolved to incentivise submission to group-level representations\emdash for example, either participating in rites of initiation or facing permanent exile or summary execution[cf.][18]{Whitehouse2014}\emdash over radical individual-level re-evaluation{Sosis2003}. Mechanisms of dissonance-activated pro-sociality and costly group commitment appear to be particularly relevant to the relationship between extreme ritual practices involving significant individual-level cost (fire walking, self-immolation, fasting, etc.) and social bonding{Sosis2003,Xygalatas2013,Bastian2014,Fischer2014,Whitehouse2014}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 It has been suggested that negative \ldblquote dysphoric arousal\rdblquote  is a more powerful and enduring emotional state than \ldblquote euphoric arousal,\rdblquote  and therefore a more effective mechanism for social bonding {Whitehouse1996,Whitehouse2004}. This assertion is verifiable in the anthropological record, in which dysphoric arousal is more predominantly exploited in extreme ritual practices {Atkinson2011,Whitehouse2014}. This explanation does not, however, account for the entirety of highly arousing cultural practices, nor does it preclude other cognitive and affective pathways to social bonding {Downey2014,Xygalatas2014,Fischer2014,Fischer2014a}. Culturally orchestrated experiences of euphoric arousal also abound, particularly in the case of modern sport, as the phenomenon of team click attests. Indeed, perhaps one explanation for the cultural evolutionary success of sport is the way in which it exploits {\i both} positive and negative emotional arousal\emdash the joy of victory and the pain of defeat responsible for activating distinct but interrelated pathways to social bonding and group commitment. }\par

\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \sb60 \fi0 \fs0 Exploring alternative pathways to social bonding, particularly pathways that involve positively valenced expectation violation, requires a more nuanced theoretical account of the social dimensions of euphoric arousal in cultural practices such as those that involve group exercise. Within the psychology of well-being, researchers have for some time recognised important distinctions between two states (and traits) of well-being, namely hedonia and eudaimonia {Ryff1989}. Whereas hedonia refers to more subjective and transient modes of positive affect, eudaimonia refers to a psychological motivation for deeper meaning or \ldblquote human flourishing,\rdblquote  and is identified in particular psychological (character) traits or \ldblquote virtues\rdblquote  {Baumeister2013}. Virtues represent stable individual- or group-level patterns of behaviour (or activity, as it is referred to in the Aristotelian tradition) of an objective moral quality {Fowers2015}. The virtue of \ldblquote resilience\rdblquote , for example, involves the activity of transforming pain or loss into sources of insight and deepened understanding of self and others {Ryff2015}; and \ldblquote loyalty\rdblquote  entails the activity of commitment and successful group membership {Fowers2015}. Eudaimonic well-being relates to behaviour in which personal growth, self-acceptance, purpose in life, autonomy, and positive relations with others can be achieved, and is a substantial predictor of life events, including many factors of health and well being {Ryff2004,Urry2004}.\par
\pard\plain\s0\qj\widctlpar\f0\fs20\sl240\slmult1 \fi300 \fs0 These two psychological constructs of positive well-being\emdash hedonia and eudaimonia\emdash have recently been analysed at the neuro-cognitive level {Berridge2011}, with studies identifying neural correlates of eudaimonic well-being distinct from hedonia {Lewis2014}. It appears that hedonic processes generated by immediate sensory inputs function as the foundation for higherorder eudaimonic pleasures sensations, through processes of conditioning, association, and learning {Berridge2003}. In this way, eudaimonic and hedonic well-being are distinct but interrelated components of positive well-being, with eudaimonic well-being reliant on hedonic affect as its foundation {Berridge2011}. This evidence provides a much more nuanced picture of positive affect, and in particular demonstrates that positive emotional valence in active inference is contingent on action cohering with a complex assemblage of socially mediated expectations, and not simply hedonic reward from local sensory stimulation. Considered from this perspective, euphoric arousal experienced in cultural activities is inextricably social and therefore relevant to processes of social bonding. As anecdote and observations concerning team click suggests, the \ldblquote click\rdblquote  is not limited to the most proximal dimensions of joint action perception, but is rather contingent on the snug fit between a given joint action and a whole assemblage of hierarchically ordered expectations with implications for group membership and social cohesion. }\par
